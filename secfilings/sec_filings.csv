Business
Overview
Yext, Inc. (""Yext"" or the ""Company"") organizes a business's facts so it can provide official answers to consumer questions starting with the business's own website and then extending across search engines and voice assistants. Our platform lets businesses structure the facts about their brands in a database called the Knowledge Graph. Our platform is built to leverage the structured data stored in the Knowledge Graph to deliver a modern search experience on a business’s or organization's own website, as well as across approximately 200 service and application providers, which we refer to as our Knowledge Network, and includes Amazon Alexa, Apple Maps, Bing, Cortana, Facebook, Google, Google Assistant, Google Maps, Siri and Yelp. Our platform powers all of our key features, including Listings, Pages, and Answers, along with its other features and capabilities. We believe a business is the ultimate authority on its own facts, and it is our mission to put that business in control of it, everywhere.
The online consumer journey is changing. With the introduction of natural language processing and the growing prevalence of voice assistants and chatbots, search has become more conversational. Consumers are no longer just typing in individual keywords like “mortgage” or “menswear,” but are also using natural language phrases like “wealth advisor near me who specializes in healthcare” and even asking specific, complex questions like “what’s the best menswear store in London that sells dress shirts and is open now?” Web and mobile applications and voice and artificial intelligence, or AI, engines are increasingly answering questions directly and in certain cases providing only one answer unlike traditional web-based search where many results are displayed as a list requiring further exploration. As search continues to evolve, and increasingly leverages AI, consumers are more likely to rely on these direct answers.
While consumer online search behavior has changed, the site search experience on many businesses’ websites has not evolved to meet consumer expectations. Numerous site searches are unable to understand natural language queries instead returning a list of links based on keywords rather than direct answers. Poor user experience on a business’s own website may result in lost sales opportunities or may cause consumers to visit a competitor’s website. The challenge for businesses is to understand and provide accurate answers to consumer’s questions while delivering a rich, consistent search experience on their website as well as third-party applications. Many answers and results provided by searches currently come from third-party sources such as data aggregators, governmental agencies and consumers. The net result of this third-party sourcing has been to produce “best guess” data that can often be incomplete, misleading or incorrect.
Yext pioneered a better way for businesses to control and publish the critical facts about themselves to answer consumer questions. We have built our business on the fundamental premise that the best source of accurate and timely information about a business is the business itself. We do this first by empowering brands to structure the public facts about themselves in a database called the Knowledge Graph. The Knowledge Graph organizes data in a way that can answer complex questions by storing both data points themselves and the multiple relationships between data points. Our products and features are built to leverage the structured data stored in the Knowledge Graph so businesses can provide official answers to consumer questions.
Businesses of nearly all sizes and in a diverse set of industries can benefit from our platform and capabilities. Yext enables businesses to:
•provide direct answers to consumer questions about their business on their own website;
•modify, enhance and control the facts about each of their locations, professionals, menus, events or other entities managed with our platform;
•update once and disseminate changes to their listings across the most widely used third-party maps, apps, search engines, GPS systems, digital assistants, vertical directories and social networks that consumers rely upon today;
•create and update search-optimized landing pages for their locations, professionals and events on their own websites;
•encourage consumer reviews for inclusion on their landing pages; and
•analyze how features in the platform drive consumer engagement and revenue for our customers.
Industry Background
Search Results Provide Direct Answers. Search that is powered by AI has grown significantly in recent years. Businesses are now able to leverage search to help consumers discover what they need directly on the search engine results page.
Consumers Search Using Natural Language. Consumers are no longer just typing in individual keywords, but are also using natural language phrases and even asking specific, complex questions. Businesses need to be able to understand those questions and answer them accurately and directly.
Facts About a Business Are Fundamental. Businesses spend significant sums on developing their brands and creating product and market awareness. When potential consumers reached through those efforts want to make a purchase, businesses need to be able to answer consumers' questions accurately and directly. Inaccurate or incomplete information may result in lost sales opportunities, negative brand experiences and organizational inefficiencies.
Search Drives Commerce. When searching for a business, consumers need to know many relevant attributes such as qualifications of a wealth advisor, amenities at a hotel, or course offerings at a university. As a result, businesses must ensure that the facts about their business are available, accurate and consistent online so that they can be found. Moreover, businesses want to make sure that they appear prominently online when nearby consumers search for them. Finally, once a consumer reaches a business’s website ready to transact, the business must be ready to answer the consumer’s specific queries.
Managing Facts Online Is Challenging
Many businesses lack the capabilities to effectively control, structure and manage facts across the digital ecosystem where consumers discover businesses. This lack of management capability is due to several factors:
•Lack of Control of Facts Online. Many answers and results provided by searches currently come from third-party sources such as data aggregators, governmental agencies and consumers. The net result of this third-party sourcing has been to produce “best guess” data that can often miss or misstate the true facts about businesses worldwide.
•Attributes that Describe the Facts About a Business Are Expanding. To respond to consumer questions, businesses need to be able to define the facts about their business using detailed, category-specific attributes ranging from name, address and phone number to more detailed items such as whether a hotel accepts pets, a restaurant has a gluten-free menu or a doctor accepts certain insurance plans.
•Facts About a Business Are Dynamic. The facts about a business include dynamic attributes that change frequently, such as opening hours, holiday hours, menus, events and promotions.
•Facts About a Business Exist in Many Places. With popular services such as Google, Facebook and Yelp, as well as vertical search applications and search leveraging AI using mobile, voice-based and in-app search, businesses need an efficient way to control their facts across these multitude of services.
Businesses Need to Provide Consumers with Relevant and Actionable Information. When consumers ask questions about businesses, they expect to be able to quickly find the relevant information they need about those organizations. Furthermore, the increase in the number of mobile users around the world has resulted in the need for business information to be available on the applications where consumers engage and to be presented in a way that is consistent with the language and customs of each geography in which consumers reside.
Existing Alternatives Are Inadequate. Traditional methods for managing facts about brands include paper or legacy software-based solutions, such as word processors or spreadsheets. Simply managing and updating information within the few core search engines, such as Google and Bing, through these traditional methods is already very challenging, and becomes even more so when implementing updates on newer services such as Instagram, Snapchat and Uber.
Poor Site Search Experience Results in Lost Transactions. While consumer online search behavior has changed, we believe the site search experience on many businesses' websites has not evolved to meet consumer expectations. Many site searches are unable to understand natural language queries and instead return a list of links based on keywords rather than direct answers. Poor site search experience on a business’s own website may result in lost sales opportunities or may cause consumers to visit a competitor’s website.
Consumer Reviews Are of Critical Importance. Many major applications include consumer review data in their search results and may rank businesses and professional service providers based on the number, quality and recency of reviews. A limited number of reviews or a few poor reviews without offsetting positive reviews may result in an otherwise lower search ranking in certain applications.
Growth Strategy
Key elements of our strategy include:
•Grow Our Customer Base. We believe that there is a substantial opportunity to continue to increase the size of our customer base across a broad range of industries and companies. In October 2019 with the launch of Yext Answers, our site search product, we further expanded our customer base to include businesses that maintain websites but without physical locations, such as consumer product businesses. We plan to continue to invest in our direct sales force to grow our customer base, both domestically and internationally.
•Expand Existing Customer Relationships. We continue to expand our relationships with existing customers. For example, some businesses may initially purchase our platform only for their stores in a particular country with opportunities to expand to other stores in the geographic region. We continue to sell additional features, such as Pages,
Reviews and Answers, to existing customers. See ""-Sales and Marketing"" for a discussion of customer retention and our ability to expand customer relationships.
•Expand Internationally. We sell our platform throughout the world and believe there are substantial opportunities to increase sales to customers outside of the United States as well as to help our existing U.S.-based customers manage data for more of their international business. We have an established presence in the United Kingdom, Germany, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, Switzerland, Japan and China and we intend to further expand our footprint to other regions.
•Develop and Market New Products and Features. We are committed to developing and marketing innovative capabilities and we will continue to invest in our platform and develop products and features to help our customers better control the facts about their businesses online. For example, in October 2019 we launched Yext Answers, our site search product. In the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021, we expanded Yext Answers into five new languages, French, German, Italian, Spanish and Japanese, and enhanced Yext Answers with two major algorithm upgrades.
•Drive Usage of Our Platform. Our customer success professionals are responsible for building relationships with customers, increasing customer’s adoption and engagement with the Yext platform. In the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021, we launched the Hitchhikers program, a comprehensive training program and community for professionals to develop the skills to build custom search solutions for their business using our platform.
•Extend the Knowledge Network. We plan to continue to expand our Knowledge Network. In the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021 our Knowledge Network is comprised of approximately 200 applications. We are increasing our focus on adding more industry vertical-specific and international services to our Knowledge Network as well as including new services that may become more commonly used in the future. For example, in the fiscal year ended January 31, 2019 we launched a global integration with Amazon to give businesses control over the answers Amazon Alexa provides about them, and in the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021, we launched an integration with WebMD, while expanding the global reach of the Knowledge Network through multiple integrations with international applications.
•Expand Our App Directory. Yext offers integrations with a number of other platforms accessible through the Yext App Directory. These integrations offer our customers the ability to connect Yext with other systems to give customers programmatic control of their organization’s facts. As the number of integrations in the Yext App Directory grows, we believe that it will further expand the ways that our platform can be utilized and increase customer retention. For example, in the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021, we launched the WordPress Answers Connector, a plugin that allows WordPress users to seamlessly integrate Yext Answers into WordPress pages.
Key Benefits of Our Platform
The Yext platform provides the following benefits depending on a customer’s subscription level and enabled products and features:
•Control over Facts. Our platform is the system of record that enables our customers to control and centralize the facts about their businesses, resulting in the elimination of inaccurate and duplicate data and the ability to seamlessly update data across our Knowledge Network.
•Flexibility for Optimized Management of Business Attributes. Our technology enables businesses to develop structured data that suits their business needs and is optimized for search and discovery. Our platform gives businesses the ability to organize, edit and update the facts about their business based on numerous standard attribute fields, such as address and hours of operation, and increase the depth of their data using our extensible custom fields, such as menu options or accepted insurance plans.
•Direct Integrations with the Most Relevant Services. Our platform, coupled with our Knowledge Network of approximately 200 maps, apps, search engines, intelligent GPS systems, digital assistants, vertical directories and social networks, provides our customers with the ability to update their information and content across this network with a single click.
•Increased Discoverability and Conversions. With structured data stored in the Knowledge Graph coupled with the applications in our Knowledge Network, our customers provide search engines and voice assistants with the data they need to answer questions about their businesses. By providing accurate and direct answers to questions and guiding consumers to transact directly from search results, we believe businesses are able to capture, convert and retain more of their customers.
•Create and Manage Compelling Landing Pages for Consumers at Scale. Yext Pages enables businesses to create and manage compelling landing pages on their website at scale using the Knowledge Graph. When data is updated on a business’s Knowledge Graph, Yext automatically publishes the changes to a business's website, so that the most accurate, up-to-date answers are available to customers on and off a business's website.
•Ability to Drive More Reviews and Increase Consumer Engagement. Yext Reviews helps our customers to gather additional genuine consumer reviews and add those reviews to a customer's website as well as monitor and respond to reviews posted across the Knowledge Network.
•Ability to Perform Advanced Analytics. Our platform's advanced analytics inform businesses about their digital public presence and consumer interactions on their Yext Listing, Pages and Answers experiences that can drive customer revenue.
•Reduced Support Costs. Yext Answers helps consumers find information quickly and easily on a business’s own website without having to contact a support center or chatbot.
•Global Reach and Local Expertise. Our platform integrates with both global and country-specific search engines and applications, accepts international address and phone number data, and allows local employees to contribute individual expertise, providing a consumer experience that respects local languages, address formats and customs.
The Yext Platform
Yext's cloud-based platform powers products and features that allow our customers to provide accurate and direct answers to consumer questions, to control the facts about their businesses and the content of their landing pages and to manage their consumer reviews, all from a single login. From our platform customers can centralize, control and manage data fields, including store information such as name, address, phone number and holiday hours; professional information such as headshot, specialties or education; job information such as title and description; FAQs and more. Our customers can then use this data to answer consumers' questions, to power and update their landing pages and to make this information available through our Knowledge Network of approximately 200 maps, apps, search engines, intelligent GPS systems, digital assistants, vertical directories and social networks in a complete, up to date and accurate manner.
The key products and features that comprise the Yext platform include:
•Listings. Listings allows our customers to sync and update the content they store in the Yext platform across our Knowledge Network providing customers with greater control and consistency over their brand.
•Pages. Pages enables businesses to create landing pages on their website to capture traffic from search engines and establish a call-to-action for consumers who reach those pages.
•Answers. Answers delivers a natural-language search experience on a company’s website and other digital properties, where consumers can search a company’s Knowledge Graph and get direct answers in the form of knowledge cards, maps and other relevant results.
Our platform contains various other features. Reviews enables customers to encourage and facilitate reviews, thereby increasing the quantity and quality of the reviews available to potential consumers and provides tools to manage their reviews from multiple sources across our Knowledge Network from a single location. Analytics provides businesses a holistic view of where and how consumers interact with their brand both on their own websites and on third-party applications as well as insight into consumer interactions on their Yext Listing, Pages and Answers experiences that can drive customer revenue. Ultimately, our platform helps businesses deliver accurate, consistent, up to date and compelling information to consumers.
In September 2020, Yext announced the general availability of Hitchhikers, a comprehensive training program and community for professionals, who use Yext. With the launch of Hitchhikers, professionals are now able to build custom search solutions for their business using our platform. We continue to invest in platform and features development to help our customers better control the facts about their business and have released new products and features to all of our customers multiple times a year.
Our Technology
Our cloud-based platform is designed to scale as we continue to add customers and allows us to support the entities managed with our platform and the millions of associated facts. The platform is built primarily with industry-standard open source technology. We use a microservices-based architecture to maximize the manageability, flexibility and scalability of our software as it continues to grow more complex. We also employ a modern continuous delivery approach to building, testing and deploying our software.
Hosting
The majority of our customer-facing software is run from two co-location data centers. To provide the highest level of up-time and lowest latency for our platform capabilities, key high-volume services are hosted by third-party hosting services, which allows easier and greater scalability and provides for redundancy.
Data Structure
The Yext platform allows customers to collect, store and manage structured data, consistent with standards published by schema.org. Schema.org is an open and collaborative initiative launched by certain large search engines that defines the vocabulary
and format for structured markup. Search engines like Google and Bing consume data through structured markup placed in the underlying code of web pages.
We actively monitor and track the schema.org standards so that our platform stores and publishes data in accordance with the most current schema.org specifications.
Integrations with our Knowledge Network and App Directory
The functionality of our platform is dependent on integrations with a variety of third-party technologies that comprise our Knowledge Network and App Directory. For example, we rely on integrations with each of the applications in our Knowledge Network to accomplish some or all of the following key tasks with members of our Knowledge Network:
•search for existing listings and retrieve details about them, in order to match our customers’ data in the Knowledge Graph to existing listing data;
•claim listings and deliver updated content;
•retrieve or get notified about reviews and allow review response; and
•obtain statistics about traffic on listings to display to our customers in the platform.
Yext’s integrations through its App Directory offer our customers the ability to connect Yext with other systems to enable customers to accomplish key tasks including the following:
•powering chatbots with data stored in the Knowledge Graph;
•joining insights from Yext with other platforms to perform deeper business analysis;
•optimize marketing campaigns with location data stored in the Knowledge Graph; and
•optimize scheduling and appointment bookings.
Over the years, we have developed special integrations with a number of the applications in our Knowledge Network and App Directory. We have also worked with the major application providers to develop trust and strong working relationships, resulting in specific operational workflows, processes for issue resolution, and specialized technology and processes tailored to the nuances of each. For smaller application providers, we have developed our own application programming interface, or API specifications that each provider builds and implements for integration with our platform.
Our Customers
We serve businesses with locations throughout the world. These include many leading businesses in a diverse set of industries, such as healthcare, retail and financial services. For this purpose, we define a customer as a separate and distinct buying entity, such as a company, a government institution, a franchisor, a service provider or agency or a distinct business unit of a large corporation that has an active contract directly with us. No single customer accounted for more than 10% of our revenue for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Customer Support
Our customer support group responds to inquiries about the use of our products. We provide basic customer support as well as premier customer support, which may include services such as priority access to technical resources, faster target response times and other additional support services. As the Yext platform can be used by a number of different roles throughout the organization, for an additional fee, we also offer field user support which includes one-on-one training, review of content based on brand guidelines, and other support services.
Professional Services
We offer professional services to customize our platform for our customers. Our professional services teams comprised of project managers, engineers and design experts offer various services including custom built landing pages and data integrations as well as ongoing maintenance and services.
Sales and Marketing
We sell our platform throughout the world to customers of all sizes, including our enterprise, mid-size, and third-party reseller customers. In transactions with resellers, we are only a party to the transaction with the reseller and are not a party to the reseller’s transaction with its customer. We are also developing programs comprised of technology companies and consultants to promote the Yext platform to their customers.
Our sales organization varies by market within each country and will change over time as we build critical mass and address various verticals within a market. Our quota-carrying sales representatives were approximately 250 at both January 31, 2021 and 2020.
We offer annual and multi-year subscriptions to our platform. Revenue is a function of the number of customers, the number of licenses or capacity purchased by each customer, the package to which each customer subscribes, the price of the package and renewal rates. Our subscriptions are offered in a discrete range of packages, with pricing based on specified feature sets and the number of entities managed on our platform, such as locations, persons and events among others. We refer to these locations, persons, and other entities collectively as “licenses.”
Our packages start with basic access to the Knowledge Graph and successively include access to additional capabilities at a higher cost. During the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021, we offered unbundled products for our enterprise and mid-size customers enabling them to purchase each of our products separately rather than in packages with pricing based on capacity or licenses.
Our marketing efforts are focused on promoting our brand and generating demand for our products. We use a variety of marketing programs across traditional and social channels to target our prospective and current customers. Our primary marketing activities include integrated marketing campaigns, sponsorships of leading industry conferences, and thought leadership such as webinars, whitepapers and blog posts.
Research and Development
Our global research and development organization is responsible for the development, design and testing of our platform as well as APIs that facilitate the integration of our platform with third-party applications. Our research and development team uses and shares the same technology, platform development tools and data across various sites. We have and will continue to invest in our research and development team to enable the release of new products and features multiple times a year.
Intellectual Property
Our intellectual property is an essential element of our business. We rely on a combination of patent, trade secret, trademark, copyright and other intellectual property laws, confidentiality agreements and license agreements to protect our intellectual property rights. We also license certain third-party technology for use in conjunction with our platform.
We believe that our continued success depends on hiring and retaining highly capable and innovative employees, especially as it relates to our engineering base. It is our policy that our employees and independent contractors involved in development are required to sign agreements acknowledging that all inventions, trade secrets, works of authorship, developments and other processes generated by them on our behalf are our property and assigning to us any ownership that they may claim in those works. Despite our precautions, it may be possible for third parties to obtain and use without consent intellectual property that we own or license. Unauthorized use of our intellectual property by third parties, and the expenses incurred in protecting our intellectual property rights, may adversely affect our business.
Patents and Patent Applications
As of January 31, 2021, we had twelve issued U.S. patents, twelve non-provisional and two provisional U.S. patent applications, four international Patent Cooperation Treaty patent applications pending, and nine national stage applications outside of the U.S. The issued patents have expiration dates ranging from 2032 to 2037. Although we actively attempt to utilize patents to protect our technologies, we believe that none of our patents, individually or in the aggregate, are material to our business. We will continue to file and prosecute patent applications when appropriate to attempt to protect our rights in our proprietary technologies. However, there can be no assurance that our patent applications will be approved, that any patents issued will adequately protect our intellectual property, or that such patents will not be challenged by third parties or found by a judicial authority to be invalid or unenforceable.
Trademarks
We rely on registered and unregistered trademarks to protect our brand. As of January 31, 2021, we had 135 trademarks registered globally. “Yext” is a registered trademark in the United States and in certain other countries.
Competition
The market for our platform is new and rapidly evolving, and we face many competitors with a variety of product offerings. Our competition comes from businesses that choose to manage their online, public-facing data in-house using manual, paper and spreadsheet-based systems that corporate personnel employ in a fragmented manner rather than pay for a third-party product or service. In addition, other companies may offer products and services at lower price points than us or that compete with some of the features present in our platform. As we develop our platform, we will introduce products and features that compete in new markets and as a result we will face more established businesses in these markets. For example, in October 2019 we launched Answers, our site search product, which competes with other site search products. As we introduce new features and our existing platform evolves, or as other companies introduce new products and services, we may become subject to additional competition.
We believe that we generally compete favorably with our competitors because of the size and breadth of our integrations and relationships with the applications in our Knowledge Network, the features and performance of our platform, the ease of integration of our platform with the technological infrastructures of our customers and the incremental marketing benefits and return on investment that our various products and features offer to our customers.
Human Capital
We consider our culture and employees to be vital to our success. Yext is committed to providing a safe, productive, discrimination-free and harassment-free work environment. All employees are responsible for compliance with our Code of Conduct and Employee Handbook, which includes our anti-harassment policy. These policies and practices help us foster a workplace environment that promotes inclusion and diversity. We also support seven employee resource groups, or ERGs, that are led and founded by employees with a senior executive sponsor. ERGs provide a community for underrepresented groups and their allies and offer professional development and mentoring opportunities. In the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021, the Company made a greater commitment to diversity and inclusion by hiring a senior diversity and inclusion manager to develop and implement diversity and inclusion strategies to improve our recruitment process, performance management, leadership development, employee engagement and retention.
To attract and retain highly capable and innovative employees, we have developed competitive compensation packages and benefits programs. Our compensation packages include market-competitive pay, an Employee Stock Purchase Plan, healthcare and retirement benefits, paid time off and family leave and flexible work schedules. We also offer broad-based equity awards with multi-year vesting provisions to incentivize and reward our employees for long term corporate performance based on the value of our common stock and promote retention throughout the vesting period. We have invested resources to develop employee talent. Upward, our rotational program, offers analysts early in their careers the opportunity to rotate through three functional areas to gain an understanding not only of how our platform and systems work, but also how our customers interact with our products. In addition, we conduct an annual employee survey to gauge employee engagement and identify areas of focus.
To support our employees in the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021 and to promote their health and safety, we temporarily closed our offices requiring all of our employees globally to work remotely. We invested resources in supporting our employees in a shift to remote work, including offering all employees a stipend for supplemental home office equipment and supplies. We provided two weeks of emergency family leave for employees to take care of a child or parent due to COVID-19 disruptions. To help mitigate the financial impact of COVID-19 on certain employees in our sales organization, we offered to advance a portion of the employee’s target commission during the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021 and modified certain quota targets.
As of January 31, 2021, we had over 1,300 full-time employees, the majority of which are based in our New York headquarters.
Governmental Regulation
We are subject to governmental regulation and other legal obligations, including those related to privacy, data protection and information security. Compliance with such laws and regulations could, individually or in the aggregate, increase our cost of doing business, impact our competitive position relative to our peers, and otherwise have an adverse impact on our operating results. For additional information about the impact of government regulations on our business, see ""Risk Factors-Risks Related to Laws, Regulation and Taxation"" in Part I,","Item 1A. Risk Factors
You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, together with all of the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including our consolidated financial statements and related notes, before making a decision to invest in our common stock. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of, or that we currently believe are not material, may also become important factors that affect our business. If any of the following risks occur, our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects could be materially harmed. In that event, the price of our common stock could decline, and you could lose part or all of your investment.
Risk Factor Summary
This risk factor summary contains a high-level summary of risks associated with our business, but does not address all of the risks that we face. Additional discussion of the risks summarized below, and other risks that we face, may be found immediately following this summary.

•Our platform utilizes open source software, and any failure to comply with the terms of one or more of these open source licenses could negatively affect our business.
•We employ third-party licensed software for use in or with our platform, and the inability to maintain these licenses or errors in the software we license could result in increased costs, or reduced service levels, which could adversely affect our business.
•The reliability of our network and support infrastructure will be critical to our success. Sustained failures or outages could lead to significant costs and service disruptions, which could negatively affect our business, financial results and reputation.
•Real or perceived errors, failures or bugs in our software, or in the software or systems of our third-party application providers and partners, could materially and adversely affect our operating results and growth prospects.
Risks Related to Laws, Regulation and Taxation
•We are subject to governmental regulation and other legal obligations, including those related to privacy, data protection and information security, and our actual or perceived failure to comply with such obligations could harm our business. Compliance with such laws could also impair our efforts to maintain and expand our customer base, and thereby decrease our revenue.
Risks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock and Our Status as a Public Company
•Our quarterly results may fluctuate significantly and may not fully reflect the underlying performance of our business.
•The market price of our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile and may decline. Market volatility may affect the value of an investment in our common stock and could subject us to litigation.
Risks Related to Our Business and Industry
We have a history of losses and may not achieve profitability in the future.
We generated a net loss of $94.7 million, $121.5 million and $74.8 million for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. As of January 31, 2021, we had an accumulated deficit of $517.3 million, reflecting our losses recognized historically on a GAAP basis. We will need to generate and sustain increased revenue levels in future periods to become profitable, and, even if we do, we may not be able to maintain or increase our level of profitability. As a result, we may continue to experience operating losses for the indefinite future. Further, we expect our operating expenses to increase over the next several years as we hire additional personnel, incur additional expenses associated with our new and expanded facilities, expand our distribution channels, develop our technology and new features and face increased compliance costs associated with our growth and entry into new markets and geographies and operations as a public company. If our revenue does not increase to offset these and other potential increases in operating expenses, we may not be profitable in future periods. If we are unable to achieve and sustain profitability, the market price of our common stock may significantly decrease.
The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic have had and are expected to continue to have an adverse effect on our business, operations and financial results as well as the business and operations of our customers and potential customers.
The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted business operations for us and our customers, suppliers, vendors and other parties with whom we do business and such disruptions are expected to continue for an indefinite period of time. In an effort to control the spread of COVID-19, governments and municipalities around the world have instituted restrictive measures, including orders to shelter-in-place, travel restrictions, and mandated business closures. The pandemic and resulting governmental restrictions and regulations have adversely affected businesses, economies, and financial markets globally, leading to an economic downturn, a sharp increase in unemployment and increased market volatility.
As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the operation of our business has been disrupted. We have temporarily closed our offices requiring all employees globally to work remotely. We have restricted non-essential business travel and canceled in-person marketing events, including our annual industry and customer event ONWARD20. While we continue to monitor regional developments relating to the COVID-19 pandemic to inform decisions on office re-openings and lifting of travel restrictions, these efforts may not be successful and may require additional costs. The uncertain duration of these measures have had and may continue to have increasingly negative effects on our sales efforts and revenue growth rates. In addition, our management team has, and will likely continue, to spend time, attention and resources monitoring the COVID-19 pandemic and seeking to manage its effects on our business and workforce.
The COVID-19 pandemic has had and we believe will continue to have a negative impact on our sales activities including our ability to attract, retain and sell additional products and features to our customers. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic some existing and potential customers, in particular among those in industries highly impacted by the pandemic, such as retail and food services as well as certain geographies such as Europe, have and we expect other customers may reduce, suspend or delay technology spending, request to renegotiate contracts to obtain concessions such as extended billing and payment terms, shorten the duration of
contracts or elect not to renew their subscriptions. If additional customers or potential customers take similar actions, our operating results and financial condition may be materially adversely impacted. Because our platform is offered as a subscription-based service and we generally recognize revenue from our customer contracts ratably over the term of the contract, changes in our contracting activity in the near term may not be fully reflected in our results of operations and overall financial performance until future periods.
The COVID-19 pandemic and measures taken to control its spread may adversely affect other aspects of our business as described in this “Risk Factors” section. As a result of the scale of the pandemic and measures taken to control its spread, our financial and operating results have been adversely affected and may differ materially from our historical results, and such adverse results may continue or worsen.
Because we recognize revenue from subscriptions for our platform over the term of the subscription, downturns or upturns in new business may not be immediately reflected in our operating results.
We generally recognize revenue from customers ratably over the terms of their agreements, which are typically one year in length but may be up to three years or longer in length. As a result, most of the revenue we report in each quarter is the result of subscription agreements entered into during previous quarters. Consequently, a decline in new or renewed subscriptions in any one quarter may not be reflected in our revenue results for that quarter. Any such decline, however, will negatively affect our revenue in future quarters. Accordingly, the effect of significant downturns in sales and market acceptance of our products or a decline in our retention rate, including as a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, may not be fully apparent or reflected in our results of operations until future periods. Our subscription model also makes it difficult for us to rapidly increase our revenue through additional sales in any period, as revenue from new customers must be recognized over the applicable subscription term.
Our revenue growth rate in recent periods may not be indicative of our future performance.
We experienced revenue growth rates of 34% from the fiscal year ended January 31, 2018 to the fiscal year ended January 31, 2019, 31% from the fiscal year ended January 31, 2019 to the fiscal year ended January 31, 2020, and 19% from the fiscal year ended January 31, 2020 to the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021. Our historical revenue growth rates are not indicative of future growth, and we may not achieve similar revenue growth rates in future periods. You should not rely on our revenue for any prior quarterly or annual periods as an indication of our future revenue or revenue growth. Our operating results may vary as a result of a number of factors, including our ability to execute on our business strategy, our ability to compete effectively for customers and business partners, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, and other factors that are outside of our control. If we are unable to maintain consistent revenue or revenue growth, our stock price could be volatile, and it could be difficult to achieve or maintain profitability.
We have a limited operating history and our business has evolved, which makes it difficult to predict our future operating results.
We were incorporated in 2006 and originally operated as an advertising services company. Our business has evolved several times since then. For example, we sold our advertising business to IAC/InterActiveCorp in 2012 and over the following years have become a platform that puts businesses in control of their facts online with their official answers in search. Many of the most popular features of our platform have only been launched in the past few years.
As a result of our limited operating history and recent changes to our platform and our sales model, our ability to forecast our future operating results is limited and subject to a number of uncertainties, including our ability to plan for and model our future growth. The dynamic nature of our business and our industry may make it difficult to evaluate our current business and future prospects, and as a result our historical performance should not be considered indicative of our future performance. We have encountered and will encounter risks and uncertainties frequently experienced by growing companies in rapidly changing industries, such as the risks and uncertainties described herein. In addition, the duration and extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business and industry are uncertain and introduce additional uncertainty to our forecasts of future operating results. If our assumptions regarding these risks and uncertainties are incorrect or change due to changes in our industry, or if we do not address these risks successfully, our operating and financial results could differ materially from our expectations and our business could suffer.
We have experienced rapid growth and significant changes to our organization and structure and may not be able to effectively manage such growth.
Our headcount and operations have grown substantially in recent years. We increased the number of our full-time employees from over 450 as of January 31, 2016 to over 1,300 as of January 31, 2021 and have hired several members of our senior management team in recent years.
We believe that our corporate culture has been a critical component of our success. We have invested substantial time and resources in building our team and nurturing our culture. As we expand our business and operate as a public company, we may find it difficult to maintain our corporate culture while managing our personnel growth. Any failure to manage our anticipated growth and organizational changes in a manner that preserves the key aspects of our culture could hurt our chance for future success, including our ability to recruit and retain personnel and effectively focus on and pursue our corporate objectives. Furthermore, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, our corporate culture may be difficult to maintain as all our global offices are temporarily closed and all employees globally work from home.
In addition, to manage the growth of our headcount, customer-base and operations, we will need to continue to improve our information technology infrastructure and our operational, financial and management systems and procedures. We have implemented many of these systems and procedures only recently, and they may not work as we expect or at all. Our anticipated additional headcount and capital investments will increase our costs, which will make it more difficult for us to address any future revenue shortfalls by reducing expenses in the short term. However, to the extent we cannot scale our information technology infrastructure, we will continue to rely on manual processes that are costly, inefficient and subject to error.
Finally, in order to successfully manage our rapid growth, our organizational structure has become more complex. We have added personnel and may need to continue to scale and adapt our operational, financial and management controls, as well as our reporting systems and procedures. The expansion of our systems and infrastructure may require us to commit additional financial, operational and management resources before our revenue increases and without any assurances that our revenue will increase. If we fail to successfully manage our growth, we likely will be unable to successfully execute our business strategy, which could have a negative impact on our business, operating results and financial condition.
Failure to adequately maintain and scale our sales force will impede our growth.
Our revenue growth is substantially reliant on our sales force. Much of our sales process is relationship-driven, which requires a significant sales force. While we plan to maintain and scale our direct sales force, both domestically and internationally, we have historically had difficulty recruiting and retaining a sufficient number of sales personnel. If we are unable to adequately scale our sales force, we will not be able to reach our market potential and execute our business plan.
Identifying and recruiting qualified sales personnel and training them on our products requires significant time, expense and attention. Our financial results will suffer if our efforts to scale and train our direct sales force do not generate a corresponding increase in revenue. We have hired a significant number of direct sales personnel in recent years. If new direct sales personnel are unable to achieve desired productivity levels in a reasonable period of time, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic or if we are unable to retain and develop talented sales personnel, we may not be able to realize the expected benefits of this investment or increase our revenue.
We have expanded and intend to continue to expand our international operations, which exposes us to significant risks.
In 2014, we opened our first office outside the United States, and we intend to continue to expand our operations abroad. Our international expansion has created and will create significant challenges for our management, administrative, operational and financial infrastructure. Operating in international markets requires significant resources and management attention and will subject us to regulatory, economic and political risks in addition to those we already face in the United States. Because of our limited experience with international operations and developing and managing sales in international markets, our international expansion efforts may not be successful.
Some of the specific risks we will face in conducting business internationally that could adversely affect our business include:
•the difficulty of recruiting and managing international operations and the increased operations, travel, infrastructure and legal compliance costs associated with numerous international locations;
•our ability to effectively price our multi-tiered subscriptions in competitive international markets;
•our ability to identify and manage sales partners;
•new and different sources of competition in each country or region;
•potentially greater difficulty collecting accounts receivable and longer payment cycles;
•the need to adapt and localize our products for specific countries, including differences in the location attributes and formats used in each country and differences in languages, for example in the case of our site search product, which relies on natural language processing;
•the need to develop integrations with new third-party applications used by international customers;
•the need to offer customer support in various languages;
•difficulties in understanding and complying with local laws, regulations and customs in foreign jurisdictions;
•compliance with U.S. laws and regulations for foreign operations, including, without limitation, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, the U.K. Bribery Act, import and export control laws, tariffs, trade barriers, economic sanctions and other regulatory or contractual limitations on our ability to sell in certain foreign markets, and the risks and costs of non-compliance;
•compliance with international laws and regulations, including without limitation, those governing privacy, data security and data transfer, such as the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, which may impair our ability to grow our business or offer our service in some locations, may subject us to liability for non-compliance or may require us to change our business practices;
•expanded demands on, and distraction of, senior management;
•difficulties with differing technical and environmental standards, data privacy and telecommunications regulations and certification requirements outside the United States;
•varying levels of internet technology adoption and infrastructure;
•tariffs and other non-tariff barriers, such as quotas and local content rules;
•more limited protection for intellectual property rights in some countries;
•adverse tax consequences;
•fluctuations in currency exchange rates, which could increase the price of our products outside of the United States, increase the expenses of our international operations and expose us to foreign currency exchange rate risk;
•currency control regulations, which might restrict or prohibit our conversion of other currencies into U.S. dollars;
•restrictions on the transfer of funds;
•deterioration of political relations between the United States and other countries;
•natural disasters, pandemics including the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, acts of terrorism and other events beyond our control; and
•political or social unrest or economic instability in a specific country or region in which we operate, which could have an adverse impact on our operations in that location.
Also, our network service provider fees outside of the United States are generally higher than domestic rates, and our gross margin may be affected and may fluctuate as we expand our operations and customer base worldwide.
Our failure to manage any of these risks successfully could harm our international operations, and adversely affect our overall business, operating results and financial condition.
Some of our customers and Knowledge Network application providers also have international operations and are subject to the risks described above. Even if we are able to successfully manage the risks of international operations, our business may be adversely affected if these customers and application providers are not able to successfully manage these risks.
Our growth depends in part on the success of our strategic relationships with existing and prospective Knowledge Network application providers.
We have established strategic relationships with approximately 200 third-party service and application providers that comprise our Knowledge Network, including Amazon Alexa, Apple Maps, Bing, Cortana, Facebook, Google, Google Assistant, Google Maps, Siri, Yelp and many others. These application providers provide us with direct access to update content on their websites and applications. This direct access enables us to control our customers' business listings on the Knowledge Network application providers' websites and applications and to push real-time or nearly real-time updates to those business listings. In order to maintain relationships with application providers, we may need to modify our products or strategies in a way that may be adverse to our business and financial results. Furthermore, if we were to lose access to these applications, either in whole or in part, our Knowledge Network would not be as efficient, accurate or competitive. Our customers may also place a significant value on particular application providers such as Google such that the termination or impairment of our relationship with one or a limited number of application providers could lead to a loss of a significant number of customers.
In order to grow our business, we anticipate that we will need to continue to maintain and potentially expand these relationships. We may be unsuccessful in renegotiating our agreements with these third-party application providers or third-party application providers may insist on fees to access their applications. Additionally, our contracts with these third-party application providers may be canceled after a notice period or may not be renewed, and we could lose access to these resources without having sufficient time to replace them. We believe we will also need to establish new relationships with third-party application providers, including third-party application providers in new geographic markets that we enter, and third-party application providers that may emerge in the future as leading sources of information about businesses for end consumers. Identifying potential third-party application providers, and negotiating and documenting relationships with them, requires significant time and resources. Our competitors may be more effective than we are in providing incentives to application providers to favor their products or services or to prevent or reduce subscriptions to our products. In addition, the acquisition of a competitor by one of our third-party application providers could result in the termination of our relationship with that third-party application provider, which, in turn, could lead to decreased customer subscriptions. If we are unsuccessful in establishing or maintaining our relationships with third-party application providers, our ability to compete in the marketplace or to grow our revenue could be impaired and our operating results could suffer.
We do not have a long history with our pricing models and changes could adversely affect our operating results.
We have limited experience with respect to determining the optimal prices and contract length for our platform. For example, we recently began offering capacity-based pricing for our Pages and Answers products. There is no assurance that this new pricing and distribution model will be successful thus adversely affecting our financial results. Furthermore, as the markets for our features grow, as new competitors introduce new products or services that compete with ours or reduce their prices, or as we enter into new international markets, we may be unable to attract new customers or retain existing customers at the same price. Moreover, large customers, which have historically been the focus of our direct sales efforts, may demand greater price discounts.
As we expand internationally, we also must determine the appropriate price to enable us to compete effectively internationally. In addition, if the mix of features we sell changes, then we may need to, or choose to, revise our pricing. As a result, in the future we may be required to reduce our prices or offer shorter contract durations, which could adversely affect our revenue, gross margin, profitability, financial condition and cash flow.
Our success depends on a fragmented internet environment for finding information, particularly information about businesses.
We believe that our platform offers value to our customers in part because of the difficulty for a customer to update information about their business across many websites and apps, many of which are owned or controlled by different entities and receive information from a variety of sources. Industry consolidation or technological advancements could result in a small number of websites or applications emerging as the predominant sources of information about businesses, thereby creating a less fragmented internet environment for purposes of end consumer searches about businesses. Additionally, we may enter new geographies with less fragmented internet environments. If most end consumers relied on a few websites or applications for this information, or if reliably accurate information across the most used websites and applications were generated from a single source, the need to synchronize information about a business and for our platform could decline significantly. In particular, if larger providers of internet services were able to consolidate or control key websites and apps from which end consumers seek information about businesses, including regarding physical locations, other entities and attributes, our platform may become less necessary or attractive to our customers, and our revenue would suffer accordingly.
Our platform faces competition in the marketplace. If we are unable to compete effectively, our operating results could be adversely affected.
The market for our features is competitive, rapidly evolving and fragmented, and is subject to changing technology and shifting customer needs. Many vendors develop and market products and services that compete to varying extents with our features, and we expect competition in our market to intensify. Moreover, industry consolidation may increase competition. Additionally, new entrants, specifically application providers, that enter our markets through acquisitions or otherwise, would increase competition in our markets significantly. As we develop our platform, we will introduce products and features that compete in new markets and as a result we will face new competitors. For example, in October 2019 we launched Answers, our site search product, which competes with other search products.
We currently face many competitors with a variety of product offerings. These companies have developed, or are developing, products that currently, or in the future are likely to, compete with some or all of our features. Also, a number of potential new competitors, including those with longer operating histories, greater name recognition, more established customer bases or significantly greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources than we do, may decide to create or acquire products that compete with our platform or products or we may develop products that compete with their existing platforms. As a result, our competitors may be able to respond more quickly and effectively than we can to new or changing opportunities, technologies, standards or customer requirements. We could lose customers if our competitors introduce new competitive products, add new features to existing competitive products, acquire competitive products, reduce prices, form strategic alliances with other companies or are acquired by third parties with greater available resources. If our competitors' products, services or technologies become more accepted than our features, if they are successful in bringing their products or services to market earlier than we bring our features to market, or if their products or services are more technologically capable than our features, then our revenue growth could be adversely affected. Certain of our existing and new competitors have or may develop technologies and services that compete with specific products or features in our platform seeking to be best-in-class. To the extent our customers or potential customers choose to work with several of these vendors rather than implement our platform, our revenue growth could be adversely affected. In addition, some of our competitors offer their products and services at a lower price. If we are unable to achieve our target pricing levels, our margins and operating results could be negatively affected.
Business and professional service providers may not widely adopt our platform to manage their information or as an important part of their marketing strategy, which would limit our ability to grow our business.
Our ability to grow our business and increase revenue depends on our success in educating businesses and professional service providers about the potential benefits of our cloud-based platform. Cloud applications for organizing and managing information about a business, particularly for their locations, entities and attributes, have not previously been widely adopted. Concerns about cost, security, reliability and other issues may cause businesses and professional service providers not to adopt our platform. Moreover, businesses and professional service providers who have already invested substantial resources in other marketing strategies and data
management systems or methods may be reluctant to adopt a new approach like ours to supplement or replace existing systems or methods. If businesses and professional service providers do not widely adopt software such as ours, our ability to grow our business will be limited.
If customers do not renew their subscriptions for our platform or if they reduce their subscriptions at the time of renewal, our revenue will decline and our business will suffer.
Our customers have no obligation to renew their subscriptions for our platform after the expiration of their subscription periods. In the normal course of business, some customers have elected not to renew their subscriptions with us. Our customers may seek to renew their subscriptions for fewer features, at renegotiated rates, or for shorter contract lengths, all of which could reduce the amount of the subscription. Our renewal rates may decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including limited customer resources, changes in our pricing and subscription models, customer satisfaction with our platform, the acquisition of our customers by other companies and deteriorating general economic conditions. For example, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic certain customers have reduced their subscriptions, elected not to renew their subscriptions, reduced length of contracts, requested extended billing and payment terms or sought more favorable rates. If our customers do not renew their subscriptions for our platform or decrease the amounts they spend with us, our revenue will decline and our business will suffer. If our renewal rates fall significantly below the expectations of the public market, equity research analysts or investors, the price of our common stock could also be harmed.
If we are unable to attract new customers, our revenue growth could be slower than we expect and our business may be harmed.
To increase our revenue, we must add new customers. If competitors introduce lower cost or differentiated products or services that are perceived to compete with our features, our ability to sell our features based on factors such as pricing, technology and functionality could be impaired. As a result, we may be unable to attract new customers at rates or on terms that would be favorable or comparable to prior periods, which could negatively affect the growth of our revenue. Furthermore, we have canceled in-person customer and industry events including ONWARD, our annual industry and customer event, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. We have also allocated marketing resources to focus on virtual events, virtual lead generation, and tools to help our sales personnel connect virtually with customers and potential customers. These new marketing efforts may not be successful and may not attract as many new customers as our historical customer and industry events, which could harm our future revenue and revenue growth.
If we fail to integrate our platform with a variety of third-party technologies, our platform may become less marketable and less competitive or obsolete and our operating results would be harmed.
Our platform must integrate with a variety of third-party technologies, and we need to continuously modify and enhance our platform to adapt to changes in cloud-enabled hardware, software, networking, mobile, browser and database technologies. Any failure of our platform to operate effectively with future technologies could reduce the demand for our platform, resulting in customer dissatisfaction and harm to our business. If we are unable to respond to these changes in a cost-effective and timely manner, our platform may become less marketable and less competitive or obsolete and our operating results may be negatively affected. In addition, an increasing number of customers are utilizing mobile devices to access the internet and conduct business. If we cannot continue to effectively make our platform available on these mobile devices and offer the information, services and functionality required by enterprises that widely use mobile devices, we may experience difficulty attracting and retaining customers, which could negatively affect our revenue.
If we are unable to successfully develop and market new features, make enhancements to our existing features, or expand our offerings into new markets, our business, results of operations and competitive position may suffer.
The software industry is subject to rapid technological change and evolving standards and practices, as well as changing customer needs, requirements and preferences. Our ability to attract new customers and increase revenue from existing customers depends, in part, on our ability to enhance and improve our existing features, increase adoption and usage of our platform and introduce new products and features, including Yext Answers. We expend significant resources on research and development to enhance our platform and to incorporate additional features, improve functionality or add other enhancements in order to meet our customers' rapidly evolving demands. The success of any enhancements or new features depends on several factors, including timely completion, adequate quality testing, actual performance quality, market-accepted pricing levels and overall market acceptance. We may not be successful in these efforts, which could result in significant expenditures that could impact our revenue or distract management's attention from current offerings.
Increased emphasis on the sale and development of new features could distract us from other parts of the business and the development and sale of our core platform, negatively affecting our overall sales. We have invested and expect to continue to invest in new businesses, products, features, services, and technologies. Such endeavors may involve significant risks and uncertainties, including insufficient revenue from such investments to offset any new liabilities assumed and expenses associated with these new investments, inadequate return of capital on our investments, distraction of management from current operations, failure to adequately develop and enhance existing products and unidentified issues not discovered in our due diligence of such strategies and offerings that could cause us to fail to realize the anticipated benefits of such investments and incur unanticipated liabilities. Because these new strategies and offerings are inherently risky, no assurance can be given that they will be successful.
As we enhance our platform and develop new features, our platform has also become increasingly sophisticated requiring additional technology, sales, customer support and professional services resources. In order for our customers to understand and derive value from these new products and features, we will need to devote additional resources to train our sales personnel and provide higher-quality customer support and professional services. In addition, as our software becomes more complex, we may fail to detect errors, bugs or vulnerabilities.
Even if we are successful in these endeavors, diversifying our platform offerings will bring us more directly into competition with other providers that may be better established or have greater resources than we have. Our new features or enhancements could fail to attain sufficient market acceptance for many reasons, including:
•delays in introducing new, enhanced or modified features;
•failure to accurately predict market demand or end consumer preferences;
•defects, errors or failures in any of our features or our platform;
•introduction of competing products;
•poor business conditions for our customers or poor general macroeconomic conditions;
•changes in legal or regulatory requirements, or increased legal or regulatory scrutiny, adversely affecting our platform;
•failure of our brand promotion activities or negative publicity about the performance or effectiveness of our existing features; and
•disruptions or delays in the availability and delivery of our platform.
There is no assurance that we will successfully identify new opportunities or develop and bring new features to market on a timely basis, or that products and technologies developed by others will not render our platform obsolete or noncompetitive, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results and compromise our ability to generate revenue. If our new features or enhancements do not achieve adequate acceptance in the market, or if our new features do not result in increased sales or subscriptions, our brand and competitive position will be impaired, our anticipated revenue growth may not be achieved and the negative impact on our operating results may be particularly acute because of the upfront technology and development, marketing, advertising and other expenses we may incur in connection with the new feature or enhancement.
If we fail to adapt and respond effectively to rapidly changing technology, evolving industry standards and changing customer needs or requirements, our platform may become less competitive.
Our future success depends on our ability to adapt and be innovative. To attract new customers and increase revenue from existing customers, we need to continue to enhance and improve our offerings to meet customer needs at prices that our customers are willing to pay. Such efforts will require adding new functionality and responding to technological advancements, which will increase our research and development costs. If we are unable to develop new features that address our customers' needs, or to enhance and improve our platform in a timely manner, we may not be able to maintain or increase market acceptance of our platform. Our ability to grow is also subject to the risk of future disruptive technologies. Access and use of our platform is provided via the cloud, which, itself, was disruptive to the previous enterprise software model. If new technologies emerge that are able to deliver software and related applications at lower prices, more efficiently, more conveniently or more securely, such technologies could adversely affect our ability to compete.
If customers do not expand their use of our platform beyond their current subscriptions and licenses, our ability to grow our business and operating results may be adversely affected.
Our ability to grow our business depends in part on our ability to encourage current and future customers to subscribe to our higher priced packages with more extensive features. If we fail to achieve market acceptance of new features, or if a competitor establishes a more widely adopted platform, our revenue and operating results will be harmed. In addition, customers may initially purchase licenses for only a portion of the locations or entities that comprise their business. If these customers do not expand the number of licenses managed with our platform, our revenue and operating results will be harmed.
Because our platform is sold to enterprises that often have complex operating environments, we may encounter long and unpredictable sales cycles, which could adversely affect our operating results in any given period.
Our ability to increase revenue and achieve profitability depends, in large part, on widespread acceptance of our platform by enterprises. As we target our sales efforts at these customers, we face greater costs, longer sales cycles and less predictability in completing some of our sales. As a result of the variability and length of the sales cycle, we have only a limited ability to forecast the timing of sales. A delay in or failure to complete sales could harm our business and financial results, and could cause our financial results to vary from period to period. Our sales cycle varies widely, reflecting differences in potential customers' decision-making
processes, procurement requirements and budget cycles, and is subject to significant risks over which we have little or no control, including:
•customers' budgetary constraints and priorities;
•the timing of customers' budget cycles;
•the need by some customers for lengthy evaluations prior to purchasing products; and
•the length and timing of customers' approval processes.
Our typical direct sales cycles for more substantial enterprise customers can often be long, and we expect that this lengthy sales cycle may continue or could even increase. In the large enterprise market, the customer’s decision to use our platform may be an enterprise-wide decision or may require the approval of senior management, which may not only lengthen the sales cycle but also reduce the likelihood of completing a sale. The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted the operations of our customers making sales cycles more complex. Delayed and more complex sales cycles could cause our operating results and financial condition to suffer in a given period. If we cannot adequately scale our direct sales force, we will experience further delays in signing new customers, which could slow our revenue growth.
A portion of our revenue is dependent on a few customers.
For the fiscal years ended January 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, the aggregate of our top five customers accounted for approximately 9%, 11% and 14%, respectively, of our revenue. We anticipate that sales of our platform to a relatively small number of customers will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenue in future periods. If we were to lose any of our significant customers, our revenue could decline and our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. These negative effects could be exacerbated by customer consolidation, changes in technologies or solutions used by customers, changes in demand for our features, selection of suppliers other than us, customer bankruptcies or customer departures from their respective industries, pricing competition or deviation from marketing and sales methods away from physical location retailing, any one of which may result in even fewer customers accounting for a high percentage of our revenue and reduced demand from any single significant customer.
In addition, some of our customers have used, and may in the future use, the size and relative importance of their purchases to our business to require that we enter into agreements with more favorable terms than we would otherwise agree to, to obtain price concessions, or to otherwise restrict our business.
A significant portion of our revenue is dependent on third-party reseller customers, the efforts of which we do not control.
Third-party reseller customers comprise a significant portion of our revenue. In transactions with third-party reseller customers, we are only party to the transaction with the reseller and are not a party to the reseller's transaction with its customer, and we do not control the efforts of these resellers. Such resellers may elect not to renew their subscriptions with us or may elect to purchase significantly fewer licenses, which would materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. In addition, our third-party reseller customers, which often sell to small and midsized organizations that can have liquidity and expense limitations, are also susceptible to global economic weakness and uncertainty, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. See also ""-If customers do not renew their subscriptions for our platform or if they reduce their subscriptions at the time of renewal, our revenue will decline and our business will suffer."" Lower demand from certain of our reseller customers has and may continue to result in them not renewing their subscriptions with us, purchasing fewer licenses, attempting to renegotiate contracts to obtain concessions and requesting extended billing and payment terms. Such an adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results would not be fully reflected in our results of operations until future periods. In addition, if third-party reseller customers merge or consolidate with other businesses, declare bankruptcy or depart from their respective industries, our business could be harmed. For example, consolidation among our third-party reseller customers may require us to renegotiate agreements on less favorable terms, including longer payment periods, or may lead to a termination of our agreements with these resellers. We may expend significant resources managing these relationships. Further, in some international markets, we grant certain reseller customers the exclusive right to sell our features. If those reseller customers to whom we have granted exclusive rights elect not to renew their subscriptions or to purchase significantly fewer licenses, then we may be unable to adequately address sales opportunities in that territory. If we are unable to maintain or replace our contractual relationships with our existing reseller customers, efficiently manage our relationships with them or establish new contractual relationships with other third parties, we may fail to retain customers or acquire potential new customers and may experience delays and increased costs in adding or replacing customers that were lost, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.
We previously identified and continue to identify material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. We may fail to remediate the identified material weakness, identify additional material weaknesses in the future or otherwise fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, and as a result, investor confidence in us and the value of our common stock could be materially and adversely affected.
As a public company, we are required to establish and maintain internal control over financial reporting. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or Section 404, requires that we evaluate and determine the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and provide a management report on internal control over financial reporting. Under standards established by the
United States Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, a material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected and corrected on a timely basis.
In connection with the audit of the fiscal year 2019 consolidated financial statements, we and our independent registered public accounting firm identified a material weakness in information technology general controls (""IT General Controls""). The deficiencies in IT General Controls also resulted in a conclusion that manual controls that rely on data produced by and maintained within these affected information technology systems and automated controls within these affected information technology systems across several of our significant classes of transactions were ineffective. Based on the nature of these deficiencies in IT General Controls, we concluded that the two material weaknesses from fiscal years prior to 2019 related to the revenue recognition process and financial close continued to exist as of January 31, 2019. As of January 31, 2020, we determined that these previously identified material weaknesses had been remediated.
Notwithstanding, as of January 31, 2020, we identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting associated with processes to calculate, record and account for sales commissions. While we took steps toward remediating this material weakness in fiscal year 2021, the material weakness related to the sales commission process continued to exist as of January 31, 2021.
We are taking steps to remediate this material weakness. However, we cannot at this time estimate how long it will take to remediate the material weakness, and we may not ever be able to remediate the material weakness. For additional information regarding this material weakness and related remediation activities, see Item 9A. ""Controls and Procedures."" If we are unable to successfully remediate the material weakness and otherwise establish and maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, the reliability of our financial reporting, investor confidence in us and the value of our common stock could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, we may discover other control deficiencies in the future, and we cannot assure you that we will not have a material weakness in future periods.
Additionally, the process of designing, implementing and maintaining internal control over financial reporting required to comply with Section 404 is time consuming, costly and complicated. Effective internal control over financial reporting is necessary for us to provide reliable and timely financial reports and, together with adequate disclosure controls and procedures, are designed to reasonably detect and prevent fraud. Any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or difficulties encountered in their implementation and maintenance could cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. Undetected material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting could lead to financial statement restatements and require us to incur the expense of remediation. Deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting that are identified in such assessments may be deemed to be material weaknesses or may require prospective or retroactive changes to our financial statements or identify other areas for further attention or improvement.
We may acquire other companies or technologies, which could divert our management's attention, result in additional dilution to our stockholders and otherwise disrupt our operations and adversely affect our operating results.
We have in the past acquired and may in the future seek to acquire or invest in businesses, features or technologies that we believe could complement or expand our platform, enhance our technical capabilities or otherwise offer growth opportunities. The pursuit of potential acquisitions may divert the attention of management and cause us to incur various expenses in identifying, investigating and pursuing suitable acquisitions, whether or not they are consummated.
Although we have previously acquired businesses, we have limited acquisition experience. If we acquire additional businesses, we may not be able to integrate the acquired personnel, operations and technologies successfully or effectively manage the combined business following the acquisition. We also may not achieve the anticipated benefits from the acquired business due to a number of factors, including:
•unanticipated liabilities associated with the acquisition;
•difficulty incorporating acquired technology and rights into our platform and of maintaining quality and security standards consistent with our brand;
•inability to generate sufficient revenue to offset acquisition or investment costs;
•incurrence of acquisition-related costs;
•difficulties and additional expenses associated with supporting legacy products and hosting infrastructure of the acquired business;
•difficulty converting the customers of the acquired business into our customers;
•diversion of our management's attention from other business concerns;
•adverse effects to our existing business relationships as a result of the acquisition;
•potential loss of key employees;
•use of resources that are needed in other parts of our business; and
•use of substantial portions of our available cash to consummate the acquisition.
In addition, a significant portion of the purchase price of companies we acquire may be allocated to acquired goodwill and intangible assets, which must be assessed for impairment at least annually. In the future, if our acquisitions do not yield expected returns, we may be required to take charges to our operating results based on this impairment assessment process, which could adversely affect our results of operations.
Acquisitions could also result in dilutive issuances of equity securities or the incurrence of debt, which could adversely affect our operating results. If an acquired business fails to meet our expectations, our business, operating results and financial condition may suffer.
Natural disasters and other events beyond our control could adversely affect us.
Natural disasters or other catastrophic events may cause damage or disruption to our operations and the global economy, and thus could have a strong negative effect on us. Our business operations are subject to interruption by natural disasters, fire, power shortages, civil unrest, pandemics, acts of terrorism and other events beyond our control. While we maintain crisis management and disaster response plans, natural disasters and other events could also make it difficult or impossible for us to continue operations, and could decrease demand for our platform. For example, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic the operation of our business has been disrupted. We have temporarily closed our offices requiring all of our employees globally to work remotely. Our corporate headquarters is located in New York City, an area that was and continues to be significantly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. We have restricted non-essential business travel and canceled in-person marketing events, including our annual industry and customer event ONWARD. The duration of the business disruption and related financial impact cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. However, a prolonged disruption to our operations may have a material adverse effect on our business reducing operational efficiency and increasing operational costs.
In addition, our data centers are located in New Jersey and Texas and our cloud computing providers operate from facilities in northern Virginia, Frankfurt, Germany and Tokyo, Japan, making our business particularly susceptible to natural disasters and other catastrophic events in those areas. Any natural disaster or other event affecting our data centers could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results.
We depend on our senior management team and the loss of our chief executive officer, president or one or more key employees could adversely affect our business.
Our success depends largely upon the continued services of our key executive officers. In particular, two of our co-founders, Howard Lerman and Brian Distelburger, who serve as our Chief Executive Officer and President, respectively, are critical to our vision, strategic direction, feature innovation, culture and overall business success. We also rely on our leadership team in the areas of research and development, marketing, sales, services and general and administrative functions. From time to time, there may be changes in our executive management team resulting from the hiring or departure of executives, which could disrupt our business. For example during the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021, we announced changes to the leadership team for our sales and research and development functions, and the departure of these key executives may disrupt strategic initiatives of these functions. We do not have employment agreements with our executive officers or other key personnel that require them to continue to work for us for any specified period and, therefore, they could terminate their employment with us at any time. The loss of one or more of our executive officers or key employees could have a serious adverse effect on our business.
The failure to attract and retain additional qualified personnel could prevent us from executing our business strategy.
To execute our business strategy, we must attract and retain highly qualified personnel. In particular, we compete with many other companies for software developers with high levels of experience in designing, developing and managing cloud-based software, as well as for skilled information technology, sales, marketing, legal and accounting professionals, and we may not be successful in attracting and retaining the professionals we need. In the future, we may experience difficulty in hiring and difficulty in retaining highly skilled employees with appropriate qualifications. We face intense competition for qualified individuals from numerous software and other technology companies. Competition for qualified personnel is particularly intense in the New York area. We may incur significant costs to attract and retain qualified personnel, and we may lose new employees to our competitors or other technology companies before we capitalize the benefit of our investment in recruiting and training them. We also employ a number of foreign nationals on work visas, primarily under the H-1B visa. Current and future restrictions on the availability of visas or delays in the issuance of visas could impair our ability to employ skilled professionals, which could have an adverse effect on our business.
In addition, in making employment decisions, particularly in the software industry, job candidates often consider the value of the stock options or other equity incentives they are to receive in connection with their employment. If the price of our stock declines, or experiences significant volatility, our ability to attract or retain key employees will be adversely affected. Also, as employee options vest, we may have difficulty retaining key employees or may be required to grant larger equity awards from our equity plans, which would cause dilution. If we fail to attract new personnel or fail to retain and motivate our current personnel, our growth prospects could be severely harmed.
If we fail to provide high-quality customer support and professional services, our business and reputation may suffer.
High-quality customer support and professional services are important for the successful retention of existing customers. Providing support and services, including education, training, data cleansing and processing, ongoing support as well as custom development services, requires that our personnel have specific knowledge and expertise of our platform, making it more difficult for us to hire qualified personnel and to scale up these operations. The importance of high-quality customer support and professional services and the difficulty of hiring qualified personnel will increase as we expand our business and pursue new customers and as our platform becomes more complex with the development more features and capabilities. If we do not provide effective and timely ongoing customer support and professional services, our ability to sell additional features to, or to retain, existing customers may suffer, and our reputation with existing or potential customers may be harmed.
In addition, certain aspects of our customer support, for example data cleansing, are conducted manually and are subject to error. While there are processes designed to verify the accuracy of data, if information is not updated or matched correctly, our reputation may be harmed and we may be subject to liability.
If we fail to continue to develop our brand, our business may suffer.
We believe that continuing to develop and maintain awareness of our brand is critical to achieving widespread acceptance of our platform and is an important element in attracting and retaining customers. Efforts to build our brand may involve significant expense and may not generate customer awareness or increase revenue at all, or in an amount sufficient to offset expenses we incur in building our brand. In addition, we sell our features to companies in a number of industries, including healthcare, retail and financial services. If we are not successful in building our brand, we may become identified with a single industry, which could make it more difficult for us to penetrate other industries.
Promotion and enhancement of our brand will depend largely on our success in being able to provide high quality, reliable and cost-effective features. If customers do not perceive our platform as meeting their needs, or if we fail to market our platform effectively, we will likely be unsuccessful in creating the brand awareness that is critical for broad customer adoption of our platform.
Adverse economic conditions or reduced technology spending may adversely impact our business.
Our business depends on the overall demand for technology and on the economic performance of our current and prospective customers. In general, worldwide economic conditions may remain unstable, and these conditions would make it difficult for our customers, prospective customers and us to forecast and plan future business activities accurately, and they could cause our customers or prospective customers to reevaluate their decision to purchase our features. Weak global economic conditions, or a reduction in technology spending even if economic conditions stabilize, could adversely impact our business and results of operations in a number of ways, including longer sales cycles, lower prices for our platform, fewer subscriptions and lower or no growth. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting governmental restrictions and regulations have created additional uncertainty in the global economy and a sharp increase in unemployment. The prolonged uncertainty and weak economic conditions relating to the COVID-19 pandemic has led certain of our customers and potential customers to decrease the rate of their information technology spending, has adversely affected their ability or willingness to purchase our platform and has caused them to delay purchasing decisions or reduce the value or duration of their subscriptions, all of which adversely affected our operating results.
In addition, the economies of countries in Europe have been experiencing weakness associated with high sovereign debt levels, weakness in the banking sector and uncertainty over the future of the European Union, including uncertainty regarding Brexit. We have operations, as well as current and potential new customers, throughout Europe. The European Union's economy also suffered a sharp downturn due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and economic conditions in Europe and other key markets for our platform remain weak. As a result, we have experienced negative impacts on our sales activities in Europe. If such conditions deteriorate further, customers may delay or reduce their information technology spending. In addition, the legal, regulatory and economic impacts of the United Kingdom’s exit from the European Union in January 2020 are not fully known at this time. While the United Kingdom and the European Union have signed a EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement, there are still many uncertainties and regulations applicable during the transition period will likely be amended and may diverge from European Union regulations. The outcome of these events may, among other things, increase the costs and complexity of our operations in Europe including our ability to hire and retain employees.
Our reported financial results may be adversely affected by changes in accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
Generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, or U.S. GAAP, are subject to interpretation by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, the SEC, and various bodies formed to promulgate and interpret appropriate accounting principles. A change in these principles or interpretations could have a significant effect on our reported financial results and could affect the reporting of transactions completed before the announcement of a change.
Our estimates of market opportunity, market size and forecasts of market growth may prove to be inaccurate, and even if the market in which we compete achieves our forecasted growth, our business could fail to grow at similar rates, if at all.
Market opportunity and size estimates and growth forecasts are subject to significant uncertainty and are based on assumptions and estimates that may not prove to be accurate. We had historically analyzed the size of our estimated total addressable market, solely with respect to locations, using data published by third parties as well as internally generated data and assumptions regarding our ability to generate revenue from those locations. We have not independently verified the estimate of locations published by third parties and cannot assure you of its accuracy or completeness. In addition, our estimated market size for location-related data was based on an assumed annual revenue per location.
As we continue to develop new features, the methodology and assumptions used to estimate new market opportunities may differ materially from methodologies and assumptions previously used to estimate total addressable market with respect to locations. With the addition of new products and features including our search product, we are targeting and positioning our platform towards new markets. To estimate the size of these new markets and their growth rates, we have relied on historical estimates and forecasts provided by industry publications and other third-party sources, including Gartner. We have not independently verified these estimates published by third parties and cannot assure you of their accuracy or completeness. The target markets in which we operate are also subject to a high degree of uncertainty and risk. Our customers as well as analysts, market participants, and others may disagree with our assessment of our target markets and we may never successfully compete in these markets. In addition, third parties may have different assessments of the size of the markets in which in our products compete.
These estimates of total addressable market and growth forecasts are subject to significant uncertainty, are based on assumptions and estimates that may not prove to be accurate. In addition, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, our total addressable market may be more difficult to estimate and subject to greater uncertainty as the assumptions and forecasts on which we and third-parties have based estimates may not reflect future trends. Even if the market in which we compete meets the size estimates and growth we forecast, our business could fail to grow at similar rates, if at all.
Our management team has limited experience managing a public company.
Our chief executive officer has limited experience managing a public company, interacting with public company investors and complying with the increasingly complex laws pertaining to public companies. While our chief financial officer and certain other executives have such experience, our management team, as a whole, may not successfully or efficiently manage the ongoing transition to being a public company subject to significant regulatory oversight and reporting obligations under the federal securities laws and the continuous scrutiny of securities analysts and investors. These new obligations and constituents will require significant attention from our senior management, particularly from our chief executive officer, and could divert their attention away from the day-to-day management of our business, which could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.
We are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates.
We face exposure to movements in currency exchange rates, which may cause our revenue and operating results to differ materially from expectations. Our operating results could be negatively affected depending on the amount of expense and intercompany transactions including loans denominated in foreign currencies. As exchange rates vary, revenue, cost of revenue, operating expenses and other operating results, when re-measured, may differ materially from expectations. For example, a significant portion of our international revenue is derived from Europe including the United Kingdom. Our revenues and cash flows from these regions may be adversely affected as a result of weakness in the Euro or British Pound. In addition, our operating results are subject to fluctuation if our mix of U.S. and foreign currency denominated transactions and expenses changes in the future. Although in the future we may apply certain strategies to mitigate foreign currency risk, these strategies might not eliminate our exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations and would involve costs and risks of their own, such as ongoing management time and expertise, external costs to implement the strategies and potential accounting implications. Additionally, as we anticipate growing our business further outside of the United States, the effects of movements in currency exchange rates will increase as our transaction volume outside of the United States increases.
Our new credit facility contains restrictive covenants that may limit our operating flexibility.
On March 11, 2020, we replaced our existing revolving credit facility by entering into a new credit facility. Our new credit facility contains restrictive covenants that limit our ability to transfer or dispose of assets, merge with other companies or consummate certain changes of control, acquire other companies, pay dividends, incur additional indebtedness and liens and enter into new businesses. We therefore may not be able to engage in any of the foregoing transactions unless we obtain the consent of the lender or terminate the new credit facility, which may limit our operating flexibility. In addition, our new credit facility is secured by all of our assets and requires us to satisfy certain financial covenants. There is no guarantee that we will be able to generate sufficient cash flow or sales to meet these financial covenants or pay the principal and interest on any such debt. Furthermore, there is no guarantee that future working capital, borrowings or equity financing will be available to repay or refinance any such debt. Any inability to make scheduled payments or meet the financial covenants on our new credit facility would adversely affect our business.
Loans under our new credit facility bear interest, at our option, at an annual rate based on LIBOR (or any such successor benchmark rate) or a base rate. It is unclear whether LIBOR will continue to exist after 2021 and it is not possible to predict the effect
of any changes to LIBOR, any phase out of LIBOR or any establishment of any successor benchmark rates on our new credit facility or our business generally. As a result, our interest costs could increase and our access to capital could change, which could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows.
We may require additional capital to support our business, and this capital might not be available on acceptable terms, if at all.
We intend to continue to make investments to support our business and may require additional funds. In particular, we may seek additional funds to develop new features and enhance our existing features, expand our operations, including our sales and marketing organizations and our presence outside of the United States, expand office space including into new facilities, improve our infrastructure or acquire complementary businesses, technologies, services, features and other assets. Accordingly, we may need to engage in equity or debt financings to secure additional funds. If we raise additional funds through future issuances of equity or convertible debt securities, our stockholders could suffer significant dilution, and any new equity securities we issue could have rights, preferences and privileges superior to those of holders of our common stock. Any debt financing that we may secure in the future could involve restrictive covenants relating to our capital raising activities and other financial and operational matters, which may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital and to pursue business opportunities. We may not be able to obtain additional financing on terms favorable to us, if at all. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us when we require it, our ability to continue to support our business growth, scale our infrastructure, develop feature enhancements and respond to business challenges could be significantly impaired, and our business, operating results and financial condition may be adversely affected.
Risks Related to Information Technology, Intellectual Property, and Data Security
A security breach, network attack or information security incident could delay or interrupt service to our customers, result in the unauthorized access to, or use, modification or publishing of customer content or other information, harm our reputation or subject us to significant liability.
We are vulnerable to computer viruses, break-ins, phishing attacks, attempts to overload our servers with denial-of-service or other attacks and similar disruptions from unauthorized use of our computer systems. Any such attack, or any information security incident from any other source affecting us or our services providers, including through employee error or misconduct or additional vulnerabilities introduced by remote work arrangements, could lead to interruptions, delays, website or application shutdowns, loss of data or unauthorized access to, or use or acquisition of, personal information, confidential information or other data that we or our services providers process or maintain.
For example, in December 2015, we suffered a denial-of-service attack, which resulted in the inability for some of our customers to access our platform for several hours. If we experience additional compromises to our security that result in performance or availability problems, the complete shutdown of our platform or the loss of, or unauthorized access to, personal information or other types of confidential information, our customers or application providers may assert claims against us for credits, refunds or other damages, and may lose trust and confidence in our platform. Additionally, security breaches or other unauthorized access to, or use or acquisition of, personal information or other types of confidential information that we or our services providers maintain, could result in claims against us for identity theft or other similar fraud claims, breach of contract or indemnity, governmental enforcement actions, litigation, fines and penalties or adverse publicity, and could cause our customers and partners to lose trust in us, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business, reputation, operating results and financial condition. Our existing insurance coverage may not continue to be available on acceptable terms or may not be available in sufficient amounts to cover one or more large claims related to a security breach. An insurer may also deny coverage as to a future claim. The successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceed available insurance coverage, or the occurrence of changes in our insurance policies could have a material adverse effect on our business. We could also be required to incur significant costs for remediation or expend significant capital and other resources to address a security breach. The techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service or sabotage systems change frequently, often are not recognized until launched against a target and may originate from less regulated countries, we may be unable to proactively address these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures.
In addition, customers' and application providers' accounts and listing pages hosted on our platform could be accessed by unauthorized persons for the purpose of placing illegal, abusive or otherwise unauthorized content on their respective websites and applications. If an unauthorized person obtained access to a customer's account or our platform, such person could update the customer's business information with abusive content or create and disseminate false responses to reviews. This type of unauthorized activity could negatively affect our ability to attract new customers and application providers, deter current customers and application providers from using our platform, subject us to third-party lawsuits, regulatory fines, indemnification requests or additional liability under customer contracts, or other action or liability, any of which could materially harm our business, operating results and financial condition.
Assertions by third parties of infringement or other violations by us of their intellectual property rights could result in significant costs and harm our business and operating results.
Patent and other intellectual property disputes are common in our industry. Some companies, including some of our competitors, own large numbers of patents, copyrights and trademarks, which they may use to assert claims against us. In addition, because patent applications can take years to issue and are often afforded confidentiality for some period of time, there may currently be pending applications, unknown to us, that later result in issued patents that could cover one or more of our features.
Third parties may in the future assert claims of infringement, misappropriation or other violations of intellectual property rights against us. If asserted, we cannot assure you that an infringement claim will be successfully defended. Certain third parties have substantially greater resources than we have and may be able to sustain the costs of intellectual property litigation for longer periods of time than we can. A successful claim against us could require that we pay substantial damages or ongoing royalty payments, prevent us from offering our platform, or require that we comply with other unfavorable terms. We may also be obligated to indemnify our customers or business partners or pay substantial settlement costs, including royalty payments, in connection with any such claim or litigation and to obtain licenses, modify applications or refund fees, which could be costly. Even if we were to prevail in such a dispute, any litigation regarding our intellectual property could be costly and time-consuming and divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations.
We could incur substantial costs in protecting or defending our intellectual property rights, and any failure to protect our intellectual property could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
Our success depends, in part, on our ability to protect our proprietary methods and technologies. There can be no assurance that the particular forms of intellectual property protection that we seek, including business decisions about when to file trademark applications and patent applications, will be adequate to protect our business. We intend to continue to file and prosecute patent applications when appropriate to attempt to protect our rights in our proprietary technologies. However, there can be no assurance that our patent applications will be approved, that any patents issued will adequately protect our intellectual property, that the scope of the claims in our issued patents will be sufficient or have the coverage originally sought, that our issued patents will provide us with any competitive advantages, or that such patents will not be challenged by third parties or found by a judicial authority to be invalid or unenforceable.
We could be required to spend significant resources to monitor and protect our intellectual property rights. Litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights, determine the validity and scope of our proprietary rights or those of others, or defend against claims of infringement or invalidity. Such litigation may fail, and even if successful, could be costly, time-consuming and distracting to management and could result in a diversion of significant resources. Our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights may be met with defenses, counterclaims and countersuits attacking the validity and enforceability of our intellectual property rights or alleging that we infringe the counterclaimant's own intellectual property. An adverse determination of any litigation or defense proceedings could put our intellectual property at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and could put our related pending patent applications at risk of not being issued. Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential or sensitive information could be compromised by disclosure in the event of litigation. During the course of litigation there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments. If securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a substantial adverse effect on the price of our common stock.
Any of our patents, copyrights, trademarks or other intellectual property rights could be challenged by others or invalidated through administrative processes or litigation. Furthermore, there can be no guarantee that others will not independently develop similar products, duplicate any of our products or design around our patents.
We also rely, in part, on confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, advisors, customers and others in our efforts to protect our proprietary technology, processes and methods. These agreements may not effectively prevent disclosure of our confidential information, and it may be possible for unauthorized parties to copy our software or other proprietary technology or information, or to develop similar software independently without our having an adequate remedy for unauthorized use or disclosure of our confidential information. In addition, others may independently discover our trade secrets and proprietary information, and in these cases, we would not be able to assert any trade secret rights against those parties. Costly and time-consuming litigation could be necessary to enforce and determine the scope of our proprietary rights, and failure to obtain or maintain trade secret protection could adversely affect our competitive business position.
In addition, the laws of some countries do not protect intellectual property and other proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. To the extent we expand our international activities, our exposure to unauthorized copying, transfer and use of our proprietary technology or information may increase. For example, many foreign countries have compulsory licensing laws under which a patent owner must grant licenses to third parties. In addition, many countries limit the enforceability of patents against third parties, including government agencies or government contractors. In these countries, patents may provide limited or no benefit. Proceedings to enforce our patent rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial costs and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business. Accordingly, our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights in such countries may be
inadequate. In addition, changes in the law and legal decisions by courts in the United States and foreign countries may affect our ability to obtain adequate protection for our technology and the enforcement of intellectual property.
We cannot be certain that our means of protecting our intellectual property and proprietary rights will be adequate or that our competitors will not independently develop similar technology. If we fail to meaningfully protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights, our business, operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected.
Our platform utilizes open source software, and any failure to comply with the terms of one or more of these open source licenses could negatively affect our business.
Our platform utilizes software governed by open source licenses. The terms of various open source licenses have not been interpreted by United States courts, and there is a risk that such licenses could be construed in a manner that imposes unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to market our platform. By the terms of certain open source licenses, we could be required to release the source code of our proprietary software, and to make our proprietary software available under open source licenses, if we combine our proprietary software with open source software in a specified manner. In the event that portions of our proprietary software are determined to be subject to an open source license, we could be required to publicly release the affected portions of our source code, or to re-engineer all or a portion of software, each of which could reduce or eliminate the value of our platform. In addition to risks related to license requirements, usage of open source software can lead to greater risks than use of third-party commercial software, as open source licensors generally do not provide warranties or controls on the origin of the software. Many of the risks associated with usage of open source software cannot be eliminated and could negatively affect our business.
We employ third-party licensed software for use in or with our platform, and the inability to maintain these licenses or errors in the software we license could result in increased costs, or reduced service levels, which could adversely affect our business.
Our platform incorporates certain third-party software obtained under licenses from other companies, including companies that sell products that compete with our platform. We anticipate that we will continue to rely on such third-party software and development tools in the future. There is no assurance that we will be able to renew licenses for third-party software that we use. Although we believe that there are commercially reasonable alternatives to the third-party software we currently license, this may not always be the case, or the software we currently license may be difficult or costly to replace. In addition, integration of the software used in our platform with new third-party software may require significant work and require substantial investment of our time and resources. Also, to the extent that our platform depends upon the successful operation of third-party software in conjunction with our software, any undetected errors or defects in this third-party software could prevent the deployment or impair the functionality of our platform, delay new feature introductions, result in a failure of our platform and injure our reputation. Our use of additional or alternative third-party software would require us to enter into license agreements with third parties.
The reliability of our network and support infrastructure will be critical to our success. Sustained failures or outages could lead to significant costs and service disruptions, which could negatively affect our business, financial results and reputation.
Our reputation and ability to attract, retain, and serve our customers and application providers are dependent upon the reliable performance of our platform and our underlying technical and network infrastructure. Our customers access our platform through our website and related technologies. We rely on internal systems and third-party service providers, including data center, cloud computing, bandwidth and telecommunications equipment providers, to maintain the availability of our platform. If any service provider fails to provide sufficient capacity to support our platform, experiences service outages, reduces or suspends service due to a natural disaster or pandemic such as the COVID-19 pandemic, or otherwise ceases to do business, such failure could interrupt our customers' access to our services. For example, we currently serve our customers from third-party data center hosting facilities and cloud computing providers located in the United States, Germany and Japan. Our primary data center is in New Jersey, and our backup data center is in Texas. If these data centers or cloud computing services become unavailable to us without sufficient advance notice, if we are unable to renew our agreements with these providers or if a provider is acquired or ceases business, we would likely experience delays in delivering our platform until we could migrate to an alternate provider. Our disaster recovery program contemplates transitioning our platform to our backup center in the event of a catastrophe and our platform may be unavailable, in whole or in part, during any transition procedure.
We have experienced, and will in the future experience, interruptions, outages and other performance problems. Such disruptions may be due to a variety of factors, including infrastructure changes, human or software errors, capacity constraints due to an overwhelming number of customers and partners accessing our platform simultaneously and inadequate design. In some instances, we may not be able to identify the cause or causes of these performance problems within an acceptable period of time.
If we do not accurately predict our infrastructure requirements, our existing customers may experience performance degradation or service outages, which may subject us to financial penalties, financial liabilities and customer losses. For example, to support the international growth of our business, we have expanded and may need to continue to expand capacity outside the United States, but we may not be able to address future capacity constraints, either through existing or alternative providers, in a cost-effective and timely manner, if at all. When we add capacity, we may move or transfer our data and our customers’ data. Despite precautions taken during this process, any unsuccessful data transfers may impair the delivery of our services, which may damage our business.
Real or perceived errors, failures or bugs in our software, or in the software or systems of our third-party application providers and partners, could materially and adversely affect our operating results and growth prospects.
Our features are highly technical and complex. Our software has previously contained, and may now or in the future contain, undetected errors, bugs, or vulnerabilities. Some errors in our software may only be discovered after the software has been deployed. Any errors, bugs, or vulnerabilities discovered in our software after it has been deployed could result in damage to our reputation, loss of customers, partners or application providers, loss of revenue or liability for damages.
In addition, the proper functioning of our platform is dependent on the ability of our Knowledge Network application providers and partners to maintain the availability and proper functioning of their software integrations with our systems and also is dependent on the ability of our third-party application providers to maintain the availability and proper functioning of their websites and applications on which business listing information is published for customers. For example, a number of our Knowledge Network application providers provide us with an Application Program Interface, or API, on which our ability to interface with that provider is based. Furthermore, in a rapidly changing business environment, for example in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic, our Knowledge Network application providers may experience limitations and delays, which could limit the functionality of our platform. If the functionality of the software, APIs or websites of our third-party application providers is impaired, our customers may attribute such limitations to us and our platform thus damaging our reputation and customer relationships. If our Knowledge Network application providers do not maintain the availability and proper functioning of their software, APIs, websites and applications, our business, operating results and financial condition could be materially affected.
Risks Related to Laws, Regulation and Taxation
We are subject to general litigation that may materially adversely affect us.
From time to time, we may be involved in disputes or regulatory inquiries that arise in the ordinary course of business. We expect that the number and significance of potential disputes may increase as our business expands and our company grows larger. While our agreements with customers limit our liability for damages arising from our platform, we cannot assure you that these contractual provisions will protect us from liability for damages in the event we are sued or a dispute arises. Although we carry general liability insurance coverage, our insurance may not cover all potential claims to which we are exposed or may not be adequate to indemnify us for all liability that may be imposed. Any claims against us, whether meritorious or not, could be time-consuming, result in costly litigation or dispute resolution, require significant amounts of management time, and result in the diversion of significant operational resources. Because litigation is inherently unpredictable, we cannot assure you that the results of any of these actions will not have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results or financial condition.
We are subject to governmental regulation and other legal obligations, including those related to privacy, data protection and information security, and our actual or perceived failure to comply with such obligations could harm our business. Compliance with such laws could also impair our efforts to maintain and expand our customer base, and thereby decrease our revenue.
We receive, store and process personal information and other data from and about customers, including third-party reseller customers, partners and, in limited instances, end users of our services, in addition to our employees and services providers. Also, in connection with future feature offerings, we may receive, store and process additional types of data, including personally identifiable information, related to end consumers. Our handling of data is subject to a variety of laws and regulations, including regulation by various government agencies, such as the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, or FTC, and various state, local and foreign agencies. Our data handling also is subject to contractual obligations and industry standards.
The U.S. federal and various state governments have adopted or proposed limitations on the collection, distribution, use, storage and security of data relating to individuals, including the use of contact information and other data for marketing, advertising and other communications with individuals and businesses. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, or CCPA, became effective January 1, 2020. The CCPA requires covered businesses to, among other things, make new disclosures to consumers about their data collection, use, and sharing practices, and allows consumers to opt out of certain data sharing with third parties. The CCPA also provides a new private cause of action for certain data breaches. The California Privacy Rights Act, or CPRA, which will become effective on January 1, 2023, will significantly modify the CCPA, and also create a new state agency that will be vested with authority to implement and enforce the CCPA and the CPRA. The effects of the CCPA and the CPRA are potentially significant and may require us to incur substantial costs and expenses in an effort to comply and increase our potential exposure to regulatory enforcement and/or litigation. Additionally, the FTC and many state attorneys general are interpreting federal and state consumer protection laws as imposing standards for the online collection, use, dissemination and security of data.
Similarly, several foreign countries and governmental bodies, including the European Union, have laws and regulations dealing with the handling and processing of personal information obtained from their residents, which in certain cases are more restrictive than those in the United States. Laws and regulations in these jurisdictions apply broadly to the collection, use, storage, disclosure and security of various types of data, including data that identifies or may be used to identify an individual, such as names, email addresses and in some jurisdictions, Internet Protocol, or IP, addresses. Within the European Union, legislators have adopted the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, which became effective in May 2018. The GDPR includes more stringent operational requirements for processors and controllers of personal data than previous EU data protection laws and imposes significant penalties for non-
compliance. The United Kingdom has implemented a Data Protection Act that substantially implements the GDPR. However, the United Kingdom’s decision to exit the European Union, known as Brexit, has created uncertainty regarding the regulation of data protection in the United Kingdom in the medium to long term, which may delay or deter transactions with customers that transfer data to and from the United Kingdom. We participate in and have certified under the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield frameworks with respect to our transfer of certain personal data from the European Union and Switzerland to the United States. In July 2020, the European Court of Justice invalidated the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield framework, but concluded that the Standard Contractual Clauses issued by the European Commission for the transfer of personal data are valid. The invalidation of the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield and related uncertainty regarding other data transfer mechanisms could have a significant adverse impact on our ability to process and transfer personal data outside of the European Union, while increasing our compliance costs and legal and regulatory risks. Customers and potential customers may view alternative data transfer mechanisms as being too costly, burdensome or uncertain and therefore impairing our ability to attract and retain customers. In addition, other mechanisms that we use or may use in the future in an effort to legitimize cross-border data transfers may be challenged or invalidated or may evolve such that they do not function as appropriate means for us to transfer certain personal data from the European Union and Switzerland to the United States.
These domestic and foreign laws and regulations relating to privacy and data security are evolving, can be subject to significant change and may result in ever-increasing regulatory and public scrutiny and escalating levels of enforcement and sanctions. Interpretation of certain requirements remains unclear and may evolve, in particular for regulations that have recently been enacted. Application of laws may be inconsistent or may conflict among jurisdictions. In addition, these regulations have increased our compliance costs and may impair our ability to grow our business or offer our service in some locations, may subject us to liability for non-compliance, may require us to modify our data processing and transferring practices and policies and may strain our technical capabilities. In addition as we, our customers and potential customers evaluate the impact of new regulations such as GDPR and as additional requirements pursuant to such regulations are adopted, sales cycles have lengthened and transaction costs have increased as customers conduct additional diligence and contractual obligations under the new regulations are negotiated.
We also handle credit card and other personal information. Due to the sensitive nature of such information, we have implemented policies and procedures in an effort to preserve and protect our data and our customers' data against loss, misuse, corruption, misappropriation caused by systems failures, unauthorized access or misuse. Notwithstanding these policies, we could be subject to liability claims by individuals and customers whose data resides in our databases for the misuse of that information. If we fail to meet appropriate compliance levels, this could negatively impact our ability to utilize credit cards as a method of payment, and/or collect and store credit card information, which could disrupt our business.
We may be subject to rules of the FTC, the Federal Communications Commission, or FCC, and potentially other federal agencies and state laws related to commercial electronic mail and other messages. Compliance with these provisions may limit our ability to send certain types of messages. If we were found to have violated such rules and regulations, we may face enforcement actions by the FTC or FCC or face civil penalties, either of which could adversely affect our business.
As our products are applied to new uses and in new verticals, we may become subject to additional regulations or legal risks. For example, we have begun selling our platform to government entities. Risks associated with sales to government entities include adherence to complex procurement regulations and other government-specific contractual requirements. We may be subject to audits and investigations relating to our government contracts and any violations could result in various civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of contracts, payment of fines, and suspension or debarment from future government business, as well as harm to our reputation and financial results. Sales to government entities can be highly competitive, expensive and time consuming, often requiring significant upfront time and expense without any assurance that we will successfully complete a sale. Our platform has been and increasingly may be used to store confidential or sensitive information, which exposes us to additional risks. For example, in order to offer our products to certain customers in the health care industry we have implemented certain security and privacy measures and related procedures to comply with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, and the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH. This may require us to execute HIPAA business associate agreements, or BAAs, with certain customers that are “covered entities” under HIPAA, which would subject us to additional liabilities, penalties and fines in the event we fail to comply with the terms of such agreements. The storage of such information may require us to modify and enhance our platform at a significant cost.
Any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with laws, regulations, policies, legal or contractual obligations, industry standards, or regulatory guidance relating to privacy or data security, may result in governmental investigations and enforcement actions, litigation, fines and penalties or adverse publicity, and could cause our customers and partners to lose trust in us, which could have an adverse effect on our reputation and business. We expect that there will continue to be new proposed laws, regulations and industry standards relating to privacy, data protection, marketing, consumer communications, information security and local data residency in the United States, the European Union and other jurisdictions, and we cannot determine the impact such future laws, regulations and standards may have on our business. Future laws, regulations, standards and other obligations or any changed interpretation of existing laws or regulations could impair our ability to develop and market new features and maintain and grow our customer base and increase revenue. Future restrictions on the collection, use, sharing or disclosure of data or additional requirements placed upon us, our customers, partners or end consumers in connection with the use and disclosure of such information could require us to incur additional costs or modify our platform or other aspects of our products and services, possibly in a material manner, and
could increase the complexity and cost of developing and deploying new products or limit our ability to develop new products and features altogether. If our policies, procedures, or measures relating to privacy, data protection, marketing, or customer communications fail or are perceived to fail to comply with laws, regulations, policies, legal obligations or industry standards, we may be subject to governmental enforcement actions, litigation, regulatory investigations, fines, penalties and negative publicity and could cause our application providers, customers and partners to lose trust in us, which could materially affect our business, operating results and financial condition. Furthermore, our third-party reseller customers, over which we have more limited control, may not comply with the laws, regulations and policies described above, which may damage our reputation or subject us to costly legal or regulatory inquiries and liability.
We are subject to anti-corruption, anti-bribery, anti-money laundering and similar laws, and non-compliance with such laws can subject us to criminal penalties or significant fines and harm our business and reputation.
We are subject to anti-corruption and anti-bribery and similar laws, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended, or the FCPA, the U.S. domestic bribery statute contained in 18 U.S.C. § 201, the U.S. Travel Act, the USA PATRIOT Act, the U.K. Bribery Act 2010, the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 and possibly other anti-corruption, anti-bribery and anti-money laundering laws in countries in which we conduct activities. Anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws have been enforced aggressively in recent years, are interpreted broadly and prohibit companies and their employees and agents from promising, authorizing, making, offering, soliciting or accepting improper payments or other benefits to or from government officials and others in the private sector. As we increase our international sales and business, particularly in countries with a low score on the Corruptions Perceptions Index by Transparency International, and increase our use of third-party business partners such as sales agents, distributors, resellers, or consultants, our risks under these laws may increase. We can be held liable for the corrupt or other illegal activities of our employees, representatives, contractors, business partners, resellers and agents, even if we do not explicitly authorize, control or have actual knowledge of such activities. While we have policies and procedures in this area, we cannot guarantee that improprieties committed by our employees or third parties will not occur. Noncompliance with these laws could subject us to investigations, sanctions, settlements, prosecution, other enforcement actions, disgorgement of profits, significant fines, damages, other civil and criminal penalties or injunctions, suspension or debarment from contracting with certain persons, the loss of export privileges, whistleblower complaints, reputational harm, adverse media coverage, and other collateral consequences. If any subpoenas or investigations are launched, or governmental or other sanctions are imposed, or if we do not prevail in any possible civil or criminal litigation, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially harmed. In addition, responding to any action will likely result in a materially significant diversion of management's attention and resources and significant defense and compliance costs and other professional fees and may harm our reputation, which may damage our relationships with our customers, strategic partners and other third parties. In certain cases, enforcement authorities may even require us to appoint an independent compliance monitor, which can result in added costs and administrative burdens. Any investigations, actions or sanctions or other previously mentioned harm could have a material negative effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.
We are subject to governmental export and import controls and economic sanctions laws that could impair our ability to compete in international markets and subject us to liability if we are not in full compliance with applicable laws.
Our business activities are subject to various restrictions under U.S. export and import controls and trade and economic sanctions laws, including U.S. customs regulations, the U.S. Commerce Department's Export Administration Regulations and economic and trade sanctions regulations maintained by the U.S. Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control. The U.S. export control laws and U.S. economic sanctions laws include prohibitions on the sale or supply of certain products and services to U.S. embargoed or sanctioned countries, governments, persons and entities and also require authorization for the export of certain encryption items. In addition, various countries regulate the import of certain encryption technology, including through import permitting and licensing requirements, and have enacted laws that could limit our ability to distribute our services or could limit our customers' ability to implement our services in those countries. Although we take precautions to prevent our platform from being provided in violation of such laws, our platform may have been in the past, and could in the future be, provided inadvertently in violation of such laws, despite the precautions we take. If we fail to comply with these laws and regulations, we and certain of our employees could be subject to civil or criminal penalties, including the possible loss of export or import privileges, monetary penalties, and, in extreme cases, imprisonment of responsible employees for knowing and willful violations of these laws. Obtaining the necessary authorizations, including any required license, for a particular transaction may be time-consuming, is not guaranteed, and may result in the delay or loss of sales opportunities. In addition, changes in our platform or changes in applicable export or import regulations may create delays in the introduction and sale of our products in international markets, prevent our customers with international operations from deploying our products or, in some cases, prevent the export or import of our products to certain countries, governments or persons altogether. Any change in export or import regulations, shift in the enforcement or scope of existing regulations, or change in the countries, governments, persons or technologies targeted by such regulations, could also result in decreased use of our products or in our decreased ability to export or sell our products to existing or potential customers with international operations. Any decreased use of our products or limitation on our ability to export or sell our products would likely adversely affect our business. Although we take precautions to prevent transactions with U.S. sanction targets, we could inadvertently provide our platform to persons prohibited by U.S. sanctions. Violations of export and import regulations and economic sanctions could result in negative consequences to us, including government investigations, penalties and reputational harm.
Changes in laws and regulations related to the internet or changes in internet infrastructure itself may diminish the demand for our platform and could adversely affect our business and results of operations.
The future success of our business depends upon the continued use of the internet. Federal, state or foreign government bodies or agencies have in the past adopted, and may in the future adopt, laws or regulations affecting the use of the internet as a commercial medium. In addition, government agencies or private organizations have imposed and may impose additional taxes, fees or other charges for accessing the internet, generally. These laws or charges could limit the use of the internet or decrease the demand for internet-based solutions. In addition, the use of the internet as a business tool could be adversely affected due to delays in the development or adoption of new standards and protocols to handle increased demands of internet activity, security, reliability, cost, ease-of-use, accessibility and quality of service. The performance of the internet and its acceptance as a business tool has been adversely affected by ""viruses"", ""worms"" and similar malicious programs. If the use of the internet is reduced as a result of these or other issues, then demand for our platform could decline, which could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.
Unanticipated changes in our effective tax rate may impact our financial results.
We are subject to income taxes in the United States and various jurisdictions outside of the United States, and we continue to expand our operations internationally. Our effective tax rate could fluctuate due to changes in the mix of earnings and losses in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in non-deductible expenses, expiration or non-utilization of net operating losses, changes in excess tax benefits related to exercises and vesting of stock options and awards compensation, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and our ability to utilize them, the applicability of withholding taxes and changes in accounting principles and tax laws in jurisdictions where we operate. While we regularly evaluate new information that may change our judgment resulting in recognition, derecognition or change in measurement of a tax position taken, there can be no assurance that the final determination of any examinations will not have an adverse effect on our business, operating results or financial condition.
We may have additional tax liabilities, which could harm our business, results of operations or financial condition.
Significant judgments and estimates are required in determining the (provision for) benefit from income taxes and other tax liabilities. We generally conduct our international operations through wholly-owned subsidiaries and report our taxable income based upon our business operations in those jurisdictions. The amount of taxes we pay may depend on the application of the tax laws of various jurisdictions, including the United States, to our business activities, changes in tax rates, new or revised tax laws or interpretations of existing tax laws and policies and our ability to operate our business in a manner consistent with our corporate structure and intercompany arrangements. Our tax liabilities may be impacted if our intercompany transactions, which are required to be computed on an arm's-length basis, are challenged and successfully disputed by the tax authorities. In determining the adequacy of income taxes, we assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes that could result if our tax positions were challenged by the Internal Revenue Service, or IRS, and other tax authorities. The tax authorities in the United States and other countries where we do business may examine our income and other tax returns. The ultimate outcome of these examinations cannot be predicted with certainty. Should the IRS or other tax authorities assess additional taxes as a result of examinations, we may be required to record charges that would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
We may also be subject to additional tax liabilities and penalties due to changes in non-income based taxes resulting from tax examinations in federal, state, city or international jurisdictions, settlements or judicial decisions, changes in taxing jurisdictions’ tax laws and administrative interpretations, or changes in accounting principles. Any resulting increase in our tax obligation or cash taxes paid could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
Adverse tax laws or regulations could be enacted or existing laws could be applied to us or our customers, which could increase our costs and adversely affect our business.
The application of federal, state, local and international tax laws to services provided electronically is evolving. New income, sales, use or other tax laws, statutes, rules, regulations or ordinances could be enacted at any time, possibly with retroactive effect, and could be applied solely or disproportionately to services provided over the internet. These enactments could adversely affect our sales activity due to the inherent cost increase the taxes would represent and ultimately result in a negative impact on our operating results and cash flows.
Existing tax laws, statutes, rules, regulations or ordinances could be interpreted, changed, modified or applied adversely to us, possibly with retroactive effect, which could require us or our customers to pay additional tax amounts, as well as require us or our customers to pay fines or penalties and interest for past amounts. If we are unsuccessful in collecting such taxes from our customers, we could be held liable for such costs.
Certain jurisdictions in which we do not collect sales and use, value added or similar taxes may assert that such taxes are applicable, which has resulted or could result in tax assessments, penalties and interest, to us or our customers for past amounts, and we may be required to collect such taxes in the future. Such tax assessments, penalties and interest, or future requirements may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.
Our ability to use our net operating losses to offset future taxable income may be subject to certain limitations.
As of January 31, 2021, we had significant U.S. federal and state net operating loss carryforwards, or NOLs, due to prior period losses. In general, under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, a corporation that undergoes an ownership change, which is generally defined as a greater than 50-percentage-point cumulative change by value in the equity ownership of certain stockholders over a rolling three-year period, is subject to limitations on its ability to utilize its pre-change NOLs to offset post-change taxable income. Our existing NOLs may be subject to limitations arising from previous ownership changes, and if we undergo an ownership change our ability to utilize NOLs could be further limited by Section 382 of the Code and similar state provisions. Future changes in our stock ownership, some of which may be outside of our control, could result in an ownership change under Section 382 of the Code. Furthermore, our ability to utilize NOLs of companies that we may acquire in the future may be subject to limitations. There is also a risk that due to regulatory changes, such as suspensions on the use of NOLs, or other unforeseen reasons, our existing NOLs could expire, decrease in value or otherwise be unavailable to offset future income tax liabilities.
Risks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock and Our Status as a Public Company
Our quarterly results may fluctuate significantly and may not fully reflect the underlying performance of our business.
Our quarterly results of operations, including the levels of our revenue, gross margin and profitability, as well as our cash flows and unearned revenue balances, may vary significantly in the future, and period-to-period comparisons of our operating results and key metrics may not be meaningful. Accordingly, the results of any one quarter should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance. Our quarterly financial results and metrics may fluctuate as a result of a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control and, as a result, may not fully reflect the underlying performance of our business. These fluctuations may negatively affect the value of our common stock. Factors that may cause fluctuations in our quarterly results include:
•our ability to attract new customers;
•our ability to execute on our business strategy;
•the launch of significant new products and features;
•the addition or loss of large customers, including third-party reseller customers, including through acquisitions or consolidations;
•the timing of recognition of revenue;
•a change in accounting principles;
•the timing of billing and cash collections;
•the timing of significant marketing events and related expenses;
•the amount and timing of operating expenses;
•network outages and security breaches;
•natural disasters, pandemics including the COVID-19 pandemic, acts of terrorism and other events beyond our control;
•general economic, industry and market conditions;
•customer renewal rates;
•pricing changes upon any renewals of customer agreements;
•changes in our pricing policies or those of our competitors;
•the timing and success of new feature introductions by us or our competitors or any other change in the competitive dynamics of our industry, including consolidation among competitors, customers or application providers;
•the timing of expenses related to the development or acquisition of technologies or businesses and potential future charges for impairment of goodwill from acquired companies; and
•unforeseen litigation.
If securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about us, our business or our market, or if they cease publishing research or change their recommendations regarding our stock adversely, or if our actual results differ significantly from our guidance or analysts' expectations, our stock price and trading volume could decline.
The trading market for our common stock depends in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. If few analysts commence coverage of us, cease coverage of us or fail to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our common stock could decrease, which might cause our common stock price and trading volume to decline. In addition,
if one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our common stock or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, the price of our common stock would likely decline.
In addition, from time to time, we may release earnings guidance or other forward-looking statements in our earnings releases, earnings conference calls or otherwise regarding our future performance that represent our management's estimates as of the date of release. Some or all of the assumptions of any future guidance that we furnish may not materialize or may vary significantly from actual future results. Furthermore, the adoption of new accounting standards may require us to modify our earnings guidance, and such modifications though solely attributed to changes in accounting standards, may be perceived unfavorably. Any failure to meet guidance or analysts' expectations could have a material adverse effect on the trading price or trading volume of our common stock.
The market price of our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile and may decline. Market volatility may affect the value of an investment in our common stock and could subject us to litigation.
Technology stocks have historically experienced high levels of volatility. The market price of our common stock has been and may continue to be subject to wide fluctuations in response to many risk factors listed in this section, and others beyond our control, including:
•actual or anticipated fluctuations in our financial condition and operating results;
•changes in projected operational and financial results;
•addition or loss of significant customers;
•addition or loss of significant strategic relationships with application providers in the Knowledge Network;
•changes in laws or regulations applicable to our platform;
•actual or anticipated changes in our growth rate relative to our competitors;
•announcements of technological innovations or new offerings by us or our competitors;
•announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital-raising activities or commitments;
•additions or departures of key personnel;
•changes in our financial guidance or securities analysts' estimates of our financial performance;
•discussion of us or our stock price by the financial press and in online investor communities;
•reaction to our press releases and filings with the SEC;
•changes in accounting principles;
•announcements related to litigation, regulation or disputes;
•fluctuations in the valuation of companies perceived by investors to be comparable to us;
•sales of our common stock by us or our stockholders;
•share price and volume fluctuations attributable to inconsistent trading volume levels of our shares;
•natural disasters, pandemics including the COVID-19 pandemic, acts of terrorism and other events beyond our control; and
•general economic and market conditions.
Furthermore, in recent years, the stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many companies, and technology companies in particular. These fluctuations often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. These broad market and industry fluctuations, as well as general economic, political and market conditions such as recessions, interest rate changes or international currency fluctuations, may negatively impact the market price of our common stock. If the market price of our common stock declines, you may not realize any return on your investment in us and may lose some or all of your investment.
In the past, companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been subject to securities class action litigation. We may be the target of this type of litigation in the future. Securities litigation against us could result in substantial costs and divert our management's attention from other business concerns, which could also harm our business.
Future sales and issuances of our capital stock or rights to purchase capital stock could result in dilution of the percentage ownership of our stockholders and could cause our stock price to decline.
We may issue additional securities. Our certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue up to 500,000,000 shares of common stock and up to 50,000,000 shares of preferred stock. Future sales and issuances of our capital stock or rights to purchase our capital
stock could result in substantial dilution to our existing stockholders. We may sell common stock, convertible securities and other equity securities in one or more transactions at prices and in a manner as we may determine from time to time. If we sell any such securities in subsequent transactions, the ownership of existing stockholders will be diluted, possibly materially. New investors in subsequent transactions could also gain rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of existing holders of our common stock. In addition, substantial blocks of our total outstanding shares are eligible to be sold into the market, although shares held by directors, executive officers and other affiliates are subject to volume limitations under Rule 144 under the Securities Act
The price of our common stock could decline if there are substantial sales of our common stock, particularly sales by our directors, executive officers and significant stockholders, or if there is a large number of shares of our common stock available for sale and the market perceives that sales will occur. We have 123,989,179 shares of our common stock outstanding as of January 31, 2021.
In addition, equity compensation comprises a significant component of our compensation strategy. We have granted and expect to grant equity awards from our equity incentive plan and under the terms of such plan, shares of our common stock reserved for future issuance will be subject to annual increases, which would cause dilution. We have and may in the future file registration statements registering the issuance of shares of common stock subject to outstanding options under our equity incentive plans and the shares reserved for future issuance under our equity incentive plans. Shares registered on the Form S-8 registration statement would be eligible for sale to the public, subject to certain legal limitations. The market price of the shares of our common stock could decline as a result of the sale of a substantial number of our shares of common stock in the public market or the perception in the market that the holders of a large number of shares intend to sell their shares.
Additionally, certain existing holders of our common stock, or their transferees, will have rights, subject to specified conditions, to require us to file one or more registration statements covering their shares or to include their shares in registration statements that we may file for ourselves or other stockholders. If we were to register the resale of these shares, they could be freely sold in the public market. If these additional shares are sold, or if it is perceived that they will be sold, in the public market, the trading price of our common stock could be adversely affected.
We do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future.
We may not declare or pay cash dividends on our capital stock in the near future. We currently intend to retain any future earnings to finance the operation and expansion of our business, and we do not expect to declare or pay any dividends in the foreseeable future. Consequently, stockholders must rely on sales of their common stock after price appreciation as the only way to realize any future gains on their investment.
Delaware law and provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws could make a merger, tender offer or proxy contest difficult, thereby depressing the trading price of our common stock.
Our status as a Delaware corporation may discourage, delay or prevent a change in control, even if a change of control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders. In addition, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that may make the acquisition of our company more difficult, including the following:
•a classified board of directors with three-year staggered terms, which could delay the ability of stockholders to change the membership of a majority of our Board of Directors;
•a prohibition on cumulative voting in the election of our directors;
•the requirement that our directors may only be removed for cause;
•the ability of our Board of Directors to issue shares of preferred stock and to determine the price and other terms of those shares, including preferences and voting rights, without stockholder approval, which could be used to significantly dilute the ownership of a hostile acquirer;
•the right of our Board of Directors to elect a director to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of our Board of Directors or the resignation, death or removal of a director;
•a prohibition on stockholder action by written consent, which forces stockholder action to be taken at an annual or special meeting of our stockholders;
•the requirement that a special meeting of stockholders may be called only by the Board pursuant to a resolution adopted by a majority of the Board, the chairman of the Board of Directors, our chief executive officer, or our president (in the absence of a chief executive officer), which could delay the ability of our stockholders to force consideration of a proposal or to take action, including the removal of directors;
•the requirement for the affirmative vote of holders of at least 66 2/3% of the voting power of all of the then-outstanding shares of our voting stock, voting together as a single class, to amend the provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation relating to the management of our business or our amended and restated bylaws, which may inhibit the ability of an acquirer to affect such amendments to facilitate an unsolicited takeover attempt; and
•advance notice procedures with which stockholders must comply to nominate candidates to our Board of Directors or to propose matters to be acted upon at a stockholders' meeting, which may discourage or deter a potential acquirer from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquirer's own slate of directors or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us.
In addition, as a Delaware corporation, we are subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law. The provisions of Section 203 may prohibit large stockholders, in particular those owning 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock, from merging or combining with us for three years after achieving that ownership threshold. A Delaware corporation may opt out of this provision by express provision in its original certificate of incorporation or by amendment to its certificate of incorporation or bylaws approved by its stockholders. However, we have not opted out of this provision.
These and other provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, amended and restated bylaws and Delaware law could make it more difficult for stockholders or potential acquirers to obtain control of our Board of Directors or initiate actions that are opposed by our then-current Board of Directors, including delaying or impeding a merger, tender offer, or proxy contest involving our company. The existence of these provisions could negatively affect the price of our common stock and limit opportunities for you to realize value in a corporate transaction.
We have incurred and expect to continue to incur significantly increased costs and substantial demands on management time to operate as a public company.
As a public company, we have incurred and expect to continue to incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company. For example, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and are required to comply with the applicable requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, as well as rules and regulations subsequently implemented by the SEC and the New York Stock Exchange, including the establishment and maintenance of effective disclosure and financial controls and changes in corporate governance practices. Furthermore, on January 31, 2019, we no longer qualified as an emerging growth company, and became subject to additional reporting requirements and standards and accelerated filing deadlines for our periodic reports. For example, we have incurred and continue to incur significant expenses and devoted substantial management effort toward ensuring compliance with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. In addition on January 31, 2019, we were required to adopt certain accounting standards including ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), when certain extended transition periods available to emerging growth companies expired. We also became subject to enhanced disclosures obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements and requirements to hold a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation. Compliance with these requirements has increased our legal and financial compliance costs and has made some activities more time consuming and costly. In addition, our management and other personnel devote substantial time to our public company requirements, which diverts attention from operational and other business matters. We have and will continue to hire additional accounting and financial staff with appropriate public company experience and technical accounting knowledge and maintain an internal audit function. We cannot predict or estimate the amount of additional costs we may incur as a result of operating as a public company or the timing of such costs.","Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments
None.","Item 2. Properties
Our worldwide corporate headquarters are located in New York, NY, which comprise approximately 142,500 square feet of office space under a sublease that expire in February 2031. In addition to serving as our corporate headquarters, our New York office also supports our sales, marketing, research and development and other general and administrative functions.
We also have other domestic offices, including Rosslyn, VA and San Francisco, CA, and international offices, including London, UK. All of our facilities are leased. We believe that our existing facilities are adequate for our current needs and that suitable additional or alternative space will be available on commercially reasonable terms if and when it becomes needed.","Item 3. Legal Proceedings
We are not currently a party to any legal proceedings that are material to our business or financial condition. From time to time we may become party to various litigation matters and subject to claims that arise in the ordinary course of business.","Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures
Not applicable.

Dividend Policy
We have never declared or paid any dividends on our capital stock. We anticipate that we will retain any earnings to support operations and to finance the growth and development of our business.

Overview
Yext organizes a business's facts so it can provide official answers to consumer questions starting with the business's own website and then extending across search engines and voice assistants. Our platform lets businesses structure the facts about their brands in a database called the Knowledge Graph. Our platform is built to leverage the structured data stored in the Knowledge Graph to deliver a modern search experience on a business's or organization's own website, as well as across approximately 200 service and application providers, which we refer to as our Knowledge Network and includes Amazon Alexa, Apple Maps, Bing, Cortana, Facebook, Google, Google Assistant, Google Maps, Siri and Yelp. Our platform powers all of our key features, including Listings, Pages, and Answers, along with its other features and capabilities.
We sell our platform throughout the world to customers of all sizes, including our enterprise, mid-size, and third-party reseller customers. In transactions with resellers, we are only party to the transaction with the reseller and are not a party to the reseller's transaction with its customer.
Revenue is a function of the number of customers, the number of licenses with each customer, the package to which each customer subscribes, the price of the package and renewal rates. We offer subscriptions in a discrete range of packages, with pricing based on specified feature sets and the number of licenses managed by the customer as well as on a capacity-basis.
Fiscal Year
Our fiscal year ends on January 31st. References to fiscal 2021, for example, are to the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021.
COVID-19 Update
In March 2020, the World Health Organization (""WHO"") declared the coronavirus disease (""COVID-19"") as a pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted business operations for us and our customers, suppliers, and other parties with whom we do business and such disruptions are expected to continue for an indefinite period of time. In an effort to control the spread of COVID-19, governments and municipalities around the world instituted restrictive measures, including orders to shelter-in-place, travel restrictions, and mandated business closures.
As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we temporarily closed our offices requiring all of our employees globally to work remotely. We restricted non-essential business travel, and canceled in-person marketing events, including our annual industry and customer event, ONWARD20. We continue to monitor regional developments relating to the COVID-19 pandemic to inform decisions on phased office re-openings and lifting of travel restrictions. The uncertain duration of these measures have had and may continue to have negative effects on our sales efforts and revenue growth rates.
Despite the economic challenges brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic, we are committed to our business, the strength of our platform, and our ability to continue to execute on our strategy. During the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021, some business highlights included our collaborations with the WHO and other government agencies to launch comprehensive information hubs powered by Yext Answers, expanding Yext Answers into additional languages, including French, German, Italian, Spanish, and Japanese, and launching Hitchhikers, a comprehensive training program and community for professionals to develop the skills to build custom search solutions for their business using our platform.
We may continue to see some existing and potential customers, in particular customers in industries highly impacted by the pandemic such as retail and food services as well as certain geographies such as Europe, reduce, suspend or delay technology spending, request to renegotiate contracts to obtain concessions such as, extended billing and payment terms; shorten the duration of contracts; or elect not to renew their subscriptions which could materially adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations in future periods. The ultimate extent of the impact of the pandemic will depend on future developments, which continue to be highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including the severity and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and the actions taken to contain and address its impact, among others. However, because we generally recognize revenue from our customer contracts ratably over the term of the contract, changes in our contracting activity in the near term may not be fully reflected in our results of operations and overall financial performance until future periods. See Part I Item 1A “Risk Factors” for further discussion of the possible impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business.
Components of Results of Operations
Revenue
We derive our revenue primarily from subscription and associated support to our Yext platform. Our contracts are typically one year in length, but may be up to three years or longer in length. Revenue is a function of the number of customers, the number of licenses or capacity purchased by each customer, the package to which each customer subscribes, the price of the package and renewal rates. Revenue is generally recognized ratably over the contract term beginning on the commencement date of each contract, which is the date our platform is made available to customers. At the beginning of each subscription term we invoice our customers, typically in annual installments, but also monthly, quarterly, and semi-annually. Amounts that have been invoiced for non-cancelable contracts are recorded in accounts receivable and unearned revenue. Unearned revenue is subsequently recognized as revenue when transfer of control to a customer has occurred.
Cost of Revenue
Cost of revenue consists primarily of employee-related costs, including personnel-related costs, which mainly consist of salaries and wages, and stock-based compensation expense. Cost of revenue also includes fees associated with our Knowledge Network application provider arrangements, the nature of which may be unpaid, fixed, or variable, and are unpaid with many of our larger providers, as well as the costs associated with our data centers. In addition, cost of revenue includes depreciation expense, including with respect to certain capitalized software development costs incurred in connection with additional functionality to our platform. Cost of revenue also includes operating and short-term lease expenses associated with our office spaces, which are allocated based on employee headcount. In addition, cost of revenue includes software expense, which relates to licenses, professional services, and other costs associated with software for use in the operations of our business, which is also allocated based on employee headcount.
Operating Expenses
Sales and marketing expenses. Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of employee-related costs which are comprised of personnel-related costs and stock-based compensation expense. Personnel-related costs mainly consist of salaries and wages and costs of obtaining revenue contracts. Sales and marketing expenses also include operating and short-term lease expenses associated with our office spaces, as well as software expense, each of which are allocated based on employee headcount. In addition, sales and marketing expenses include costs related to advertising and conferences and brand awareness events.
Research and development expenses. Research and development expenses consist primarily of employee-related costs which are comprised of personnel-related costs and stock-based compensation expense. Personnel-related costs mainly consist of salaries and wages. Capitalized software development costs related to additional functionality to our platform are excluded from research and development expenses as they are capitalized as a component of property and equipment, net and depreciated to cost of revenue over the term of their useful life. Research and development expenses also include operating and short-term lease expenses associated with our office spaces, as well as software expense, each of which are allocated based on employee headcount.
General and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses consist primarily of employee-related costs which are comprised of personnel-related costs and stock-based compensation expense for our finance and accounting, human resources, information technology and legal support departments. Personnel-related costs mainly consist of salaries and wages. General and administrative expenses also include operating and short-term lease expenses associated with our office spaces, as well as software expense, each of which are allocated based on employee headcount, and other professional related costs.

Total revenue was $354.7 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021, compared to $298.8 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2020, an increase of $55.8 million or 19%, primarily driven by new customer subscriptions to our platform, and to a lesser extent included expanded subscriptions for existing customers. Our revenue is predominately derived from our enterprise, mid-size, and third-party reseller customers. Revenue from our small business customers represented less than 5% of total revenue for each period. Revenue recognized from subscriptions and associated support to our platform was 93% and 95%, while revenue recognized from professional services was 7% and 5%, for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
Cost of revenue was $86.4 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021, compared to $77.0 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2020, an increase of $9.4 million, or 12%. This overall increase primarily reflects the increases in costs associated with our data centers of $3.2 million, personnel-related costs of $1.6 million, stock-based compensation expense of $1.6 million, and software expense of $1.4 million. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in Knowledge Network application provider costs of $1.0 million as a result of more favorable contract terms with certain providers.
Gross margin was 75.6% for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021, compared to 74.2% for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2020 as reflected in the discussion above.

Sales and marketing expense was $228.4 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021, compared to $218.1 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2020, an increase of $10.3 million, or 5%. The increase was primarily due to a $23.6 million increase in personnel-related costs, reflecting higher headcount, which mainly consisted of salaries and wages and costs to obtain revenue contracts, a $2.8 million increase in software expense, a $1.4 million increase in operating and short-term lease expenses, a $1.3 million increase in depreciation expense, and a $1.2 million increase in stock-based compensation expense. These increases were partially offset by reductions in light of the COVID-19 pandemic and leveraging costs, including a $10.8 million decrease in employee travel and a $7.6 million decrease in conferences and events.
Research and development expense was $58.1 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021, compared to $49.4 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2020, an increase of $8.7 million, or 18%. The increase was primarily due to a $3.9 million increase in stock-based compensation expense, a $3.0 million increase in personnel-related costs, reflecting higher headcount, which mainly consisted of salaries and wages, and a $0.8 million increase in software expense.
General and administrative expense was $76.0 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021, relatively consistent compared to $77.2 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2020, as decreases of $2.1 million in stock-based compensation expense and $2.0 million in employee travel, were generally offset by a $1.3 million increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts and a $0.8 million increase in software expense.

Total revenue was $298.8 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2020, compared to $228.3 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2019, an increase of $70.5 million or 31%. This increase was primarily due to new customers and expanded subscriptions sold to existing customers. Revenue from our enterprise and mid-size customers, which include third-party reseller customers, grew 34% from approximately $213 million to $286 million, and excludes revenue from small business customers, which by their nature have inherently high turnover.
Cost of revenue was $77.0 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2020, compared to $57.4 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2019, an increase of $19.6 million or 34%. This increase was primarily due to employee-related costs reflecting higher headcount, including a $9.0 million increase in personnel-related costs, which mainly consisted of salaries and wages, and a $1.2 million increase stock-based compensation expense. In addition, there was a $2.7 million increase in operating and short-term lease expenses, mainly as a result of our new operating lease arrangements for office space, including in New York, NY, as well as a $2.1 million increase in costs associated with our data centers, and a $1.2 million increase in depreciation expense.
Gross margin was 74.2% for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2020, compared to 74.9% for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2019, a decrease of 70 basis points.

Net Loss
Net loss was $94.7 million, $121.5 million, and $74.8 million for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019.
Non-GAAP Net Loss
In addition to our financial results determined in accordance with GAAP, we believe that non-GAAP net loss is useful in evaluating our operating performance and our business.
Non-GAAP net loss is a financial measure that is not calculated in accordance with GAAP. We define non-GAAP net loss as our GAAP net loss as adjusted to exclude the effects of stock-based compensation expense. We believe non-GAAP net loss provides investors and other users of our financial information consistency and comparability with our past financial performance and facilitates period-to-period comparisons of our results of operations. We also believe non-GAAP net loss is useful in evaluating our operating performance compared to that of other companies in our industry, as it eliminates the effects of stock-based compensation, which may vary for reasons unrelated to overall operating performance.
We use non-GAAP net loss in conjunction with traditional GAAP net loss as part of our overall assessment of our performance, including the preparation of our annual operating budget and quarterly forecasts, and to evaluate the effectiveness of our business strategies. Our definition may differ from the definitions used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. In
addition, other companies may not publish this or similar metrics. Thus, our non-GAAP net loss should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, nor superior to or in isolation from, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.
Non-GAAP net loss may be limited in its usefulness because it does not present the full economic effect of our use of stock-based compensation. We compensate for these limitations by providing a reconciliation of non-GAAP net loss to the most closely related GAAP financial measure. We encourage investors and others to review our financial information in its entirety, not to rely on any single financial measure and to view non-GAAP net loss in conjunction with GAAP net loss.
The following table provides a reconciliation of GAAP net loss to non-GAAP net loss:
Fiscal year ended January 31,
(in thousands) 2021 2020 2019
GAAP net loss $ (94,692) $ (121,544) $ (74,837)

Non-GAAP net loss $ (22,398) $ (53,774) $ (30,604)
Dollar-Based Net Retention Rate
We believe that our ability to retain our customers and expand the revenue they generate for us over time is an important component of our growth strategy and reflects the long term value of our customer relationships. We assess our performance in this respect using a metric we refer to as our dollar-based net retention rate. Our dollar-based net retention rate was 102%, 106%, and 110% for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The decline in the net retention rate in the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021 reflects challenges in expanding our relationships with existing customers and to a lesser extent customer retention. We believe our ability to retain and expand relationships with existing customers, and consequently improve our net retention rate, has been and may continue to be negatively impacted by the effects of COVID-19 on our customers. See ""-Overview - COVID-19 Update"" and ""Risk Factors"" for the impact of COVID-19 on our business.
We calculate this metric for a particular period by first establishing a cohort of the enterprise, mid-size, and third-party reseller customers, who had active contracts at the end of each month of the same period in the prior year. We divide the single month revenue from each of those customer cohorts for the applicable month in the current year by the single month revenue of that same customer cohort for the corresponding month in the prior year. We then determine the dollar-based weighted average of each of the monthly rates, and this average represents the dollar-based net retention rate for the period. As a result, if a customer, in particular an enterprise customer, elects to upgrade, downgrade or cancel its subscription, the full impact on dollar-based net retention rate is realized over the subsequent twelve months, thereby mitigating the immediate effect in the quarter when such election was made. We only consider revenue from our enterprise, mid-size, and third-party reseller customers when calculating this metric since small business customers have limited licenses, experience inherently high turnover, and continue to decline as a percentage of total revenue.
Quarterly Results of Operations
The following tables set forth our unaudited quarterly statements of operations data for each of the eight quarters in the periods ended January 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The information for each of these quarters has been prepared on the same basis as the audited annual consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and, in the opinion of management, includes all adjustments, which consist only of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for the fair presentation of the results of operations for these periods in accordance with GAAP. This data should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. These quarterly operating results are not necessarily indicative of our operating results for a full year or any future period.

Quarterly Trends
Historically, a higher proportion of new subscription and renewal agreements have occurred within the fourth quarter of the fiscal year, which contributes to driving our revenue recognized for the following fiscal year. We believe that this results from the procurement, budgeting, and deployment cycles of many of our customers, particularly our enterprise customers. At the beginning of each subscription term we invoice our customers, typically in annual installments, but also monthly, quarterly, and semi-annually. Amounts that have been invoiced for non-cancelable contracts are recorded in accounts receivable and unearned revenue. As a result, accounts receivable and unearned revenue are seasonally stronger in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year. However, the nature of our subscription agreements generally results in revenue recognition ratably over the contract term, thereby mitigating the effect of potential seasonality in our revenue. Our quarterly revenue has increased sequentially for all periods presented.
Cost of revenue has generally increased over the periods presented, and in recent quarters has stabilized. However, our data center costs have increased and we expect that to continue as we expand our capacity. Our employee-related costs have generally increased, as have our operating and short-term lease expenses as we entered into new arrangements for office space including our transition to our new corporate headquarters in New York, NY. We expect our Knowledge Network application provider costs to generally stabilize, although costs may increase at times as we enter new international markets, or introduce new products and features.
Gross margin has stabilized in recent periods, and may decrease at times as we enter new international markets, or introduce new products and features.
Operating expenses have fluctuated as a result of increased employee-related costs, increased operating and short-term lease expenses as we entered into new arrangements for office space including our transition to our new corporate headquarters in New York, NY, and in more recent quarters increased costs associated with software for use in the operations of our business. Employee travel and conferences and events have decreased in recent quarters in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. Operating expenses as a percentage of revenue have decreased in recent quarters, reflecting impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as strategically leveraging costs.
Our quarterly results may fluctuate due to various factors affecting our performance including impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. The ultimate extent of the impact of the pandemic on our business, financial condition and results of operations will depend on future developments, which continue to be highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including the severity and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and the actions taken to contain and address its impact, among others. However, because we generally recognize revenue from our customer contracts ratably over the term of the contract, changes in our contracting activity in the near term may not
be apparent as a change to our reported revenue until future periods. Most of our expenses are recorded as period costs and thus factors affecting our cost structure may be reflected in our financial results sooner than changes to our revenue.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
As of January 31, 2021, our principal sources of liquidity were cash and cash equivalents of $230.4 million. We believe our existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet our projected operating requirements for at least the next 12 months. Our cash flows, including net cash used in or provided by operating activities, may vary significantly from quarter to quarter, due to the timing of billings, cash collections, lease payments and capital expenditures, significant marketing events and related expenses, the potential effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, among other factors.
Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including those set forth under ""Risk Factors."" We may in the future enter into arrangements to acquire or invest in complementary businesses, services, technologies, and intellectual property rights. In addition, we may be required to seek additional equity or debt financing. In the event that additional financing is required from outside sources, we may not be able to raise it on terms acceptable to us or at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital when desired, our business, operating results and financial condition would be adversely affected.
Common Stock Offering
On March 20, 2019, we closed a common stock offering, in which we issued and sold 7,000,000 shares of common stock, inclusive of the fully exercised underwriters’ option to purchase additional shares. The price per share to the public was $21.50. We received aggregate proceeds of $147.0 million from this offering, net of underwriters’ discounts and commissions, before deducting offering costs of approximately $0.5 million, which were recognized through additional paid in capital.
Credit Arrangements
On March 11, 2020, we entered into a new credit agreement with Silicon Valley Bank (the “Credit Agreement”). No significant debt issuance costs were incurred in association with the Credit Agreement. In January 2021, we amended the Credit Agreement which modified the conditions pursuant to which subsidiaries are required to become guarantors.
The Credit Agreement provides for a senior secured revolving loan facility of up to $50.0 million that matures three years after the effective date, with the right subject to certain conditions to add an incremental revolving loan facility of up to $50.0 million in the aggregate. The three-year revolving loan facility provides for borrowings up to the amount of the facility with sub-limits of up to (i) $30.0 million to be available for the issuance of letters of credit and (ii) $10.0 million to be available for swingline loans.
Under the Credit Agreement, loans bear interest, at our option, at an annual rate based on LIBOR or a base rate. Loans based on LIBOR shall bear interest at a rate between LIBOR plus 2.50% and LIBOR plus 3.00%, depending on our average daily usage of the revolving loan facility. Loans based on the base rate shall bear interest at a rate between the base rate minus 0.50% and the base rate plus 0.00%, depending on our average daily usage of the revolving loan facility. See Part I Item 1A “Risk Factors - Our new credit facility contains restrictive covenants that may limit our operating flexibility"" for discussion of LIBOR being phased out.
The obligations under the Credit Agreement are secured by a lien on substantially all of our tangible and intangible property and by a pledge of all of our equity interests of material direct and indirect domestic subsidiaries and 66% of each class of capital stock of any material first-tier foreign subsidiaries, subject to limited exceptions.
The Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants and restrictions, as well as financial covenants that require us to maintain the year-over-year growth rate of its ordinary course recurring revenue for a trailing four fiscal quarter period above specified rates when certain liquidity thresholds are not met and to maintain a consolidated quick ratio of at least 1.50 to 1.00 tested on a monthly basis.
As of January 31, 2020, we had back-to-back standby letters of credit for $12.1 million, which were fully secured by a $12.1 million cash deposit. The $12.1 million was classified as restricted cash on our consolidated balance sheet. In connection with the Credit Agreement, the $12.1 million cash deposit was released and is no longer classified as restricted cash on our consolidated balance sheet as of January 31, 2021.
As of January 31, 2021, we were in compliance with all debt covenants. As of such date, the $50.0 million revolving loan facility had $35.7 million available and $14.3 million in letters of credit allocated as security in connection with office space.
Cash Flows
The following table summarizes our cash flows:

$ (65,111) $ 39,308 $ 28,134
Net cash provided by financing activities
$ 22,548 $ 168,373 $ 24,384
Operating Activities
Net cash provided by operating activities of $1.2 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021 was primarily due to positive adjustments in reconciling our net loss of $94.7 million to net cash provided by operating activities. These adjustments included stock-based compensation expense of $72.3 million, amortization of operating lease right-of-use assets of $12.2 million, depreciation and amortization expense of $10.6 million, and bad debt expense of $2.5 million, reflecting an increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts in light of impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, there were changes in unearned revenue of $12.7 million, operating lease liabilities of $8.9 million, and costs to obtain revenue contracts of $2.4 million. These increases were partially offset by changes in accounts receivable of $18.0 million, mainly due to timing of billing and cash collections during the period, changes in prepaid expenses and other current assets of $5.5 million, and changes in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities of $2.0 million.
Net cash used in operating activities of $30.8 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2020 was primarily due to the net loss of $121.5 million, as well as changes in accounts receivable of $27.0 million, mainly due to timing of billing and cash collections during the period, and changes in costs to obtain revenue contracts of $18.3 million. This was partially offset by positive reconciling adjustments related to non-cash charges of stock-based compensation expense of $67.8 million, amortization of operating lease right-of-use assets of $11.1 million and depreciation and amortization expense of $8.1 million. In addition, net cash used in operating activities was also partially offset by changes in unearned revenue of $42.3 million and accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities of $8.3 million.
Net cash provided by operating activities of $5.2 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2019 was primarily due to a change in unearned revenue of $47.0 million and non-cash charges related to stock-based compensation expense of $44.2 million, as well as a change in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities of $17.6 million and non-cash charges related to depreciation and amortization expense of $6.8 million. These increases were partially offset by the net loss of $74.8 million, as well as changes in costs to obtain revenue contracts of $16.8 million, accounts receivable of $11.6 million, mainly due to timing of billing and cash collections during the period, and prepaid expenses and other current assets of $6.7 million.
Investing Activities
Net cash used in investing activities of $65.1 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021 reflected capital expenditures primarily associated with our new corporate headquarters in New York, NY, and our office spaces in Rosslyn, VA and Tokyo, Japan, among others.
Net cash provided by investing activities of $39.3 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2020 was due to maturities of marketable securities of $51.2 million, partially offset by capital expenditures of $11.9 million.
Net cash provided by investing activities of $28.1 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2019 was due to maturities of marketable securities of $86.3 million, partially offset by purchases of marketable securities of $52.9 million, and capital expenditures of $5.3 million.
Financing Activities
Net cash provided by financing activities of $22.5 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021 was primarily related to proceeds from exercise of stock options of $16.5 million, and net proceeds from employee stock purchase plan withholdings of $7.0 million, partially offset by payments of deferred financing costs of $0.9 million.
Net cash provided by financing activities of $168.4 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2020 was primarily related to proceeds from our common stock offering of $147.0 million, net of underwriting discounts and commissions, and to a lesser extent proceeds from exercises of stock options of $14.9 million, and $7.3 million of net proceeds from employee stock purchase plan withholdings.
Net cash provided by financing activities of $24.4 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2019 was primarily related to proceeds from exercises of stock options of $18.9 million, and $5.7 million of net proceeds from employee stock purchase plan withholdings.
Contractual Obligations
We are obligated to make payments under certain non-cancelable contractual obligations in the normal course of business. Our contractual obligations primarily relate to our operating lease arrangements for office space. Our other contractual obligations include contracts with our Knowledge Network application providers, which generally have a term of one year, although some have a term of several years, as well as contracts with our software vendors, among others. These obligations represent minimum contractual payments, or our best estimate for variable elements based on historical payments. Our contractual obligations have various expiry dates between fiscal years 2022 and 2035.
As of January 31, 2021, our contractual obligations are as follows (in thousands):
Fiscal year ending January 31: Operating Leases Other
2022 $ 19,490 $ 30,091
2023 19,189 10,332

Total $ 187,685 $ 50,934
See Note 13 ""Commitments and Contingencies"" to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion on contractual obligations.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We do not engage in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, as part of our ongoing business. Accordingly, our operating results, financial condition and cash flows are not subject to off-balance sheet risks.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Our management's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported revenue generated and expenses incurred during the reporting periods. Our estimates are based on our historical experience and various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about items that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
See Note 2 ""Summary of Significant Accounting Policies"" to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion on our accounting policies. Our most critical accounting policies and estimates, based on the degree of judgment and complexity, are discussed below.
Revenue Recognition
We derive our revenue primarily from our subscriptions and associated support to the Yext platform. Our subscriptions do not provide customers with the right to take possession of the software supporting the applications and, as a result, are accounted for as service contracts. Our subscription and associated support performance obligation is distinct because a customer's use of the Yext platform is fully functional upon access, does not require any additional development, modification or customization, and is often sold separately. In certain instances, we enter into a contract that includes a promise to provide certain technical or customized professional services, in addition to a promise to provide its subscription and associated support. Our professional services performance obligation is distinct as it does not significantly change or enhance the functionality of the Yext platform.
In instances when a contract includes more than one performance obligation, we must allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations on a relative standalone selling price basis (""SSP""). SSP represents the price at which a company would sell a promised product or service separately to a customer. We determine the SSP based on a series of complex factors. Our selling prices associated with our subscription and associated support are considered highly variable based on discounting practices, customer geography, customer size, and other such factors. In contrast, our selling prices associated with our professional services are more observable, predictable and consistent. Accordingly, we use the residual method to determine SSP.
The recognition of revenue is determined through application of the five-step model in accordance with ASC 606. Revenue is recognized upon transfer of control of services to our customers, including third-party reseller customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those services. In transactions with resellers, we contract only with the reseller, in which pricing and length of subscription and support services are agreed upon. The reseller negotiates the price charged and length of subscription and support service directly with its customer. We do not pay separate fees to third-party reseller customers in association with these transactions, and do not have direct interactions with the reseller’s customer.
Revenue is generally recognized ratably over the contract term beginning on the commencement date of each contract, which is the date our platform is made available to our customers. Amounts that have been invoiced for non-cancelable contracts are recorded in accounts receivable and unearned revenue or revenue. See to Note 2 ""Summary of Significant Accounting Policies"" and Note 3 ""Revenue"" to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion on our revenue recognition.
Costs Capitalized to Obtain Revenue Contracts
We capitalize costs of obtaining revenue contracts that are incremental and recoverable. Incremental costs primarily include sales commissions, certain related incentives, and associated payroll tax and fringe benefit costs. We amortize such costs on a straight-line basis over the average benefit period, which is typically three years for new contracts and one year for renewals. We determine the average benefit period by considering both qualitative and quantitative factors, which include the estimated life of capitalized software development costs resulting from additional functionality to the Yext platform and estimated customer life, among other such factors. Amortization of costs capitalized to obtain revenue contracts is included in sales and marketing expense in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.
Stock-Based Compensation
Stock-based compensation for all employee and non-employee stock-based awards, including restricted stock units and restricted stock, is measured at fair value on the date of grant and recognized over the service period. The fair value of restricted stock units and restricted stock are calculated based on the fair value of our common stock on the date of grant, while the fair value of stock options are calculated using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model.
Stock-based compensation expense is recognized over the requisite service periods of awards, which is typically one to four years for restricted stock units and restricted stock. The estimated forfeiture rate applied to employee awards is based on historical forfeiture rates. The estimated number of stock-based awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment, and to the extent actual results, or updated estimates, differ from our current estimates, such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period actual results are realized or estimates are revised. A higher forfeiture rate will result in an adjustment that will decrease stock-based compensation expense, whereas a lower forfeiture rate will result in an adjustment that will increase stock-based compensation expense. We do not apply a forfeiture rate assumption to value non-employee awards, given the nature of the services provided.
For our Employee Stock Purchase Plan (""ESPP""), we measure stock-based compensation expense at fair-value using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model, at the commencement of each offering period and recognize the expense over that offering period, which is generally six months. The key assumptions used in the Black-Scholes option-pricing model include a volatility assumption based on the historical volatility of our stock price and the risk-free rate assumption based on the U.S. treasury yield curve in effect at the commencement of the offering period or grant date. The dividend yield assumption is zero as we have not historically paid any dividends and do not expect to declare or pay any dividends in the foreseeable future.
We will continue to use judgment in evaluating the assumptions related to our stock-based compensation. As we continue to accumulate additional data related to our common stock, we may refine our estimates. If factors change and different assumptions are used, the impact to our stock-based compensation expense could be material.
Income Taxes
We account for income taxes in accordance with ASC Topic 740, “Income Taxes,” under which deferred income taxes are provided for temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of our assets and liabilities. We classify all deferred tax assets and liabilities as non-current on the consolidated balance sheet. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized within the (provision for) benefit from income taxes on the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss in the period that includes the enactment date.
We reduce deferred tax assets, if necessary, by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that we will not realize some or all of our deferred tax assets. In making such a determination, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income, tax-planning strategies, and results of recent operations.
We recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. We recognize interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions within the (provision for) benefit from income taxes on our consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss.
Leases
We enter into contracts in the normal course of business and assess whether any such contracts contain a lease. We classify leases as operating or financing in nature, and record the associated lease liability and right-of-use asset on our balance sheet. The lease liability represents the present value of future lease payments, net of lease incentives, discounted using incremental borrowing rates.
For each individual lease arrangement, we estimate an incremental borrowing rate at the commencement date. The incremental borrowing rate is determined based on what we would estimate to pay for a collateralized loan over a similar term and economic environment for each lease arrangement. As of January 31, 2021, a hypothetical 100 basis point change in our estimated incremental borrowing rates for our respective leases would have a less than 10% impact to the aggregated total operating lease liability on the consolidated balance sheet.
With respect to our operating lease arrangements, we account for lease components, and non-lease components that are fixed, as a single lease component in the measurement of operating lease liabilities and right-of-us assets. Non-lease components that are variable are expensed as incurred in the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss. Lease arrangements with an initial term of 12 months or less are recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term and are not recorded on the consolidated balance sheet.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
See Note 2 ""Summary of Significant Accounting Policies"" to the consolidated financial statements for our discussion about adopted and pending recent accounting pronouncements.","Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
Market risk represents the risk of loss that may affect our financial position due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates. We are exposed to market risks related to foreign currency exchange rates, inflation and interest rates.
Foreign Currency Risk
Assets and liabilities of non-U.S. subsidiaries that operate in a local currency environment, where the local currency is the functional currency, are translated from foreign currencies into U.S. dollars using month-end rates of exchange for assets and liabilities, and average rates for the period derived from month-end spot rates for revenue, costs and expenses. We record translation gains and losses in accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income as a component of stockholders' equity. We reflect net foreign exchange transaction gains and losses resulting from the conversion of the transaction currency to functional currency as a component of foreign currency exchange losses in other expense, net. Based on the size of our international operations and the amount of our expenses denominated in foreign currencies, we would not expect a 10% change in the value of the U.S. dollar from rates on January 31, 2021 to have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations. These exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and economic conditions change, including market impacts associated with COVID-19.
Inflation Risk
We do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations, other than its impact on the general economy. Nonetheless, if our costs were to become subject to inflationary pressures, we may not be able to fully offset such higher costs through price increases. Our inability or failure to do so could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Interest Rate Risk
As of January 31, 2021, we had cash and cash equivalents of $230.4 million. The primary objective of our investments is the preservation of capital to fulfill liquidity needs. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes.
We do not believe our cash equivalents have significant risk of default or illiquidity. While we believe our cash equivalents do not contain excessive risk, we cannot assure you that in the future our investments will not be subject to adverse changes in market value. In addition, we maintain significant amounts of cash and cash equivalents at one or more financial institutions that are in excess of federally insured limits and are exposed to counterparty risk. We have not been exposed to, nor do we anticipate being exposed to, material risks due to changes in interest rates. A hypothetical 10% change in interest rates during any of the periods presented would not have had a material impact on our financial statements.","Item 8.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Yext, Inc.
Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Yext, Inc. (the Company) as of January 31, 2021 and 2020, the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss, stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended January 31, 2021, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the ""consolidated financial statements""). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at January 31, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended January 31, 2021, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), and our report dated March 16, 2021 expressed an adverse opinion thereon.
Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matters
The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.
Completeness and Measurement of Costs Capitalized to Obtain Revenue Contracts
Description of the Matter
The Company capitalized $33.2 million of costs to obtain revenue contracts during the year ended January 31, 2021. As described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, capitalized costs are inclusive of sales commissions and any associated payroll taxes or fringe benefit costs that are incremental to obtain the contract with the customer but expected to be recoverable.
Auditing the costs capitalized to obtain contracts with the customers required complex auditor judgment and was especially challenging due to the material weakness identified by the Company and the impact it had on management’s evaluation of completeness and measurement of these costs. The Company has a high volume of sales commission plans with various underlying criteria and inputs used to calculate amounts capitalized to obtain contracts with the customers. The material weakness required an increased extent of audit effort to test the completeness and accuracy of inputs of the commission-eligible revenue contracts and measurement of incremental costs eligible for capitalization.
How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit
We performed audit procedures that included, among others, assessing whether those costs capitalized were eligible costs and met the criteria of incremental and recoverable. For example, we tested a sample of commissions transactions by reviewing and assessing the underlying commission plan and tested the measurement of capitalized costs by recalculating the amount earned based on sales and contract data. We validated that each commission earned and capitalized was an incremental cost to obtain a revenue contract. To respond to the material weakness, we performed incremental audit procedures, for instance, by increasing our sample size related to commission transactions. Our procedures also included reconciling the capitalized commission population to sales commissions paid throughout the year. We performed a retrospective review of commission payments made subsequent to the balance sheet date related to commissions earned in the current fiscal year to test the completeness of costs capitalized.
Revenue Recognition
Description of the Matter
The Company recorded consolidated revenue and unearned revenue of $354.7 million and $192.0 million, respectively, for the year ended January 31, 2021. As described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company primarily earns revenue from subscriptions and associated support to the platform. The Company’s revenue contracts include contractual terms and conditions that can impact the amount allocated to each of its performance obligations and the timing of revenue recognition.
Auditing the timing and measurement of the Company's revenue recognition was especially challenging due to the volume of executed contracts and the assessment of the unique terms. This involved assessing the contractual terms and conditions of both new and modified contracts to determine the contract period, identifying all performance obligations, and determine if the transaction price expected to be received was fixed or variable.
How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit
We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design, and tested the operating effectiveness of the Company’s internal controls over the accounting for revenue. For example, we tested controls over the Company’s processes to evaluate contractual terms and conditions and determine the timing and amount of revenue to be recognized related to the performance obligations identified as services are transferred to the customer. This included testing relevant controls over the IT systems that are important to the initiation, processing and recording of revenue transactions.
We performed audit procedures that included, among others, reading a sample of revenue contracts to evaluate the contractual terms and conditions, identify performance obligations, assess the fixed and variable components to determine the transaction price, and assess the measurement and timing of revenue recognized and unearned revenue recorded as of year-end. We tested the revenue recognized and unearned revenue as of year-end through analytical procedures, including the recalculation of balances on a disaggregated basis. Finally, we assessed the appropriateness of the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Yext, Inc.
Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
We have audited Yext, Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, because of the effect of the material weakness described below on the achievement of the objectives of the control criteria, Yext, Inc. (the Company) has not maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2021, based on the COSO criteria.
A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company’s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. The following material weakness has been identified and included in management’s assessment. Management has identified a material weakness related to the Company’s processes to calculate, record and account for sales commissions.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of Yext, Inc. as of January 31, 2021 and 2020, the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended January 31, 2021, and the related notes. This material weakness was considered in determining the nature, timing and extent of audit tests applied in our audit of the 2021 consolidated financial statements, and this report does not affect our report dated March 16, 2021 which expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
Basis for Opinion
The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (""GAAP"") and applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (""SEC"") regarding financial reporting. The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of those financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expense during the reporting period. These estimates include, but are not limited to, the standalone selling prices (""SSP"") of performance obligations, the incremental borrowing rate associated with lease liabilities, the useful life of capitalized costs to obtain revenue contracts, income taxes, and the valuation and assumptions underlying stock-based compensation. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other market-specific and relevant assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ from those estimates and such differences could be material to the financial position and results of operations.
Segment Information
The Company is the provider of the Yext platform and operates as one operating segment. An operating segment is defined as a component of an enterprise for which separate financial information is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision makers (""CODM""). The Company defines its CODM as its executive officers, and their role is to make decisions about allocating resources and assessing performance. The Company's business operates in one operating segment as all of the Company's offerings operate on the Yext platform and are deployed in an identical way, with its CODM evaluating the Company's financial information, resources and performance of these resources on a consolidated basis. Since the Company operates in one operating segment, all required financial segment information can be found in the consolidated financial statements.
Revenue Recognition
The Company derives its revenue primarily from its subscriptions and associated support to the Yext platform. The Company's subscriptions do not provide customers with the right to take possession of the software supporting the applications and, as a result, are accounted for as service contracts.
The Company adopted on a modified retrospective basis ASU 2014-09 ""Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)"" (""ASU 2014-09"") in its fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended January 31, 2019, the effects of which were recognized effective February 1, 2018. The Company recognizes revenue upon transfer of control of services to its customers in an amount that reflects the consideration it expects to receive in exchange for those services. The recognition of revenue is determined through application of the following five-step model:
•Identification of the contract(s) with customers;
•Identification of the performance obligation(s) in the contract;
•Determination of the transaction price;
•Allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligation(s) in the contract; and
•Recognition of revenue when or as the performance obligation(s) are satisfied
The Company identifies the performance obligations in a contract with a customer and determines whether they are distinct or distinct within the context of the contract. When there is more than one distinct performance obligation in a contract, the Company allocates the transaction price to the performance obligations on a relative standalone selling price basis. The Company estimates the amount of consideration expected to be received in exchange for transferring services if the consideration promised in a contract includes a variable amount.
Revenue is generally recognized ratably over the contract term beginning on the commencement date of each contract, which is the date the Yext platform is made available to customers. Contracts are typically one year in length, but may be up to three years or longer in length. At the beginning of each subscription term the Company invoices its customers, typically in annual installments but also monthly, quarterly, and semi-annually. Amounts that have been invoiced for non-cancelable contracts are recorded in accounts receivable and in unearned revenue or revenue. The Company reports revenue net of sales tax and other taxes collected from customers to be remitted to government authorities.
Costs Capitalized to Obtain Revenue Contracts
The Company capitalizes costs of obtaining revenue contracts that are incremental and recoverable. Incremental costs primarily include sales commissions for new and renewal revenue contracts, certain related incentives, and associated payroll tax and fringe benefit costs. Capitalized amounts are recoverable through future revenue streams under all customer contracts.
Costs capitalized to obtain new revenue contracts are amortized on a straight-line basis over three years, which reflects the average benefit period, and may be longer than the initial contract period. The Company determined the average benefit period having considered both qualitative and quantitative factors, including the estimated life of capitalized software development costs resulting from additional functionality to the Yext platform and estimated customer life, among other such factors. The Company amortizes costs capitalized for contract renewals over the renewal term, reflecting the average benefit period for such renewals, which is typically one year. Amortization of costs capitalized to obtain revenue contracts is included in sales and marketing expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.
The Company periodically evaluates whether there have been any changes in its business, market conditions, or other events which would indicate that its amortization period should be changed, or if there are potential indicators of impairment.
During the fiscal years ended January 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company capitalized $33.2 million and $41.4 million of costs to obtain revenue contracts and amortized $34.6 million and $23.1 million to sales and marketing expense, respectively. Costs capitalized to obtain revenue contracts on the Company's consolidated balance sheet totaled $53.0 million and $54.5 million at January 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. There were no impairments of costs capitalized to obtain revenue contracts for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Cost of Revenue
Cost of revenue is generally expensed as incurred, including personnel-related costs, costs associated with the Company’s Knowledge Network application providers, and data center costs. Capitalized software development costs incurred in connection with additional functionality to the Yext platform are recognized in cost of revenue as depreciation expense in accordance with the “capitalized software development costs” section of this Note. Cost of revenue also includes operating and short-term lease expenses, software expense, and depreciation expense, each of which are allocated based on employee headcount.
Stock-Based Compensation
Stock-based compensation for all employee stock-based awards, including restricted stock units, restricted stock and options to purchase common stock, is measured at fair value on the date of grant and recognized over the service period.
The fair value of restricted stock units and restricted stock are estimated on the date of grant based on the fair value of the Company’s common stock. The fair value of employee stock options is estimated on the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model.
Stock-based compensation expense is recognized over the requisite service periods of awards, which is typically one to four years for restricted stock units and restricted stock and four years for options. The estimated forfeiture rate applied is based on historical forfeiture rates. The estimated number of stock-based awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment, and to the extent actual results, or updated estimates, differ from the Company’s current estimates, such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period actual results are realized or estimates are revised.
Stock-based compensation expense associated with the Company's Employee Stock Purchase Plan (""ESPP"") is measured at fair-value using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model at commencement of each offering period and recognized over that offering period.
The Company prospectively adopted ASU 2018-07 on February 1, 2019. As a result, the Company measures stock-based compensation associated with stock-based awards issued to non-employees at the grant date, based on the estimated fair value of the award, and recognizes expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. The Company does not apply a forfeiture rate assumption to value such awards, given the nature of the services provided. Prior to adoption, during the fiscal year ended January 31,
2019 stock-based compensation associated with stock-based awards issued to non-employees was re-measured each period until fully vested.
Advertising and Other Promotional Costs
Advertising and other promotional costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising expenses were $7.5 million, $6.9 million and $6.1 million for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively and are included within sales and marketing expense in the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss.
Research and Development
Research and development costs are generally expensed as incurred, including personnel-related costs. Research and development costs also include operating and short-term lease expenses and software expense, each of which are allocated based on employee headcount. Research and development costs exclude capitalized software development costs.
Capitalized Software Development Costs
The Company capitalizes certain software development costs included as software in progress or computer software within property and equipment, net. These costs are incurred in connection with additional functionality to its platform, as well as internal-use projects during the application development stage and include elements of stock-based compensation. Computer software is recognized on a straight-line basis over an estimated useful life of 2 to 3 years. Capitalized software development costs incurred in connection with additional functionality to the platform are recognized as depreciation expense in cost of revenue within the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss. Capitalized software development costs incurred in internal-use projects are recognized as depreciation expense and are allocated based on employee headcount. Capitalized software development costs, net were $7.2 million and $4.4 million as of January 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and primarily related to those costs incurred in connection with additional functionality to its platform. Depreciation expense associated with capitalized software development costs was $2.6 million, $2.7 million and $2.2 million during the fiscal years ended January 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Software costs that meet the cloud computing arrangements criteria are capitalized in accordance with ASC 350 “Intangibles-Goodwill and Other” and are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the arrangement, plus reasonably certain renewals. Capitalized costs included in prepaid expenses and other current assets were $2.5 million and $1.2 million as of January 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and $0.8 million and zero were amortized during the fiscal years ended January 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Software costs that do not meet the capitalization criteria, including costs incurred in the maintenance and minor upgrade and enhancement of software without additional functionality, are expensed as incurred.
The Company evaluates the useful lives of these assets on an annual basis and tests for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
Income Taxes
The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with ASC Topic 740, “Income Taxes,” under which deferred income taxes are provided for temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of the Company’s assets and liabilities. The Company classifies all deferred tax assets and liabilities as non-current on the consolidated balance sheet. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized within the (provision for) benefit from income taxes on the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss in the period that includes the enactment date.
The Company reduces deferred tax assets, if necessary, by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that the Company will not realize some or all of the deferred tax assets. In making such a determination, the Company considers all available positive and negative evidence, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income, tax-planning strategies, and results of recent operations. See Note 11 ""Income Taxes"" to the Company's consolidated financial statements for additional information on the composition of these valuation allowances.
The Company recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefit recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit which is greater than 50 percent likely to be realized upon settlement with the taxing authority. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions within the (provision for) benefit from income taxes on the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss.
Net Loss Per Share
Basic net loss per share is computed by dividing the net loss attributable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Unvested restricted stock and restricted stock units are excluded from the denominator of basic net loss per share. Diluted net loss per share is computed by dividing the net loss attributable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares plus the common equivalent shares for the period, including any dilutive effect from such shares. See Note 14 ""Net Loss Per Share Attributable to Common Stockholders"" for further discussion.
Foreign Currency
The functional currency of the Company’s non-U.S. subsidiaries is generally the local currency. The Company translates the financial statements of its non-U.S. subsidiaries to U.S. dollars using month-end exchange rates for assets and liabilities, and average exchange rates for revenue, costs and expenses. The Company records translation gains and losses in accumulated other comprehensive loss as a component of stockholders’ equity. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are included within other expense, net in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.
Concentration of Credit Risk
Certain financial instruments that could be exposed to a concentration of credit risk include cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivable. The Company deposits its cash with financial institutions, and such deposits, at times, may exceed federally insured limits. The Company has not experienced any losses on its deposits of cash and cash equivalents to date. Collateral is not required for accounts receivable. At January 31, 2021 and 2020, no single customer accounted for more than 10% of the Company's accounts receivable. No single customer accounted for more than 10% of the Company's revenue for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash consists of cash on deposit with banks that is stated at cost, which approximates fair value. The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with original maturities of less than three months from the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. .
Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts
Accounts receivable are carried at the original invoiced amount less an allowance for doubtful accounts based on the probability of future collection. The Company estimates its allowance for doubtful accounts based on historical loss patterns, the number of days that billings are past due, current market conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions, in accordance with ASC 326 ""Financial Instruments-Credit Losses."" Accounts receivable are written off when deemed uncollectible and collection of the receivable is no longer being actively pursued. The following table summarizes the allowance for doubtful accounts activity:
(in thousands) Fair Value
Allowance for doubtful accounts as of January 31, 2019
$ 256
Additions 1,246
Deductions - write offs (507)
Allowance for doubtful accounts as of January 31, 2020
Additions 2,547
Deductions - write offs (1,014)
Allowance for doubtful accounts as of January 31, 2021
$ 2,528
Property and Equipment, Net
Property and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated or amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. Furniture and fixtures have an estimated useful life of five years. Office equipment has an estimated useful life of three years. Computer software, which includes capitalized software development costs, has an estimated useful life of two to three years. Leasehold improvements and assets held under operating leases are depreciated over the shorter of the term of the lease or their useful life. Upon retirement or sale of assets, the cost and related accumulated depreciation or amortization are removed from the consolidated balance sheet and the resulting gain or loss is reflected in the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss. Repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred.
Leases
Effective February 1, 2019, the Company adopted ASU 2016-02, ""Leases (Topic ASC 842)"" (""ASU 2016-02""), utilizing the modified retrospective adoption approach. The Company elected the package of practical expedients to not reassess prior conclusions related to lease identification, classification, and initial direct costs, and did not elect the hindsight practical expedient which would have permitted the use of hindsight in determining the lease term and assessing impairment. Under ASC 842, lease expense is recognized as a single lease cost on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The lease term consists of non-cancelable periods, and may include options to extend or terminate the lease term, when it is reasonably certain such options will be exercised.
The Company enters into contracts in the normal course of business and assesses whether any such contracts contain a lease. The Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception if it conveys the right to control the identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. The Company classifies leases as operating or financing in nature, and records the associated lease liability and right-of-use asset on its balance sheet. The lease liability represents the present value of future lease payments, net of lease incentives, discounted using an incremental borrowing rate, which is a management estimate based on the information available
at the commencement date of a lease arrangement. With respect to operating lease arrangements, the Company accounts for lease components, and non-lease components that are fixed, as a single lease component. Non-lease components that are variable are expensed as incurred as in the statement of operations and comprehensive loss. The Company recognizes costs associated with lease arrangements having an initial term of 12 months or less (""short-term leases"") on a straight-line basis over the lease term; such short-term leases are not recorded on the balance sheet.
Prior to adoption, during the fiscal year ended January 31, 2019, the Company accounted for leases under ASC 840, whereby rent expense associated with operating leases was recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Goodwill and Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business combination. Goodwill is not amortized but is subject to periodic testing for impairment in accordance with ASC Topic 350, “Intangibles-Goodwill and Other.” The Company’s goodwill is evaluated at the entity level as it is determined there is one reporting unit. The Company performs its annual impairment test on November 1st of each year, or more frequently if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. The Company considers the following potential indicators of impairment: significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results, significant changes in the Company’s use of acquired assets or the strategy of the Company’s overall business, significant negative industry or economic trends and a significant decline in the value of the Company’s enterprise value for a sustained period.
The Company’s intangible assets with definite lives consist of customer relationships and domains, which are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives of 7 and 15 years, respectively. Long-lived assets, including intangible assets with finite lives, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable in accordance with ASC Topic 360, “Property, Plant, and Equipment.” The Company assesses the impairment of long-lived intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. The Company has not recorded impairment charges on intangible assets for the periods presented in these consolidated financial statements.
Deferred Financing Costs
Financing costs incurred with securing a revolving line of credit are deferred and amortized to interest expense over the term of the agreement. Financing costs associated with revolving credit arrangements are deferred, regardless of whether a balance is outstanding. The Company includes deferred financing costs in prepaid and other current assets or other long term assets on the consolidated balance sheet.
Legal and Other Contingencies
From time to time, the Company may be a party to litigation and subject to claims incident to the ordinary course of business, including intellectual property claims, labor and employment claims, breach of contract claims and other asserted and unasserted claims. The Company investigates these claims as they arise and accrues estimates for resolution of legal and other contingencies when losses are probable and estimable.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
New Accounting Standard To Be Adopted - ASU 2019-12
In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12 ""Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes"", which simplifies the accounting for income taxes, eliminates certain exceptions within ASC Topic 740, ""Income Taxes,"" and clarifies certain aspects of the current guidance to promote consistency among reporting entities. Most amendments within the standard are required to be applied on a prospective basis, while certain amendments must be applied on a retrospective or modified retrospective basis. The Company plans to adopt this standard on February 1, 2021 and does not expect the adoption to have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.
3. Revenue
Disaggregation of Revenue
The Company disaggregates its revenue from contracts with customers by geographic region, as it believes this best depicts how the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of its revenues and cash flows are affected by economic factors. Revenue by geographic region is determined based on the region of the Company's contracting entity, which may be different than the region of its customers. The following table presents the Company's revenue by geographic region:
Fiscal year ended January 31,
(in thousands) 2021 2020 2019
North America $ 284,792 $ 245,629 $ 197,285
International 69,869 53,200 30,998
Total revenue $ 354,661 $ 298,829 $ 228,283
North America revenue is predominantly attributable to the United States, but also includes Canada. International revenue is predominantly attributable to European countries, but also includes Japan.
The Company's revenue attributable to the United States represented 80%, 82%, and 85% of total revenue, and revenue attributable to Switzerland, which serves as one of the Company's contracting entities for Europe, represented 16%, 14%, and less than 10% of total revenue, respectively, for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019. No other individual country represented more than 10% of total revenue during the fiscal years ended January 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019.
Significant Judgments
Significant judgments and estimates may be required to determine the appropriate application of accounting related to revenue, including whether performance obligations are distinct and assessments regarding the transaction price.
The Company has identified that it has two distinct performance obligations. The Company predominantly recognizes revenue through its performance obligation of a subscription and associated support to the Yext platform. The performance obligation is distinct because a customer's use of the Yext platform is fully functional upon access, does not require any additional development, modification or customization, and is often sold separately. In certain instances, the Company enters into a contract with a customer that includes a promise to provide certain technical or customized professional services, in addition to a promise to provide its subscription and associated support. The Company's professional services performance obligation is distinct as it does not significantly change or enhance the functionality of the Yext platform.
In those instances when a contract includes more than one performance obligation, the Company must allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations on a relative standalone selling price basis. SSP represents the price at which a company would sell a promised product or service separately to a customer.
The Company determines the SSP based on a series of complex factors. The Company's selling prices associated with its subscription and associated support are considered highly variable based on discounting practices, customer geography, customer size, and other such factors. In contrast, the Company's selling prices associated with its professional services are more observable, predictable and consistent. Accordingly, the Company uses the residual method, under which the total transaction price and observable SSP of the professional services performance obligation is used to arrive at the estimated SSP of the subscription and associated support performance obligation.
The Company's revenue is predominantly related to its subscription and associated support to the Yext platform. Professional services revenue accounted for approximately 7%, 5% and 4% of the Company's total revenue for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Contract Liabilities
A contract liability is an obligation to transfer goods or services for which consideration has been received or is due to a customer. The Company's contract liabilities consist primarily of unearned revenue and, to a lesser extent, customer deposits.
As of January 31, 2021 and 2020, unearned revenue, current was $191.8 million and $176.8 million, while unearned revenue, non-current, which is included within other long term liabilities on the Company's consolidated balance sheet was $0.2 million and $0.4 million, respectively. Unearned revenue represents amounts billed, or payments received, in advance of revenue recognition for which the Company has an unconditional obligation to transfer goods or services associated with a non-cancelable contract. Unearned revenue is subsequently recognized as revenue when transfer of control to a customer has occurred. The unearned revenue balance is influenced by several factors, including seasonality, the compounding effects of renewals, and invoice duration, timing and size. The portion of unearned revenue expected to be recognized during the succeeding twelve-month period is classified as unearned revenue, current, and the remaining portion is classified within other long term liabilities in the Company’s consolidated balance sheet.
Substantially all of the $176.8 million of unearned revenue, current as of January 31, 2020 was subsequently recognized as revenue during the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021.
Customer deposits represent payments received in advance in instances where a revenue contract is cancelable in nature, and therefore the Company does not have an unconditional obligation to transfer control to a customer. As of January 31, 2021 and 2020, customer deposits of $0.2 million and $0.9 million were included in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the Company's consolidated balance sheet, respectively.
Remaining Performance Obligations
The transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations represents amounts under non-cancelable contracts expected to be recognized as revenue in future periods, and may be influenced by several factors, including seasonality, the timing of renewals, and contract terms. As of January 31, 2021, the Company had $351.8 million of remaining performance obligations, of which $332.8 million is expected to be recognized as revenue over the next twenty-four months, with the remaining balance expected to be recognized thereafter. As of January 31, 2020, the Company had $328.1 million of remaining performance obligations.
4. Fair Value of Financial Instruments
Fair value is the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Subsequent changes in fair value of these financial assets and liabilities are recognized in earnings or other comprehensive (loss) income when they occur. When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities which are required to be recorded at fair value, the Company considers the principal or most advantageous market in which the Company would transact and the market-based risk measurement or assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the assets or liabilities, such as inherent risk, transfer restrictions, and credit risk.
The Company applies the following fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value into three levels and bases the categorization within the hierarchy upon the lowest level of input that is available and significant to the fair value measurement:
Level 1 inputs are based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2 inputs are based on observable inputs other than Level 1 prices such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets with insufficient volume or infrequent transactions (less active markets); or model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs are observable or can be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.
Level 3 inputs are based on unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of fair value of assets or liabilities, and typically reflect management's estimates of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.
As of January 31, 2021 the Company had $138.8 million of money market funds included in cash and cash equivalents. As of January 31, 2020, the Company had $190.8 million of money market funds included in cash and cash equivalents and $12.1 million of money market funds included in restricted cash on the Company's consolidated balance sheet. These assets were valued using quoted market prices and accordingly were classified as Level 1.
5. Goodwill and Intangible Assets
Goodwill
As of January 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company had goodwill of $4.8 million and $4.5 million, respectively. The changes to goodwill during these periods were due to foreign currency translation adjustments.
Goodwill is not amortized but is subject to periodic testing for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is at or one level below the operating segment level. The Company conducted its annual impairment test for goodwill as of November 1st for each of the fiscal years ended January 31, 2021 and 2020. As a result of the annual tests and interim impairment assessments, the Company determined that goodwill was not impaired and that no events occurred or circumstances changed that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the Company's reporting unit below its carrying amount. However, if certain events occur or circumstances change, it may be necessary to record impairment charges in the future.
Intangible Assets
As of January 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company had intangible assets, net of $0.8 million and $1.3 million, respectively. Intangible assets, net included customer relationships of $0.5 million and $1.1 million as well as domains of $0.2 million and $0.3 million, as of January 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Customer relationships had a weighted average remaining useful life of 0.9 years and domains had a weighted average remaining useful life of 10.0 years as of January 31, 2021.
For the fiscal years ended January 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, amortization expense related to intangible assets totaled $0.6 million for each period. As of January 31, 2021, the future amortization expense of intangible assets is expected to be $0.6 million for the fiscal year ending January 31, 2022 and less than $0.1 million per year through the fiscal year ending January 31, 2032.
Intangible assets with finite lives are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. The Company has no indefinite-lived intangible assets. The Company determined that no events occurred or circumstances changed during the fiscal years ended January 31, 2021 and 2020 that would indicate that its intangible assets with finite lives may not be recoverable. However, if certain events occur or circumstances change, it may be necessary to record impairment charges in the future.

The Company's 2008 Equity Incentive Plan (the ""2008 Plan""), as amended on March 10, 2016, allowed for the issuance of up to 25,912,531 shares of common stock. Awards granted under the 2008 Plan may be incentive stock options (""ISOs""), nonqualified stock options (""NQSOs""), restricted stock and restricted stock units. The 2008 Plan is administered by the Company's Board of Directors, which determines the terms of the options granted, the exercise price, the number of shares subject to option and the option vesting period. No ISO or NQSO is exercisable after 10 years from the date of grant, and option awards will typically vest over a four-year period.
The 2008 Plan was terminated in connection with the adoption of the Company's 2016 Equity Incentive Plan (the ""2016 Plan"") in December 2016, and since the 2008 Plan termination the Company has not granted and will not grant any additional awards under the
2008 Plan. However, the 2008 Plan will continue to govern the terms and conditions of the outstanding awards previously granted thereunder.
2016 Equity Incentive Plan
In December 2016, the Company's Board of Directors adopted, and its stockholders approved, the 2016 Plan. The number of shares reserved for issuance under the 2016 Plan will increase on the first day of each fiscal year during the term of the 2016 Plan by the lesser of: (i) 10,000,000 shares, (ii) 4% of the outstanding shares of common stock as of the last day of the immediately preceding fiscal year; or (iii) such other amount as the Company's Board of Directors may determine. On February 1, 2020, the number of shares of common stock available for issuance under the 2016 Plan was automatically increased according to its terms by 4,633,215 shares. In addition, the shares reserved for issuance under the 2016 Plan also include shares returned to the 2008 Plan as the result of expiration or termination of options or other awards. As of January 31, 2021, the number of shares available for future award under the 2016 Plan is 1,500,883.

The fair value of the common stock is the Company’s closing stock price as reported on the New York Stock Exchange.
The total fair value of restricted stock and restricted stock units vested was $72.4 million, $54.7 million, and $30.4 million for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively.
Employee Stock Purchase Plan
In March 2017, the Company's Board of Directors adopted, and its stockholders approved, the 2017 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (""ESPP""), which became effective on the date it was adopted. The number of shares of the Company's common stock that will be available for sale to employees under the ESPP increases annually on the first day of each fiscal year, in an amount equal to the lesser of: (i) 2,500,000 shares; (ii) 1% of the outstanding shares of the Company's common stock as of the last day of the immediately preceding fiscal year; or (iii) such other amount as the administrator may determine. On February 1, 2020, the number of shares of common stock available for issuance under the ESPP was automatically increased according to its terms by 1,158,304 shares. As of January 31, 2021, a total of 2,834,557 shares of the Company's common stock are available for sale to employees under the ESPP.
In connection with the offering period which ended on March 16, 2020, 373,891 shares of common stock were purchased under the ESPP at a purchase price of $10.01 per share for total proceeds of $3.7 million. In connection with the offering period which ended on September 15, 2020, 324,141 shares of common stock were purchased under the ESPP at a purchase price of $10.01 per share for total proceeds of $3.2 million.
A new offering period began on September 15, 2020 and will end on March 15, 2021. As of January 31, 2021, 315,718 shares are estimated to be purchased at the end of the offering period and $3.2 million has been withheld on behalf of employees for these future purchases under the ESPP and is included in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities.
The Black-Scholes option-pricing model assumptions used to calculate the fair value of shares, estimated at commencement to be purchased during an ESPP offering period were as follows:
Fiscal year ended January 31,
2021 2020 2019
Expected life (years) 0.50 0.50 0.50
Expected volatility 51.44% - 65.48%
42.41% - 60.86%
34.41% - 45.09%
Dividend yield 0.00% 0.00% 0.00%
Risk-free rate 0.12% - 0.29%
1.93% - 2.52%
1.95% - 2.35%
The expected life assumptions were based on each offering period's respective purchase date. The Company estimated the expected volatility assumption based on the historical volatility of its stock price. The risk-free rate assumptions were based on the U.S. treasury yield curve in effect at commencement of the offering period. The dividend yield assumption was zero as the Company has not historically paid any dividends and does not expect to declare or pay any dividends in the foreseeable future.
During the fiscal years ended January 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, the Company recorded $2.8 million, $2.7 million and $2.1 million, respectively, of stock-based compensation expense associated with the ESPP. As of January 31, 2021, total unrecognized compensation cost related to ESPP was $0.4 million, net of estimated forfeitures, which will be amortized over a weighted-average remaining period of 0.12 years.
A new offering period commences on the first trading day on or after March 15th and September 15th each year, or on such other date as the administrator will determine and will end on the first trading day, approximately six months later, on or after September 15th and March 15th, respectively. Participants may purchase the Company’s common stock through payroll deductions, up to a maximum of 15% of their eligible compensation. Unless changed by the administrator, the purchase price for each share of common stock purchased under the ESPP will be 85% of the lower of the fair market value per share on the first trading day of the applicable offering period or the fair market value per share on the last trading day of the applicable offering period.
Stock-Based Compensation Expense
Stock-based compensation represents the cost related to stock-based awards granted in lieu of monetary payment. The Company measures stock-based compensation associated with stock-based awards issued to employees at the grant date, based on the estimated fair value of the award, and recognizes expense on a straight-line basis net of estimated forfeitures over the requisite service period in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.
The Company's stock-based compensation expense for the periods presented was as follows:
Fiscal year ended January 31,
(in thousands) 2021 2020 2019
Cost of revenue $ 5,724 $ 4,115 $ 2,915
Sales and marketing 32,581 31,421 22,519
Research and development 17,071 13,212 8,475
General and administrative 16,918 19,022 10,324
Total stock-based compensation expense $ 72,294 $ 67,770 $ 44,233
General and administrative stock-based compensation expense for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2020 included a $3.6 million one-time RSU cancellation-related expense.
As of January 31, 2021, there was approximately $149.9 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested stock-based awards. This unrecognized compensation cost is expected to be recognized over an estimated remaining weighted-average vesting period of approximately 2.67 years. During the fiscal years ended January 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, the Company capitalized $2.1 million, $1.4 million and $0.7 million, respectively, of stock-based compensation related to software development of additional functionality to the Yext platform.
9. Equity
Preferred Stock
Effective April 2017, the Company’s Board of Directors is authorized to issue up to 50,000,000 shares of preferred stock, $0.001 par value, in one or more series without stockholder approval. The Company's Board of Directors has the discretion to determine the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions, including voting rights, dividend rights, conversion rights, redemption privileges and liquidation preferences, of each series of preferred stock. The issuance of preferred stock could have the effect of restricting dividends on the Company’s common stock, diluting the voting power of its common stock, impairing the liquidation rights of its common stock, or delaying or preventing changes in control or management of the Company. As of January 31, 2021 and 2020, no shares of preferred stock were issued or outstanding.
Common Stock
As of January 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company had authorized 500,000,000 shares of voting $0.001 par value common stock. Each holder of the Company's common stock is entitled to one vote for each share on all matters to be voted upon by the stockholders and there are no cumulative rights. Subject to any preferential rights of any outstanding preferred stock, holders of the Company's common stock are entitled to receive ratably the dividends, if any, as may be declared from time to time by the Company's Board of Directors out of legally available funds. If there is a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, holders of the Company's common stock would be entitled to share in the Company's assets remaining after the payment of liabilities and any preferential rights of any outstanding preferred stock.
Holders of the Company's common stock have no preemptive or conversion rights or other subscription rights, and there are no redemption or sinking fund provisions applicable to the common stock. All outstanding shares of the Company's common stock will be fully paid and non-assessable. The rights, preferences and privileges of the holders of the Company's common stock are subject to, and may be adversely affected by, the rights of the holders of shares of any series of preferred stock which the Company may designate and issue in the future.
Treasury Stock
As of January 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company had 6,505,334 shares of treasury stock which are carried at its cost basis of $11.9 million on the Company's consolidated balance sheets.
10. Debt
On March 11, 2020, the Company entered into a new credit agreement with Silicon Valley Bank (the “Credit Agreement”). No significant debt issuance costs were incurred in association with the Credit Agreement. In January 2021, the Company amended the Credit Agreement which modified the conditions pursuant to which subsidiaries are required to become guarantors.
The Credit Agreement provides for a senior secured revolving loan facility of up to $50.0 million that matures three years after the effective date, with the right subject to certain conditions to add an incremental revolving loan facility of up to $50.0 million in the aggregate. The three year revolving loan facility provides for borrowings up to the amount of the facility with sub-limits of up to (i) $30.0 million to be available for the issuance of letters of credit and (ii) $10.0 million to be available for swingline loans.
Under the Credit Agreement, loans bear interest, at the Company's option, at an annual rate based on LIBOR or a base rate. Loans based on LIBOR shall bear interest at a rate between LIBOR plus 2.50% and LIBOR plus 3.00%, depending on the Company's
average daily usage of the revolving loan facility. Loans based on the base rate shall bear interest at a rate between the base rate minus 0.50% and the base rate plus 0.00%, depending on the Company's average daily usage of the revolving loan facility.
The obligations under the Credit Agreement are secured by a lien on substantially all of the tangible and intangible property of the Company and by a pledge of all of the equity interests of the Company's material direct and indirect domestic subsidiaries and 66% of each class of capital stock of any material first-tier foreign subsidiaries, subject to limited exceptions.
The Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants and restrictions, as well as financial covenants that require the Company to maintain the year-over-year growth rate of its ordinary course recurring revenue for a trailing four fiscal quarter period above specified rates when certain liquidity thresholds are not met and to maintain a consolidated quick ratio of at least 1.50 to 1.00 tested on a monthly basis.
As of January 31, 2020, the Company had back-to-back standby letters of credit for $12.1 million, which were fully secured by a $12.1 million cash deposit and classified as restricted cash on the Company's consolidated balance sheet. In connection with the Credit Agreement, the $12.1 million cash deposit was released and is no longer classified as restricted cash on the Company's consolidated balance sheet as of January 31, 2021.
As of January 31, 2021, the Company was in compliance with all debt covenants. As of such date, the $50.0 million revolving loan facility had $35.7 million available and $14.3 million in letters of credit allocated as security in connection with office space.

In the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021, the Company released a portion of its valuation allowance against certain foreign deferred tax assets resulting in an income tax benefit of $0.7 million, and recorded a U.S. tax benefit of $0.2 million due the expiration of certain statutes of limitations of unrecognized tax benefits.
The Company reconciled its income taxes at the federal statutory income tax rate to the (provision for) benefit from income taxes included within its consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. The reconciliation is as follows:

Deferred Income Taxes
Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of (a) temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes, and (b) operating loss carryforwards. The components of the Company's deferred income taxes were as follows:
As of January 31,
(in thousands) 2021 2020

Net deferred tax asset (liability) $ 954 $ 95
As of January 31, 2021, for federal income tax purposes, the Company had $406.1 million of gross U.S. federal NOL carryforwards, with pre-2018 NOL expiring starting in fiscal 2028 and others indefinitely carried forward.
As of January 31, 2021, for state income tax purposes, the Company had $18.5 million of post-apportioned, tax-effected NOL carryforwards, which expire in fiscal 2024 through fiscal 2040. As of January 31, 2021, the Company had $7.8 million of tax-effected foreign NOL carryforwards which expires starting in fiscal 2026.
Utilization of the Company’s NOL carryforwards in the future will be dependent upon its ability to generate taxable income and could be limited due to ownership changes, as defined under the provisions of Section 382 of the Code and similar state provisions. Utilization of the Company’s foreign NOL carryforwards in the future will be dependent upon the local tax law and regulation.
During the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021, the Company completed transfers of certain non-U.S. customer contracts and the related intangible assets from one of its local subsidiaries to the U.S. in order to better align the ownership of these rights with how the business operates. The transfer resulted in no incremental tax expense in the local jurisdiction, as there were sufficient NOL available to fully offset the tax gain. Additionally, the Company recognized deferred tax assets for the book and tax basis difference on the transferred assets in the U.S., which were fully offset against its valuation allowance.
The Company regularly evaluates the realizability of its deferred tax assets and establishes a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some or all the deferred tax assets will not be realized. In making such a determination, the Company considers all available positive and negative evidence, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income, loss carryback and tax-planning strategies. Generally, more weight is given to objectively verifiable evidence, such as the cumulative loss in recent years, as a significant piece of negative evidence to overcome. During the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021, the valuation allowance had a net increase of $23.9 million from approximately $105.3 million to $129.2 million, primarily due to the impact of the NOL carryforwards established in the current period and other increases in U.S. deferred tax assets. The increase in the valuation allowance was partially offset by the use of the NOL in the local jurisdiction due to the intra-entity asset transfer. The Company also released a portion of the valuation allowance in certain foreign jurisdictions, as these jurisdictions demonstrated a sustained profitability evidenced by three consecutive years of positive earnings as well as forecasted continuing profitability. During the fiscal year ended January 31, 2020, the valuation allowance increased $24.4 million from approximately $80.9 million to $105.3 million, primarily due to the impact of the NOL carryforwards established in the current period and other increases in U.S. deferred tax assets. The Company will continue to assess the realizability of the deferred tax assets in each applicable jurisdiction going forward.
Other Considerations
The Company has not recorded deferred income taxes and withholding taxes with respect to the undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries as such earnings are determined to be reinvested indefinitely. Upon distribution of those earnings in the form of dividends or otherwise, the Company may be subject to income taxes and withholding taxes, the determination of which is not practical as it is dependent on the amount of tax losses or other tax attributes available at the time of repatriation.
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending balance of total unrecognized tax benefits for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019 is as follows:
Fiscal year ended January 31,
(in thousands) 2021 2020 2019

End of period $ 267 $ 493 $ 233
The Company recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the (provision for) benefit from income taxes and recognized less than $0.1 million for interest and penalties in each of the fiscal years ended January 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019. As of January 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019 accrued unrecognized tax benefits were $0.3 million, $0.5 million, and $0.2 million, respectively, and if recognized would reduce the (provision for) benefit from income taxes, and the Company's effective tax rate. During the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021, the Company released $0.2 million unrecognized tax benefits due to a lapse in the statute of limitations. The Company does not expect any significant change in its unrecognized tax benefits during the next twelve months.
The Company is subject to income tax examinations in the United States and various state and foreign jurisdictions. The Company’s most significant operations are in the United States and the earliest open tax year subject to potential examination in the United States is 2008.
12. Leases
The Company's operating lease arrangements are principally for office space. As of January 31, 2021, the Company had $14.2 million of operating lease liabilities, current, $123.6 million of operating lease liabilities, non-current, $104.8 million of operating lease right-of-use assets, and no financing leases, on its consolidated balance sheet. The operating lease arrangements included in the measurement of lease liabilities do not include short-term leases as discussed in Note 2, ""Summary of Significant Accounting Policies"", and had a weighted-average remaining lease term of 9.5 years and a weighted-average discount rate of 5.7%, as of January 31, 2021. During the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021, the Company paid $11.6 million for amounts included in the measurement of lease liabilities and obtained $7.2 million of operating lease right-of-use assets in exchange for lease obligations.
In May 2020, the Company entered into a Surrender Agreement (the ""Surrender Agreement"") of its lease arrangement for its prior corporate headquarters in New York, NY. The previous lease arrangement was scheduled to expire in December 2020. Pursuant to the Surrender Agreement, the Company's lease obligations continued through August 31, 2020.
During the fiscal years ended January 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company recognized $25.7 million and $21.2 million, of lease expense, respectively, which consisted of the following:
Fiscal year ended January 31,

Operating lease expense $ 20,134 $ 16,820
Short-term lease expense 1,053 2,259
Variable lease expense 4,475 2,153
Total lease expense $ 25,662 $ 21,232
Operating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the arrangement beginning on the lease commencement date for lease arrangements that have an initial term greater than twelve months and therefore are recorded on the balance sheet. For the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021, operating lease expense includes lease expense related to the Company's lease arrangement associated with its new corporate headquarters in New York, NY, which commenced in May 2019. Short-term lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term for lease arrangements that have an initial term of 12 months or less and therefore are not recorded on the balance sheet. Variable lease expense is recognized as incurred and consists of real estate taxes and utilities, among other office space related expenses. During the fiscal year ended January 31, 2019, rent expense was $7.3 million.
The total remaining operating lease payments included in the measurement of lease liabilities on the Company's consolidated balance sheet as of January 31, 2021, was as follows (in thousands):

13. Commitments and Contingencies
Contractual Obligations
The Company is obligated to make payments under certain non-cancelable contractual obligations in the normal course of business. The Company's contractual obligations primarily relate to its operating lease arrangements for office space. Its other contractual obligations include contracts with its Knowledge Network application providers, which generally have a term of one year, although some have a term of several years, and its software vendors, among others. These obligations represent minimum contractual payments, or the Company's best estimate for variable elements based on historical payments. The Company's contractual obligations have various expiry dates between fiscal years 2022 and 2035.
As of January 31, 2021, the Company's contractual obligations are as follows (in thousands):

Performance and Payment Bond
The Company's operating lease arrangement associated with its new corporate headquarters in New York, NY requires performance and payment bonds to secure the completion of certain potential construction work, when a reasonable estimate of such work is available. In connection with these bonds, as of January 31, 2021, the Company paid $0.9 million in issuance costs which are recognized as operating expense over the estimated construction period in the Company's consolidated statement of operations.
Legal Proceedings
The Company is and may be involved in various legal proceedings arising in the normal course of business. Although the results of litigation and claims cannot be predicted with certainty, currently, in the opinion of the Company, the likelihood of any material adverse impact on the Company's results of operations, cash flows or the Company's financial position for any such litigation or claims is deemed to be remote. Regardless of the outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on the Company because of defense costs, diversion of management resources and other factors.
Warranties and Indemnifications
The Yext platform is in some cases warranted to perform in a manner consistent with general industry standards that are reasonably applicable and materially in accordance with the Company's product specifications.
The Company's arrangements generally include certain provisions for indemnifying customers against liabilities if its products or services infringe a third-party's intellectual property rights and/or if the Company breaches its contractual agreements with a customer or in instances of negligence, fraud or willful misconduct by the Company. To date, the Company has not incurred any material costs as a result of such obligations and has not accrued any liabilities related to such obligations in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
The Company has also agreed to indemnify certain of its directors and executive officers for costs associated with any fees, expenses, judgments, fines and settlement amounts incurred by any of these persons in any action or proceeding to which any of those persons is, or is threatened to be, made a party by reason of the person's service as a director or officer, including any action by the Company, arising out of that person's services as the Company's director or officer or that person's services provided to any other company or enterprise at the Company's request. The Company maintains director and officer insurance coverage that would generally enable the Company to recover a portion of future amounts paid. The Company may also be subject to indemnification obligations by law with respect to the actions of its employees under certain circumstances and in certain jurisdictions.
14. Net Loss Per Share Attributable to Common Stockholders
The following table sets forth the computation of the basic and diluted net loss per share attributable to common stockholders:
Fiscal year ended January 31,
(in thousands, except share and per share data) 2021 2020 2019
Numerator:
Net loss attributable to common stockholders $ (94,692) $ (121,544) $ (74,837)
Denominator:
Weighted-average common shares outstanding 119,690,378 111,758,946 98,387,366
Net loss per share attributable to common stockholders, basic and diluted $ (0.79) $ (1.09) $ (0.76)
Basic net loss per share is computed by dividing the net loss attributable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Unvested restricted stock and restricted stock units are excluded from the denominator of basic net loss per share. Diluted net loss per share is computed by dividing the net loss attributable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares plus common equivalent shares for the period, including any dilutive effect from such shares.
Since the Company was in a net loss position for all periods presented, net loss per share attributable to common stockholders was the same on a basic and diluted basis, as the inclusion of all potential common equivalent shares outstanding would have been anti-dilutive. Anti-dilutive common equivalent shares were as follows:
As of January 31,
2021 2020 2019
Options to purchase common stock 8,871,890 12,371,254 15,977,235
Restricted stock and restricted stock units 9,545,352 9,910,729 7,703,705
Shares estimated to be purchased under ESPP 315,718 284,222 176,241
Total anti-dilutive common equivalent shares 18,732,960 22,566,205 23,857,181

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the ""Exchange Act"").
Disclosure controls and procedures are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our company’s reports filed under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were ineffective as of January 31, 2021 due to the material weakness related to the processes to calculate, record and account for sales commissions as described below.
Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f). Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2021 based on the guidelines established in the Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013 framework) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
Based on the results of our evaluation, we concluded that as of January 31, 2021 we have not maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as a result of a material weakness associated with our processes to calculate, record and account for sales commissions. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.
The material weakness did not result in any identified material misstatements in the current period consolidated financial statements, nor in any restatements of consolidated financial statements previously reported by us, and there were no changes in previously released financial results. We have begun to develop remediation plans for the material weakness, which are described below under “Remediation Activities.”
The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting has been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, and as part of the audit, has issued an adverse opinion on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2021, which is included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
In connection with the audit of the fiscal year 2020 consolidated financial statements, we and our independent registered public accounting firm identified a material weakness related to our processes to calculate, record and account for sales commissions. The identified deficiencies included controls related to reliance on certain outsourced IT service providers used in the processes to calculate, record and account for sales commissions and the related business process controls that rely upon information that was subject to the outsourced IT service providers’ control environment.
In fiscal year 2021, we worked to remediate the identified deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting identified above as described below:
•Improved governance of our incentive compensation plans
•Implemented new information technology systems to calculate, record and account for sales commissions
•Implemented IT general controls, including logical security and application change management controls for these new information technology systems
•Implemented new automated controls to calculate, record and account for sales commissions
•Implemented new manual controls and strengthened existing controls across the process to calculate, record and account for sales commissions, including management review controls to detect errors in calculated sales commissions
While we are taking steps toward remediating the material weakness, until the controls have been operating for a sufficient period of time and we have concluded that these controls are operating effectively, the material weakness described above will continue to exist. Except as noted above, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by Rules 13a-15(d) and 15d-15(d) of the Exchange Act that occurred during the three months ended January 31, 2021 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
Limitations on the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and implemented, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system’s objectives will be met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues within a company are detected. The inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple errors or mistakes. Controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and may not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Remediation Activities
We are working to remediate the identified deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting relating to processes to calculate, record and account for sales commissions that resulted in a material weakness. Specifically, we are continuing to test and evaluate the new and revised processes and internal controls, including those related to the maintenance of plan participant data and the resulting calculations of amounts paid under our sales incentive compensation plans.
We believe we are making progress toward achieving the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting and disclosure controls; however we cannot provide any assurance that these remediation efforts will be successful or that our internal control over financial reporting will be effective as a result of these efforts. In addition, as we continue to evaluate and work to improve our internal control over financial reporting, we may determine to take additional measures to address control deficiencies or determine to modify the remediation plan described above. We will test and evaluate the implementation of these new and revised processes and internal controls to ascertain whether they are designed and operating effectively to provide reasonable assurance that they will prevent or detect a material error in our financial statements.","Item 9B.

These solutions are supplemented by state-of-the-art analytics and reporting as well as a number of cross-product tools for employee profile management and e-learning content aggregation and delivery. We believe that our people development solutions deliver the following benefits:
•Comprehensive Functionality. Our solutions provide a comprehensive approach to people development by offering products to address all stages of the employee lifecycle: recruiting, onboarding, learning, performance, succession, compensation, enterprise social collaboration, and HR administration processes. Employees use our solutions throughout their careers to engage in performance processes such as goal management, performance reviews, continuous feedback, competency assessments, and compensatory reviews; to complete job-specific and compliance-related training; to evaluate potential career changes, development plans, or succession processes; and to connect and collaborate with co-workers by leveraging enterprise social networking tools. Employee managers and HR managers use our solutions to perform their people development administrative responsibilities effectively throughout their employees’ careers. We believe our comprehensive, unified solutions enable our customers to align their people development processes and practices with their broader strategic goals.
•Flexible and Highly Configurable. Our solutions offer substantial configurability that allow our customers to match the use of our software with their specific business processes and workflows. We also provide web services to facilitate the importing and exporting of data to and from other customer systems, such as enterprise resource planning and human resource information system solutions. Our customers can configure various features, functions, and work-flows in our solutions by business unit, division, department, region, location, job position, pay grade, cost center, or self-defined organizational unit. Our customers are able to adjust features to configure specific processes, such as performance review workflows or training approvals, to match their existing or desired practices. This high level of configurability means that custom coding projects generally are not required to meet the diverse needs of our customers.
•Easy-to-Use, Personalized User Interface. Our solutions employ an intuitive user interface and may be personalized for the end user, typically based on position, division, pay grade, location, manager, and particular use of the solutions. This ease of use limits the need for end-user training, which we believe increases user adoption rates and usage.
•Software-as-a-Service Solutions Lowers the Total Cost of Ownership and Speeds Delivery. Our solutions are accessible through a standard web browser and do not require the large investments in implementation time, personnel, hardware, and consulting that are typical of hosted or on-premise solutions. With a single code base to maintain, we are able to release improved functionality on a quarterly basis. This is a more rapid pace than most hosted or on-premise solution providers can afford to deliver.
•Scalable to Meet the Needs of Organizations. Our solutions have been used by Fortune 100 companies since 2001. While the complex needs of these global corporations required us to build solutions that can scale to support large, geographically-distributed employee bases, our solutions are capable of supporting deployments of various sizes.
•Insights and Predictive Analysis. Our solutions leverage technology powered by a highly refined machine learning system for people development. We also offer a large network of shared talent data. This enables leaders to answer critical questions about how to better hire, manage, retain, and reward talent with dashboards that can be drilled down to individual employee data. Enhanced by additional Cornerstone suite usage, these insights allow organizations to manage their people development process proactively and be strategic with initiatives that affect thousands of employees across many groups and locations. Additionally, the Cornerstone Innovation Lab for Artificial Intelligence (“AI”) unites all our data scientists and data ethics experts across the company to form a center of excellence to advance AI in the workplace.
•Continued Innovation through Collaborative Product Development. We work collaboratively with our customers on an ongoing basis to develop almost every part of our solutions. The vast majority of our thousands of software features were designed using feedback from existing and prospective customers based on their specific functional requests.
•Focus on Data Privacy and Security. We have designed our solutions to meet certain rigorous industry and jurisdictional security standards and to help assure customers that their sensitive data is protected across the system. We use commercially reasonable methods and technology designed to ensure high levels of security by logically segregating each customer’s data from the data of other customers and by enforcing a consistent approach to roles and rights within the system. These restrictions limit system access to only those individuals authorized by our customers. We also employ multiple standard technologies, protocols, and processes to monitor, test, and certify the security of our infrastructure continuously.
Our comprehensive people development solutions help organizations manage key phases of the employee life cycle. To complement our solutions, we offer a number of cross-product tools for analytics and reporting, employee profile management, and e-learning content aggregation.
Learning
Learning. Our Learning solutions help customers deliver mobile-ready, enterprise-class training, and development programs. They link employee development to other parts of the talent management lifecycle, including onboarding, performance management, and succession planning. They support all forms of learning, including online, instructor-led, and collaborative on-the-job learning, as well as robust reporting and embedded predictive analytics. With tens of thousands of online training titles from dozens of global content providers accessible through our engaging learning experience solutions, customers reduce overall training expenses, while quickly transforming their learning programs with modern, curated content. The access to personalized content delivered at scale with Cornerstone’s machine learning technology builds a culture of continuous learning, boosting employee engagement and retention.
Cornerstone Extended Enterprise. Our extended enterprise product helps customers provide training and enablement to their customers, vendors, and distributors. The extended enterprise product empowers customers to develop new profit centers, increase sales, cut support costs, and boost channel productivity.
Cornerstone for Salesforce. Our Cornerstone for Salesforce product is an enablement solution for employees, partners, and customers which leverages customers’ Salesforce investments across all products to build high-performance sales and service teams with triggered, just-in-time training.
Content
Content. Our Content solution enables organizations to deliver fresh, modern content to their workforce. We have entered into license agreements with a wide range of vendors that provide off-the-shelf e-learning content and custom learning content development services. Through this network, we offer an extensive library of online training content to our customers through our Learning solutions.
Content Anytime. Our proprietary, foundational e-learning content subscriptions provide access to pre-curated packages, which include content from our own content production arm (Cornerstone Studios) and other content partners, on a variety of popular topics.
Performance
Performance. Our performance management solutions allow customers to direct and measure performance at the individual, departmental, and organizational levels through ongoing competency management, organizational goal setting, performance appraisal, development planning, and feedback. Performance data can also be used by the Learning solutions to set training priorities and to make informed workforce planning decisions.
Succession. Our succession solutions allow customers to proactively plan for organizational change and talent mobility. They serve both the employee looking for career advancement and management team members planning for the future. Employees can share career preferences and discover development opportunities. Management team members can utilize tools provided to identify skill gaps, implement development plans, and create talent pools for future needs.
Compensation. Our compensation solutions allow customers to reward their employees for hard work in direct relation to performance. They enable customers to make more informed decisions about the allocation of base pay, bonus, and equity awards.
Careers
Careers. Our Careers solution supports continuous career development and enables managers to be better coaches through a range of capabilities including the ability to hold 1:1s to track team development, goal setting, creation of development plans, pulse surveys, career exploration tools and the ability to provide continuous feedback. By helping people continuously perform better and achieve their goals, businesses will achieve their goals as well.
Recruiting
Recruiting. Our applicant tracking solutions support the modern ways that organizations attract and hire new employees. From easily tracking applicants through the hiring process, to managing interviews and tracking feedback, our solutions simplify processes to save recruiters and hiring managers time. With mobile-friendly, customizable career sites, organizations can showcase their unique employer brand to attract top talent.
Onboarding. Our onboarding solutions enable customers to tailor resources based on a new hire’s specific position, avoiding wasted effort and enabling new hires to focus on meaningful activities that accelerate productivity. They help new employees acclimate quickly by providing a personalized, modern, onboarding experience that equips them with the right resources. The onboarding product complements the recruiting product by providing a seamless and engaging experience for the employee, while reducing administrative burden and promoting collaboration across departments.
HR
HR. Our HR solution offers a modern interface for centralized HR administration across an organization’s disparate systems. Acting as a source of truth for core employee and talent data, the system supports employee self-service, absence management, organization management, and records administration.
View. Our view solution allows customers to access HR data across our people development products. The view product enables organizations to utilize interactive data visualization tools to discover their top performers and future leaders, proactively answer workforce questions, and achieve business results.
Benchmark. Our benchmark solution enables organizations to compare internal employee data with peers in external companies or across divisions, subdivisions, subsidiaries, or regions within their own organization. Both options allow the organization to visualize how they compare against custom and internal business segments across a variety of metrics.
Our Strategy
Our goal is to empower people, organizations, and communities to realize their potential with comprehensive people development solutions that are built to last. Our growth strategy since inception has been deliberate and focused on long-term success. This has allowed us to weather periods of economic turmoil and significant changes in the markets we serve without experiencing business contraction. We plan to continue with the same systematic approach in the future. Key elements of our strategy include:
Continue to Innovate and Extend Our Technological Leadership. Over the last 20 years, we believe we have developed a deep understanding of the people development challenges our customers face. We continually collaborate with our customers to build extensive functionality that addresses their specific needs and requests. We plan to continue to leverage our expertise in people development and customer relationships to develop new products, features, and functionality that will enhance our solutions and expand our addressable market. We plan to continue our policy of implementing best practices across our organization, expanding our technical operations, and investing in our network infrastructure and service capabilities in order to support continued future growth. We believe that continued innovation is key to success in expanding our business with existing customers and reaching new customers. We plan to continue to invest in research and development innovation initiatives, such as our Cornerstone Innovation Lab, to develop new products.
Retain and Expand Business with Existing Customers. We believe our existing installed base of customers offers a substantial opportunity for growth, and we plan to undertake initiatives to improve our customer retention as well as expand sales of new and existing products into our customer base.
•Focus on Customer Success, Retention, and Growth. We believe focusing on our customers’ success leads to our own success. We have continued to build on our Customer Success Framework that governs our operating model. We strive to maximize our customer retention rates by continuing to invest in our global support resources and improving upon our delivery model by investing in training and support initiatives to ensure that service requirements are met with strong satisfaction. Our net annual dollar retention rate in 2020 was 95.1 %, a decline from 104.6 % in 2019. This decline was driven by the anticipated churn of a significant non-recurring contract signed in 2019, churn from (or one-time concessions provided to) customers impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, and expected churn in our non-core product base.
•Sell Additional Products to Existing Customers. We believe there is a significant growth opportunity in selling additional functionality to our existing customers. Many customers have added functionality subsequent to their initial deployments as they recognize the benefits of our unified solutions. With our expanding product portfolio functionality, we believe significant upsell opportunity remains within our existing customer base. Furthermore, we believe the addition of customers acquired from Saba offers a significant cross-sell opportunity for products within our existing portfolio, including but not limited to, Content Anytime.
Focus on Growing Recurring Revenue. Our go-to-market strategy involves driving recurring revenue growth. We believe our primary growth drivers are as follows:
•Continue to Invest in Direct Sales Initiatives Domestically. We believe the market for people development is large and remains significantly underpenetrated. We plan to continue to invest resources in direct sales initiatives to acquire new customers. We believe concentrating sales resources in markets with higher win rates will provide us the flexibility and return on investment to test new markets for growth.
•Continue to Invest in Our International Operations. We believe a substantial opportunity exists to continue to grow sales of our solutions internationally. We intend to continue to grow our Europe, Middle East, and Africa (“EMEA”) and Asia-Pacific and Japan (“APJ”) operations. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we generated 36.6 % of our total revenue from regions outside of the United States. We expect this percentage to grow in the future.
•Continue to Grow and Develop Our Content Anytime Subscriptions. We believe there is a significant market opportunity for developing employees throughout their careers with modern, fresh e-learning content. Our Content Anytime subscription solution provides access to industry leading content which we believe will increase user engagement with our solution. Our content partners for Content Anytime include industry leaders as well as regional, functional, and vertically-focused online training providers. In addition, we have agreements with providers of specific competency models for use by our customers directly in our people development solutions. We intend to enter into additional license agreements to continue providing the best content available for our customers. Furthermore, we plan to continue to invest in developing new Content Anytime subscriptions that focus on highly regulated industries, such as the public sector and healthcare, to meet demand from existing and new customers.
•Expand the Ecosystem. We have migrated a sizable portion of our implementation services to our partners, and have recently migrated Saba’s legacy implementation services to our partners. In recent years, we have also expanded our relationships with various third-party consulting firms to deliver the successful implementation of our solutions and to optimize our customers’ use of our solutions during the terms of their engagements. Our partner strategy and experience includes certifications and curricula developed to facilitate successful delivery by our partners and continued high customer satisfaction. We believe we have a significant opportunity to leverage these third-parties interested in building or expanding their businesses to increase our market penetration.
Increase Operating Income and Free Cash Flow. We are focused on managing our costs while making smart investments to scale our operations, which we believe will support growth in recurring revenue and our long-term success over time. We have been optimizing our network delivery operations for the long-term by transitioning our data center operations to the public cloud, which we believe will provide us the long-term flexibility to expand our solutions and enter new markets without having to invest in and develop new local data centers. We plan to continue to assess and execute on operational excellence initiatives to optimize our margin profile, which we believe will enable further leverage in our expense structure and growth in operating income and free cash flow.
Acquisitions and Strategic Investments. We may acquire or invest in additional businesses, products, or technologies that we believe will complement or expand our solutions, enhance our technical capabilities, or otherwise offer growth opportunities. Most recently, in April 2020, we acquired Saba, a provider of talent experience solutions. In January 2020, we acquired Clustree, a developer of a skills engine and skills ontology. In December 2019, we invested in Talespin Inc. (“Talespin”), a developer of enterprise virtual reality training software. In November 2018, we acquired Grovo Learning, Inc. (“Grovo”), a provider of Microlearning® content. In September 2018, we acquired Workpop Inc. (“Workpop”), a web and mobile solution for candidates and hiring managers in service-based industries. We acquired Saba to expand our customer base; we acquired Clustree to accelerate the development of a skills engine; we acquired Grovo to enhance our Content solution; and we acquired Workpop to enhance our Recruiting solutions.
Global Customer Success
We are dedicated to the success of our customers. We have developed a Customer Success Framework, which governs our operational model, the structure of our customer management teams, and the types of services necessary at each stage of a customer’s lifecycle.
Within this framework, we have developed the following roles with primary responsibility to our customers at various levels of their organizations:
•Customer executives who interact with executive-level sponsors and human resources executives at a customer and are focused on the overall relationship, including sales to existing customers;
•Customer success managers who work directly with executive-level sponsors and human resources executives at our customers to maximize the value of their investment in our people development solutions; and
•Product specialists who interact with customer administrators and are focused on features and functions of our people development solutions.
We offer support in multiple languages, at multiple levels, and through multiple channels, including global support coverage available 24 hours a day, seven days a week. We use our own enterprise social collaboration product to provide our customers and distributors with a virtual community to collaborate on product design, release management, and best practices.
We monitor customer satisfaction internally as part of formalized programs and at regular intervals during the customer lifecycle, including during the transition from sales to implementation, at the completion of a consulting project, and daily based on interactions with our customer-facing teams.
Technology, Operations, and Research and Development
The cloud versions of our flagship people development solutions are designed and deployed with an on-demand, multi-tenant, and multi-user architecture which our customers access via a standard web browser. We utilize a single code base, with all of our customers running on the current version of our software. We employ a modularized architecture to balance the load of customers on separate sub-environments, as well as to provide a flexible method for scalability without impacting other parts of the current environment. This architecture allows us to provide the high levels of uptime required by our customers. Our existing infrastructure has been designed with sufficient capacity to meet our current and estimated near term future needs. Global uptime in 2020 was 99.997%.
Currently, we physically host our solutions for our customers in secure third-party data center facilities located in the US, the United Kingdom (“UK”), Canada, Australia, The Netherlands, France, and Germany. We continue to evaluate other locations for physically hosting our solutions and, therefore, these locations may change. These facilities provide leading security and other protections including physical security, biometric access controls, systems security, redundant power, and environmental controls.
We are continuing to build out services and functionality in the public cloud with a view to migrating more software to the public cloud over time. This strategy provides us flexibility to service customers in new and emerging regions and scale our deployment capabilities as we continue moving from a monolithic to a microservices architecture. We maintain the same or higher standards of security and compliance with our public cloud providers as we do in our leased facilities. One of our Recruiting solutions, TalentLink, is fully hosted in multiple Amazon Web Services (“AWS”) regions.
In addition, we maintain legacy implementations of our on-premise software solutions, where customers are responsible for their own infrastructure. We are actively promoting migration to the cloud versions of these solutions where appropriate.
Our ability to compete depends largely on our continuous commitment to product development and ability to rapidly introduce new products, technologies, features, and functionality. The responsibilities of our research and development organization include product management, product development, quality assurance, IT security, and technology operations. Our research and development organization is global, with our major engineering centers currently located in the US, Israel, New Zealand, Poland, and India.
Sales and Marketing
Sales
We sell our software, content, and services both directly through our sales force and indirectly through our domestic and international network of distributors. We currently service customers in a wide range of industries, including, among others business services, financial services, healthcare, pharmaceuticals, insurance, manufacturing, retail, and high technology. We have a number of direct sales teams organized by market, industry vertical, and geographic regions such as the Americas, EMEA, and APJ.
Our direct sales team is supported by product specialists who provide technical and product expertise to facilitate the sales process. Our sales enablement professionals provide on-boarding and ongoing professional development for the sales professionals to increase their effectiveness at selling in the field. We also maintain a separate team of customer executives responsible for renewals and upsells to existing customers.
Marketing
We manage global demand generation programs, develop sales pipelines, and enhance brand awareness through our marketing initiatives. Our marketing programs target HR executives, technology professionals, and senior business leaders. Our principal marketing initiatives include:
•Demand Generation. Our demand generation activities include targeted account-based marketing, lead generation through email and direct mail campaigns, participation in industry events, securing event speaking opportunities, and online marketing, including both search engine marketing and organic search engine optimization online marketing.
•Corporate Marketing. We market to our customers by leveraging product marketing, customer success stories, thought leadership content, and brand awareness advertising campaigns. Additionally, we host product advisory communities and executive advisory councils; we also co-market with our strategic distributors, including joint press announcements and demand generation activities.
•Marketing Communications. We undertake media relations, corporate communications, industry analyst and influencer relations activities, customer advocacy, and social media engagement.
Competition
The market for people development software is highly competitive, rapidly evolving, and fragmented. This market is subject to changing technology, shifting customer needs, and frequent introductions of new products and services.
Most of our sales efforts are competitive, often involving requests for proposals. We compete primarily on the basis of providing a highly configurable, comprehensive, fully unified solutions for people development as opposed to specific service offerings.
In the applicant tracking systems market which our Recruiting solutions serve, our principal competitors include companies such as iCIMS, Oracle Corporation (Taleo), and SAP America, Inc. (SuccessFactors). In the learning systems market, which our Learning solutions each serve, our principal competitors include companies such as Oracle Corporation, SAP America, Inc. (SuccessFactors), SkillSoft Limited (SumTotal), Docebo, and Workday, Inc. In the performance management and continuous performance systems market, which our Performance solutions each serve, our principal competitors include companies such as Oracle Corporation, SAP America, Inc. (SuccessFactors), Talentsoft SA, and Workday, Inc. In the learning content market, which our Content solution serves, our principal competitors include SkillSoft Limited and LinkedIn Learning. In the core HR market, which our HR solution serves, our principal competitors include Oracle Corporation, Workday, Inc., and SAP America, Inc. (SuccessFactors). When implemented together, these products also serve as integrated talent and HCM solutions, competing primarily against SkillSoft Limited (SumTotal), Oracle Corporation, Workday, Inc., and SAP America, Inc. (SuccessFactors). These vendors are, like us, largely SaaS providers. We compete in these markets primarily on the basis of:
•the level of integration of our product offerings within our people development solutions;
•the breadth and depth of our product functionality;
•the flexibility and configurability of our product offerings to meet the changing content and workflow requirements of our customers’ business units;
•the quality of our service and focus on customer success;
•our ability to provide scalability and flexibility for large and complex global deployments;
•our ability to meet the needs of highly regulated industries; and
•the ease of use of our product offerings and overall user experience.
In addition, we occasionally compete with custom-built software that is designed to support the needs of a single organization, as well as with third-party talent and human resource application providers that focus on specific aspects of people development.
Many of our competitors and potential competitors have greater name recognition, longer operating histories, and larger marketing resources than we do. For additional information, see “Risk Factors-Risks Related to the Nature of Our Business-The market in which we participate is intensely competitive, and if we do not compete effectively, our operating results could be harmed.”
Human Capital Management
At Cornerstone, our people are our greatest asset. We believe that when you create a work culture that fosters ongoing growth and development, your people can rise to become extraordinary. Just as we support our customers with the technology, learning content, and expertise to bring out the best in their people, we do the same for our people. We are committed to ensuring our people have the right skills, capabilities, and opportunities to adapt and thrive. When our people succeed, our business does, too.
At December 31, 2020, we had approximately 2,900 employees in more than 20 countries around the world.
Culture of Growth and Development
More than 20 years ago, we started with a mission to educate the world. That focus on learning is still a core piece of who we are as a company. We provide numerous opportunities and resources to instill a culture of continuous learning, starting with our own people. We provide online learning courses using our own technology to help our people build new skills and grow in their careers. In addition to letting people explore our broad library of learning content, we also serve up recommended trainings based on an individual’s career path and interest areas.
Additionally, we offer a range of other training programs in-house that are taught by our bench of certified trainers, including leadership development, soft-skill, and technical training and a variety of other learning opportunities from personal enrichment to deep skill-building workshops. Throughout the year, we host Development Days where we create a full day of training sessions and engaging opportunities for our people to learn and share their skills with others. We also encourage our people to learn on-the-job by signing up for our internal Gig Program, which matches individuals with short-term development assignments that fulfill an emerging business need.
To measure growth and success, all permanent employees receive structured performance reviews through Quarterly Conversations with their managers that focus on both performance evaluations and strategies for ongoing development.
Recruiting the Best
For Cornerstone, finding the best talent starts with having great recruiters. Similar to how we support our customers with recruiting solutions, we use our own technology to equip our recruiting team with the right tools to be successful. We provide our recruiters with a resource hub that features a wide variety of vital trainings to help them be successful, such as recruiting basics, process insights and best practices, unconscious bias training, behavioral-based interview training, referral program details, job marketing and creating an appealing job description, system utilization training, internal mobility, and diversity and inclusion. When our recruiters can be their best, job candidates and new hires can have a truly world-class experience.
Internship Opportunities
We also value the opportunity to give people new to the business world the opportunity to learn and hone their skills. We offer several internship programs for undergraduates and graduate students at our offices around the world where we partner with programs like AIESEC, an international youth-run, not-for-profit organization that provides young people with leadership development, cross-cultural internships, and global volunteer exchange experiences to provide graduates with work experience.
Commitment to Diversity and Inclusion
We have prioritized building an inclusive culture that supports a diverse, engaged, and thriving workforce. Along with our Chief Diversity Officer, we have established a Diversity Leadership Council of employees to help advance diversity and inclusion across our company. We require employee training on diversity and inclusion, including unconscious bias training for all employees, as well as recurring training on our anti-discrimination and anti-harassment policies.
To help recruit a diverse workforce, we review every position for diversity areas of focus. When conducting a search, we post jobs to a variety of diversity job boards and post to targeted, diverse communities. In combination with these extensive sourcing efforts we conduct: job description bias review, diverse interview panels, interview accommodation as needed, and unconscious bias training for hiring managers and interviewers.
Once hired, we encourage our people to explore our employee resource groups, called Cornerstar Resource Groups (“CRGs”), created by our employees and enabled by the company to effect change and successfully serve as advocates for inclusion and belonging. Each of our CRGs has at least one member who represents them on our Diversity Leadership Council to share their best practices, learn from each other, and identify ways to collaborate and support each other to ensure that our CRGs are helping our culture to thrive.
To monitor the success of our diversity and inclusion programs and areas for improvement, we run quarterly diversity audits and provide our executives with reports about regional and functional diversity statistics on retention, promotion, and percentage of diverse representation.
Giving Our People a Voice
Giving our people the opportunity to provide feedback and voice their concerns is an important part of our culture. Not only do we conduct robust employee engagement surveys at least once a year, we also conduct periodic pulse surveys on specific engagement topics throughout the year. To promote an open feedback culture, we use our own product, Check-ins, collect feedback about our leaders, run 360 degree reviews, and offer an anonymous Speak Up hotline.
Our COVID-19 Response
We believe we have a duty to safeguard the health of all our people and their families, our customers and visitors, and the community at large from infectious diseases (such as the COVID-19 pandemic) by providing and maintaining a safe workplace free of known hazards. We have implemented policies and practices that are designed to suppress the spread of the COVID-19 virus, such as flexible work-from-home options, social distancing, wearing approved face coverings, hand hygiene, telecommuting, and limiting travel. These safety measures are here to stay for the foreseeable future.
Given how the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted the world, we regularly engage with our people about mental health awareness and focus on change resiliency while offering support through benefit providers, Employee Assistance Programs, a dedicated Mental Health Day, access to online gym solutions, and a COVID-19 Relief Fund for those severely financially impacted by the pandemic.
Proprietary Rights
To safeguard our proprietary and intellectual property rights, we rely upon a combination of patent, copyright, trade secret, and trademark laws in the US and in other jurisdictions and on contractual restrictions. We have confidentiality and license agreements with employees, contractors, customers, distributors, and other third parties, which limit access to and use of our proprietary information and software.
Though we rely in part upon these legal and contractual protections, we believe that factors such as the skills and ingenuity of our employees, creation of new suites, features, and functionality, collaboration with our customers, and frequent enhancements to our solutions are larger contributors to our success in the marketplace.
Government Contracts
Many of our contracts with government agencies are subject to termination at the election of the government agency. While our government contracts generally do not provide for renegotiation of fees at the election of the government, it is possible that the government agency could request, and that we could under certain circumstances agree to, the renegotiation of the payments otherwise payable under such contracts. However, we have not in the past renegotiated significant payment terms under our government contracts. For additional information, see “Risk Factors-Risks Related to the Nature of Our Business-Our sales to government entities are subject to a number of additional challenges and risks.”
Seasonality
Our sales are seasonal in nature. We sign a higher percentage of agreements with new customers, as well as renewal agreements with existing customers, in the fourth quarter of each year. In addition, within a given quarter, we sign a significant portion of these agreements during the last two months of that quarter. Our agreements generally come up for renewal at the same time of the year they were originally signed, which further amplifies the seasonal nature of our sales.
The Cornerstone OnDemand Foundation
To demonstrate our commitment to empowering people and communities, we helped form the Cornerstone OnDemand Foundation (the “Foundation”) in 2010. The Foundation seeks to empower communities in the US and internationally by increasing the impact of the non-profit sector through the utilization of our people development solutions and capacity building programs.
The Foundation focuses its efforts on the areas of education, workforce development, and disaster relief. We have enlisted the help of our employees, customers, and distributors to support the Foundation in its efforts. The Foundation is designed to be self-sustaining over time through a variety of ongoing funding streams, such as donations, sponsorships, and distribution fees.

The SEC maintains an Internet site (www.sec.gov) that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC.","Item 1A. Risk Factors
The following risk factors and other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K should be carefully considered. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we presently deem less significant may also impair our business operations. Please see “Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” for a discussion of the forward-looking statements that are qualified by these risk factors. If any of the events or circumstances described in the following risk factors actually occur, our business, operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.
Risks Related to the Nature of Our Business
Unfavorable conditions in our industry or the global markets, or reductions in information technology spending, could limit our ability to grow our business and negatively affect our operating results.
Our operating results may vary based on the impact of changes in our industry or the global economy on us or our customers. The US and other key international economies continue to experience events in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic that may result, and have at times in the past experienced cyclical downturns that have resulted, in a significant weakening of the economy, limited availability of credit, a reduction in business confidence and activity, and other difficulties that may affect one or more of the industries to which we sell our services. In addition to the COVID-19 pandemic, developments such as the UK’s exit from the European Union (the “EU”), evolving trade policies between the US and international trade partners, and conflicts in the Middle East and elsewhere have created many economic and political uncertainties which have impacted worldwide markets. These global economic and political conditions may impact our business in a number of ways. The revenue growth and potential profitability of our business depends on demand for enterprise application software generally and for people development solutions in particular. We sell our people development solutions primarily to large, mid-sized, and small business organizations whose businesses fluctuate based on general economic and business conditions. In addition, a portion of our revenue is attributable to the number of users of our products at each of our customers, which in turn is influenced by the employment and hiring patterns of our customers and potential customers. To the extent that economic uncertainty or weak economic conditions, whether in connection with the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic or otherwise, cause our customers and potential customers to freeze or reduce their headcount, demand for our products may be negatively affected. In connection with the COVID-19 pandemic, we have experienced lengthening of sales cycles, delayed payments, and requests for extensions of payment terms from certain customers. Additionally, economic downturns have historically resulted in overall reductions in spending on information technology and people development solutions as well as pressure from customers and potential customers for extended billing terms. If economic, political, or market conditions deteriorate, or if there is uncertainty around these conditions, our customers and potential customers may elect to decrease their information technology and people development budgets by deferring or reconsidering product purchases, which would limit our ability to grow our business and negatively affect our operating results.
Our business depends substantially on the level of our customer satisfaction and specifically on customers renewing their agreements with us, purchasing additional products from us, or adding additional users. Any significant decline in our customer satisfaction rates, customer renewal rates, or the rates at which our customers purchase additional products or add additional users would harm our future operating results.
In order for us to improve our operating results, it is important that our customer satisfaction remains high, that our customers renew their agreements with us when the initial contract term expires, and that they also purchase additional products or add additional users. Our customers have no obligation to renew their subscriptions after the initial subscription period, and there is no assurance that our customers will renew their subscriptions at the same or a higher level of service, if at all. Every year, some of our customers elect not to renew their agreements with us. Moreover, certain of our customers have the right to cancel their agreements for convenience, subject to certain notice requirements and, in some cases, early termination fees. Our customer renewal rates may decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including their satisfaction or dissatisfaction with our products, our customer service, our pricing, the prices of competing products or services, mergers and acquisitions affecting our customer base and/or the acquired customer base, reduced hiring by our customers, or reductions in our customers’ spending levels. If our customers do not renew their subscriptions, renew on less favorable terms, fail to purchase additional products, or fail to add new users, our revenue may decline and our operating results may be harmed.
The market in which we participate is intensely competitive, and if we do not compete effectively, our operating results could be harmed.
The market for people development solutions is highly competitive, rapidly evolving and fragmented. Many of our competitors and potential competitors are larger and have greater brand name recognition, much longer operating histories, larger marketing budgets and significantly greater resources than we do. Further, if one or more of our competitors were to merge, acquire or partner with another of our competitors, the change in the competitive landscape could adversely affect our business. Our competitors may also establish or strengthen cooperative relationships with our current or future strategic distributors, systems integrators, HR outsourcers, payroll services companies, third-party consulting firms, or other parties with whom we have relationships, thereby limiting our ability to promote our products and limiting the number of consultants available to implement our products. In addition, with the introduction of new technologies and market entrants, we expect competition to intensify in the future. Any of these events could disrupt our operations, reduce our revenue, or harm our business generally.
We face competition from desktop software tools and custom-built software that is designed to support the needs of a single organization, as well as from third-party talent and human resource application providers. These software vendors include, without limitation, iCIMS, Oracle Corporation (Taleo), SAP America, Inc. (SuccessFactors), SkillSoft Limited (SumTotal), Talentsoft SA, Docebo, LinkedIn Learning, and Workday, Inc. In addition, some of the parties with which we maintain business alliances offer, or may offer, products or services that compete with our products or services.
Many of our competitors are able to devote greater resources to the development, promotion, and sale of their products and services. In addition, many of our competitors have established marketing relationships, access to larger customer bases and major distribution agreements with consultants, system integrators, and distributors. Moreover, many software vendors can bundle human resource products or offer such products at a lower price as part of a larger product sale. In addition, some competitors may offer software that addresses one or a limited number of people development functions at a lower price point or with greater depth than our products. As a result, our competitors may be able to respond more quickly and effectively than we can to new or changing opportunities, technologies, standards, or customer requirements, and they may also be better able to respond to operational disruptions (such as in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic) than we are. Further, some potential customers, particularly large enterprises, may elect to develop their own internal products. For all of these reasons, we may not be able to compete successfully against our current and future competitors.
Because of how we recognize revenue, a significant downturn in our business may not be immediately reflected in our operating results.
Generally, we recognize revenue from subscription agreements ratably over the terms of these agreements, which is typically three years for our people development solutions. As a result, a significant portion of the revenue we report in each quarter is generated from customer agreements entered into during previous periods. Consequently, a decline in new subscriptions in any one quarter may not significantly impact our revenue and financial performance in that quarter, but will negatively affect our revenue, or rate of revenue growth, and financial performance in future quarters.
In addition, if subscription agreements expire and are not renewed in the same quarter, our revenue and financial performance in that quarter and subsequent quarters will be negatively affected. However, the revenue impact may not be immediately reflected in our operating results to the extent there is an offsetting increase in revenue from services contracts performed in that same quarter.
Finally, we may be unable to adjust our fixed costs in response to reduced revenue. Accordingly, the effect of significant declines in sales and market acceptance of our products may not be reflected in our short-term operating results.
Defects in our solutions could affect our reputation, result in significant costs to us, and impair our ability to sell our products and related services.
Defects in our solutions could adversely affect our reputation, result in significant costs to us, and impair our ability to sell our products in the future. The costs incurred in correcting any product defects may be substantial and could adversely affect our operating results. Although we continually test our products for defects and work with customers through our customer support organization to identify and correct errors, defects in our products are likely to occur in the future. Any defects that cause interruptions to the availability of our products could result in:
•lost or delayed market acceptance and sales of our products;
•early termination of customer agreements or loss of customers;
•credits or refunds to customers;
•product liability suits against us;
•diversion of development resources;
•injury to our reputation; and
•increased maintenance and warranty costs.
While our customer agreements typically contain limitations and disclaimers that purport to limit our liability for damages related to defects in our products, such limitations and disclaimers may not be enforced by a court or other tribunal or otherwise effectively protect us from such claims.
Evolving regulation of the Internet, changes in the infrastructure underlying the Internet, or interruptions in Internet access may adversely affect our financial condition by increasing our expenditures and causing customer dissatisfaction.
As Internet commerce continues to evolve, regulation by federal, state, or foreign agencies may increase. We are particularly sensitive to these risks because the Internet is a critical component of our business model. In addition, taxation of services provided over the Internet or other charges for accessing the Internet may be imposed by government agencies or private organizations. Changes in laws or regulations that adversely affect the growth, popularity or use of the Internet, or impact the way that Internet service providers treat Internet traffic, including laws impacting net neutrality and laws requiring local storage of certain types of data in foreign jurisdictions, may negatively increase our operating costs or otherwise impact our business. Any regulation imposing greater fees for Internet use or restricting information exchanged over the Internet could result in a decline in the use of the Internet and the viability of Internet-based services, which could harm our business.
In addition, the rapid and continual growth of traffic on the Internet has resulted at times in slow connection and download speeds among Internet users. Our business expansion may be harmed if the Internet infrastructure cannot handle our customers’ demands or if hosting capacity becomes insufficient. If our customers become frustrated with the speed at which they can utilize our products over the Internet, our customers may discontinue the use of our people development solutions and choose not to renew their contracts with us. Further, the performance of the Internet has also been adversely affected by viruses, worms, hacking, phishing attacks, denial of service attacks, and other similar malicious programs, as well as other forms of damage to portions of its infrastructure, which have resulted in a variety of Internet outages, interruptions, and other delays. These service interruptions could diminish the overall attractiveness of our products to existing and potential users and could cause demand for our products to suffer.
If for any reason we are not able to develop enhancements and new features, keep pace with technological developments, or respond to future disruptive technologies, our business will be harmed.
Our future success will depend on our ability to adapt and innovate. To attract new customers and increase revenue from existing customers, we will need to enhance and improve our existing products and introduce new features. The success of any enhancement or new feature depends on several factors, including timely completion, introduction, and market acceptance. If we are unable to enhance our existing products to meet customer needs or successfully develop or acquire new features or products, or if such new features or products fail to be successful, our business and operating results will be adversely affected.
In addition, because our products are designed to operate on a variety of network, hardware, and software platforms using Internet tools and protocols, we will need to continuously modify and enhance our products to keep pace with changes in internet-related hardware, software, communication, browser, and database technologies. If we are unable to respond in a timely and cost-effective manner to these rapid technological developments, our products may become less marketable and less competitive or obsolete, and our operating results may be negatively impacted.
Finally, our ability to grow is subject to the risk of future disruptive technologies. If new technologies emerge that are able to deliver a people development solutions at lower prices, more efficiently, or more conveniently, such technologies could adversely impact our ability to compete.
Certain of our operating results and financial metrics are difficult to predict as a result of seasonality.
We have historically experienced seasonality in terms of when we enter into customer agreements for our products. We sign a significantly higher percentage of agreements with new customers, and renewal agreements with existing customers, in the fourth quarter of each year. Within a given quarter, often a significant portion of our agreements are signed during the last two months of the quarter. This seasonality is reflected to a much lesser extent and sometimes is not immediately apparent in our revenue, due to the fact that we generally recognize subscription revenue over the term of the customer agreement, which is generally three years. We expect this seasonality to continue, which may cause fluctuations in certain of our operating results and financial metrics, and thus difficulties in predictability.
Even if demand for people development products and services increases generally, there is no guarantee that demand for SaaS products like ours will increase to a corresponding degree.
The widespread adoption of our products depends not only on strong demand for people development products and services generally, but also for products and services delivered via a SaaS business model in particular. There are still a significant number of organizations that have adopted no people development functions at all. It is unclear whether such organizations will ever adopt such functions and, if they do, whether they will desire a SaaS people development solution like ours. As a result, we cannot guarantee that our SaaS people development solutions will achieve and sustain the high level of market acceptance that is critical for the success of our business.
Integrated, comprehensive SaaS products such as ours represent a relatively recent approach to addressing organizations’ people development challenges, and we may be forced to change the prices and billing terms for our products, or our pricing model generally, as the market for these types of products evolves.
Providing organizations with applications to address their people development challenges through integrated, comprehensive SaaS products is a developing market that is still evolving. Some of our current competitors offer their products or services at a lower price or on different billing terms, which has resulted in pressures on our pricing and billing terms. Additionally, competitive dynamics may cause pricing levels, as well as billing terms and pricing models generally, to change further as the market matures and as existing and new market participants introduce new types of products and different approaches to enable organizations to address their people development needs. As a result, we may be forced to reduce the prices we charge for our products or the pricing model on which they are based, and may be unable to renew existing customer agreements or enter into new customer agreements at the same prices and upon the same terms that we have historically. If we are unable to maintain our pricing levels, billing terms, or pricing model, our operating results could be negatively impacted. In addition, pricing pressures, increased competition, and macroeconomic factors and events generally could result in reduced sales, reduced margins, losses or the failure of our products to achieve or maintain more widespread market acceptance, any of which could harm our business.
If we fail to develop our brand, our business may suffer.
We believe that developing and maintaining awareness of the Cornerstone OnDemand brand is critical to achieving widespread acceptance of our existing and future products and is an important element in attracting new customers. Furthermore, we believe that the importance of brand recognition will increase as competition in our market increases. Successful promotion of our brand will depend largely on the effectiveness of our marketing efforts and on our ability to provide reliable and useful services at competitive prices. Brand promotion activities may not yield increased revenue, and even if they do, any increased revenue may not offset the expenses we incurred in building our brand. In addition, the Cornerstone OnDemand Foundation shares our company name and any negative perceptions of any kind about the Foundation could adversely affect our brand and reputation. If we fail to successfully promote and maintain our brand, or incur substantial expenses in an unsuccessful attempt to promote and maintain our brand, we may fail to attract enough new customers or retain our existing customers to the extent necessary to realize a sufficient return on our brand-building efforts, and our business could suffer.
Our sales to government entities are subject to a number of additional challenges and risks.
We sell to US federal and state and foreign governmental agency customers, and we may increase sales to government entities in the future. The additional risks and challenges associated with doing business with governmental entities include, but are not limited to, the following:
•Selling to governmental entities can be more competitive, expensive, and time-consuming than selling to private entities, often requiring significant upfront time and expense without any assurance that these efforts will generate a sale;
•Government certification requirements may change, or we may lose one or more government certifications, such as the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program, and in doing so restrict our ability to sell into the government sector until we have attained revised certificates;
•Governmental entities may have significant leverage in negotiations, thereby enabling such entities to demand contract terms that differ from what we generally agree to in our standard agreements, including, for example, most favored nation clauses and terms allowing contract termination for convenience;
•Government demand and payment for our products may be influenced by public sector budgetary cycles and funding authorizations, with funding reductions or delays, resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic or otherwise, having an adverse impact on public sector demand for our products; and
•Government contracts are generally subject to audits and investigations, which we have limited experience with, potentially resulting in termination of contracts, refund of a portion of fees received, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines, and suspensions or debarment from future government business.
To the extent that we become more reliant on contracts with government entities in the future, our exposure to such risks and challenges could increase, which, in turn, could adversely impact our business.
Risks Related to COVID-19
Our operations and employees face risks related to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, that could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results. The COVID-19 pandemic could materially affect our operations, including at our headquarters and/or anywhere else we operate, and the business or operations of our customers, suppliers, partners, or other third parties with whom we conduct business.
Our business has been and we expect will continue to be adversely impacted by the effects of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, which has and could continue to cause disruption in the operations of our customers and the suppliers, partners, and other third-parties upon whom we rely. Our headquarters and many of our employees are located in Los Angeles County, California, which has been severely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Officials in Los Angeles County and elsewhere have issued multiple orders to implement various precautions intended to slow the spread of COVID-19, including prohibitions on large gatherings and directives related to social distancing and closure of non-essential or non-critical business at physical locations. Authorities in many other states and cities where our customers, suppliers, and partners are located have issued orders with similar goals and restrictions. While some of these restrictions have been lifted or relaxed in certain areas, the COVID-19 pandemic continues to present serious health risks and there is no guarantee when or if all such restrictions will be eliminated, such that we and our customers, suppliers, and partners will be able to safely resume operations consistent with our pre-COVID-19 operations.
In response to the serious risk posed by the COVID-19 pandemic and to comply with applicable governmental orders, we have substantially closed our headquarters in Santa Monica, California, along with our other domestic and international offices, asked all of our employees to work from home, and cancelled non-essential business-related travel. These and other operational changes we have implemented may negatively impact productivity and disrupt our business. Additionally, in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic, our suppliers and partners may be unable fulfill their obligations to us in a timely manner or at all. Further, to the extent our customers’ operations have been and continue to be negatively impacted, they may delay payments to us, request payment or other concessions, elect not to renew their agreements with us in a timely manner or at all, or reduce their spending level on our products and services. While we have not had a material impact to date in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic, we continue to experience lengthening of sales cycles, reduced renewal rates and customer spending (which had an impact on our net annual dollar retention rate in 2020), delayed payments, and requests for extensions of payment terms from certain customers. The COVID-19 pandemic may have an impact on our revenue in the near term.
The extent of the effect of COVID-19, or any future health crisis, on our operational and financial performance, and on our relationships with suppliers, partners, and customers, will depend on future developments, including the duration, spread and intensity of the pandemic, the effect of approved vaccines, and the speed and extent to which they are distributed and taken, all of which are uncertain and difficult to predict considering the rapidly evolving landscape. As a result, it is not currently possible to ascertain the overall impact of COVID-19 on our business. If the pandemic continues to persist as a severe worldwide health crisis, the pandemic could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.
Risks Related to Acquisitions
Failure to integrate our business and operations successfully with those of Saba in the expected time-frame or otherwise may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.
We do not have a substantial history of acquiring other large companies and have never completed an acquisition of the size and complexity of Saba. The success of our acquisition of Saba will depend, in substantial part, on our ability to integrate Saba's business and operations successfully with ours and to realize fully the anticipated benefits and potential synergies from combining our companies, including, among others: cost savings from eliminating duplicative functions; operational efficiencies in research and development investments; and revenue growth resulting from the addition of Saba’s product portfolio into our pre-acquisition product portfolio and “cross-selling” additional products to Saba customers. If we are unable to achieve these objectives, the anticipated benefits and potential synergies from the acquisition may not be realized fully or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected. Any failure to timely realize these anticipated benefits could have an adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition.
We completed our acquisition of Saba in April 2020 and are still actively engaged in the integration process. In connection with the integration process, we could experience the loss of key employees, loss of key customers, decreases in revenues, and increases in operating costs, as well as the disruption of our ongoing businesses, any or all of which could limit our ability to achieve the anticipated benefits and potential synergies from the acquisition and have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition.
The additional scale of the combined company's operations, together with the complexity of the integration effort, including integration of critical information technology systems, as well as combining other financial, human resources, and administrative processes, may adversely affect our ability to report financial results on a timely basis. The acquisition may necessitate significant modifications to our internal control systems, processes, and information systems, both during the transition and over the longer-term as we fully integrate the combined company, particularly in light of the fact that Saba (as a private company) was not previously required to report on its internal control over financial reporting. Due to the complexity of the acquisition, we cannot be certain that our internal control over financial reporting will be effective for any period, or on an ongoing basis, nor can we be certain that changes to our internal controls or the design and implementation of new internal controls will not be required. If we are unable to accurately report our financial results in a timely manner or are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, our business, financial condition, and results of operations, and the market perception thereof, may be materially adversely affected.
As we have in the past, we may seek to acquire or invest in other companies or technologies, which could divert our management’s attention, result in additional dilution to our stockholders, or otherwise disrupt our operations and harm our operating results.
As we have in the past, we may seek to acquire or invest in other businesses, products, or technologies that we believe could complement or expand our existing solutions, enhance our technical capabilities, lead to cost synergies, or otherwise offer growth opportunities. Most recently, in April 2020, we acquired Saba, a provider of talent experience solutions, for an aggregate purchase price of $1.310 billion, consisting of $1.277 billion in cash consideration (net of cash acquired) and 1,110,352 shares of our common stock with an aggregate value of $32.9 million. The pursuit of other potential acquisitions, along with the work required to successfully integrate the businesses we acquire, may divert the attention of management, result in additional dilution, and cause us to incur various expenses in identifying, investigating, and pursuing suitable acquisitions, whether or not they are ultimately consummated.
When acquiring other businesses, we may not be able to successfully integrate the personnel, operations, and technologies of any businesses that we have acquired or may acquire in the future or effectively manage the combined business following the acquisition. We may also not achieve the anticipated benefits from other acquired businesses due to a number of factors, including:
•unanticipated costs or liabilities associated with the acquisition;
•incurrence of acquisition-related and integration expenses or tax impacts, some or all of which might be unanticipated;
•ineffective or inadequate controls, procedures, or policies at the acquired company;
•diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns;
•failure to realize synergies in a timely fashion or at all;
•harm to our existing relationships with customers, distributors, and partners, including as a result of competing in the markets in which such parties operate;
•inability to maintain relationships with key customers, distributors, and partners of the acquired business;
•the potential loss of key employees and customers;
•potential unknown liabilities or risks associated with the acquired businesses, including those arising from existing contractual obligations or litigation matters;
•exposure to claims and disputes by third parties, including intellectual property claims and disputes;
•the use of resources that might be used in other parts of our business; and
•the use of substantial portions of our available cash to consummate the acquisition.
In addition, a significant portion of the purchase price of companies we acquire may be allocated to acquired goodwill or intangible assets which must be assessed for impairment at least annually or upon certain triggering events. In the future, if our acquisitions do not yield expected returns, we may be required to take charges to our operating results based on this impairment assessment process, which could harm our operating results.
Other future acquisitions could also result in dilutive issuances of equity securities or the incurrence of debt, which could adversely affect our operating results. For example, as noted above, in connection with the acquisition of Saba, we issued 1,110,352 shares of our common stock and incurred approximately $1.0047 billion of indebtedness. In addition, if an acquired business fails to meet our expectations, our operating results, business, and financial condition may suffer.
Risks Related to Information Technology Upon Which We Rely
Our systems collect, access, use, and store personal and other customer proprietary information. As a result, we are subject to security risks and are required to invest significant resources to prevent, mitigate, or correct issues arising from potential or actual security breaches. If a security breach occurs, our reputation could be harmed, our business may suffer, and we could incur significant liability.
Our people development solutions involve the storage and transmission of customers’ sensitive, proprietary, and confidential information, including personal information, over the Internet (including public networks). Our security measures may be breached as a result of efforts by individuals or groups of hackers and sophisticated organizations, including state-sponsored organizations or nation-states. Our security measures could also be compromised by employee error or malfeasance, which could result in someone obtaining unauthorized access to, or denying authorized access to our IT systems, our customers’ data or our data, including our intellectual property and other confidential business information. Additionally, third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or customers into disclosing sensitive information such as user names, passwords, or other information to gain access to our customers’ data, our data, or our IT systems. A security breach or other security incident of our IT systems, customer data, website, data or app, or those of one of our vendors, partners or other third parties, has occurred in the past, and may occur in the future. For example, in January 2021, an unauthorized party gained access to a separate, legacy application of ours and gained access to the names, email addresses, and training records of approximately three dozen customers. We took appropriate steps to respond to this incident and implemented remedial actions designed to protect against similar issues in the future.
Such breaches and other incidents can result in a risk of unauthorized, unlawful, or inappropriate access to, denial of access to, disclosure of, or loss of our customers’ or our sensitive, proprietary, and confidential information, as well as damage to our IT systems and our ability to make required reporting and disclosures as a public company. An actual or perceived security breach or similar incident could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition due to loss of confidence in the security of our products, or result in damage to our reputation, early termination of contracts, decline in sales, disruption to our operations, litigation, regulatory investigations and penalties, or other liabilities.
In particular, federal, state, and foreign governments continue to adopt new, or modify existing, laws requiring companies and their service providers to maintain certain security measures or to report data breaches to government authorities or affected individuals. In turn, customers’ expectations for the security measures we implement have increased. If we experience security breaches that could have been prevented by measures required by these laws or our customer contracts, or fail to report security breaches within timeframes mandated by law or our customer contracts, we could face significant liability.
Techniques to compromise IT systems have become more complex over time and are often not identified until they are exploited. As a result, we may be unable to anticipate or prevent such techniques. Our products operate in conjunction with and are dependent on a broad range of products, components, and third-party services, and a vulnerability in any of them can expose us to a security breach. In addition, our customers and their third-party service providers may not have adequate security measures in place to protect their data that is stored in our solutions, and because we do not control our customers or their service providers, we cannot prevent vulnerabilities in their security measures from being exploited.
Our efforts to detect, prevent, and remediate known or potential security vulnerabilities, including those arising from third-party hardware or software, may result in additional direct and indirect costs.
Finally, if a high-profile security breach occurs with respect to another SaaS provider, our customers and potential customers may lose trust in the security of the SaaS business model generally, which could adversely impact our ability to retain existing customers or attract new ones.
We rely on third-party computer hardware and software that may be difficult to replace or could cause errors or failures of our service.
In addition to the software we develop, we rely on computer hardware, purchased or leased, and software licensed from third parties in order to deliver our solutions. This hardware and software may not continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. Any loss of the right to use any of this hardware or software could result in delays in our ability to provide our solutions until equivalent technology is either developed by us or, if available, identified, obtained, and integrated. In addition, errors or defects in third-party hardware or software used in our solutions could result in errors or a failure of our products, which could harm our business.
If we fail to manage our SaaS hosting network infrastructure capacity, our existing customers may experience service outages and our new customers may experience delays in the deployment of our people development solutions.
We have experienced significant growth in the number of users, transactions, and data that our hosting infrastructure supports. We seek to maintain sufficient excess capacity in our SaaS hosting network infrastructure to meet the needs of all of our customers. We also seek to maintain excess capacity to facilitate the rapid provision of new customer deployments and the expansion of existing customer deployments. However, the provision of new hosting infrastructure requires significant lead time. If we do not accurately predict our infrastructure capacity requirements, our existing customers may experience service outages that may subject us to financial penalties, financial liabilities, and customer losses. If our hosting infrastructure capacity fails to keep pace with increased sales, customers may experience delays as we seek to obtain additional capacity, which could harm our reputation and adversely affect our revenue growth.
Any significant disruption in our SaaS hosting network infrastructure could harm our reputation, require us to provide credits or refunds, result in early terminations of customer agreements or a loss of customers, and adversely affect our business.
Our SaaS hosting network infrastructure is a critical part of our business operations. Our customers access our people development solutions through a standard web browser and depend on us for fast and reliable access to our products. Our software is proprietary, and we currently rely on four third-party data center hosting facilities, which we lease, and the expertise of members of our engineering and software development teams for the continued performance of our solutions. We are in the process of migrating our solutions from our leased data center hosting facilities to public cloud third-party data center providers. After we complete this migration, we will rely extensively on these public cloud providers to provide our customers and their users with fast and reliable access to our products. Any disruption of or interference with our SaaS hosting network infrastructure, including the services and operations of the public cloud providers, could harm our reputation, business, and results of operations. We have experienced, and may in the future experience, disruptions in our computing and communications infrastructure. Factors that may cause such disruptions that may harm our reputation include:
•human error;
•security breaches;
•telecommunications outages from third-party providers;
•computer viruses;
•acts of terrorism, sabotage, or other intentional acts of vandalism, including cyber attacks;
•unforeseen interruption or damages experienced in moving hardware to a new location;
•fire, earthquake, flood, and other natural disasters; and
•power loss.
Although we generally back-up our customer databases hourly, store our data in more than one geographically distinct location at least weekly, and perform real-time mirroring of data to disaster recovery locations, we do not currently offer immediate access to disaster recovery locations in the event of a disaster or major outage. Thus, in the event of any of the factors described above, or certain other failures of our computing infrastructure, customers may not be able to access their data for 24 hours or more and there is a remote chance that customer data from recent transactions may be permanently lost or otherwise compromised. In addition, we may not have adequate insurance coverage to compensate for losses from a major interruption. Moreover, some of our agreements include performance guarantees and service level standards that obligate us to provide credits, refunds or termination rights in the event of a significant disruption in our SaaS hosting network infrastructure or other technical problems that relate to the functionality or design of our solutions.
Risks Related to Our Reliance on Third Parties
Our growth depends in part on the success of our strategic relationships with third parties.
We anticipate that we will continue to depend on various third-party relationships in order to grow our business. In addition to growing our indirect sales channels, we intend to pursue additional relationships with other third parties, such as technology and content providers and implementation consultants. Identifying, negotiating, and documenting relationships with third parties requires significant time and resources, as does integrating third-party content and technology. Our agreements with distributors and providers of technology, content, and consulting services are typically non-exclusive and do not prohibit them from working with our competitors or from offering competing services. Our competitors may be effective in providing incentives to third parties to favor their products or services or to prevent or reduce subscriptions to our products. In addition, these distributors and providers may not perform as expected under our agreements, and we have had and may in the future have, disagreements or disputes with such distributors and providers, which could negatively affect our brand and reputation. A global economic slowdown could also adversely affect the businesses of our distributors and it is possible that they may not be able to devote the resources we expect to our relationships with such distributors.
If we are unsuccessful in establishing or maintaining our relationships with these third parties, our ability to compete in the marketplace or to grow our revenue could be impaired and our operating results could suffer. Even if we are successful, we cannot guarantee that these relationships will result in improved operating results.
We rely significantly on implementation partners to deliver professional services to our customers, and if these implementation partners fail to deliver these professional services effectively, or if we are unable to incentivize new partners to service our customers, our operating results will be harmed.
We rely significantly on various partners to assist us in the successful implementation of our products and to optimize our customers’ use of our products during the terms of their engagements. We provide our implementation partners with specific training and programs to assist them in servicing our customers, but there can be no assurance that these steps will be utilized or effective. If these partners fail to deliver these services to our customers in an effective and timely manner, we may suffer reputational harm and our results of operations may be adversely impacted. We also may not be able to incentivize new partners to service our customers. If we are unable to maintain our existing relationships or enter into new ones, we would have to devote substantially more resources to delivering our professional services. If we fail to effectively manage our implementation partners, our ability to sell our products and subscriptions and our operating results will be harmed.
Failure to effectively manage customer deployments by our third-party service providers could adversely impact our business.
In cases where our third-party service providers are engaged either by us or by a customer directly to deploy a product for a customer, our third-party service providers need to have a substantial understanding of such customer’s business so they can configure the product in a manner that complements its existing business processes and integrates the product into its existing systems. It may be difficult for us to manage the timeliness of these deployments and the allocation of personnel and resources by our customers. Failure to successfully manage customer deployments by us or our third-party service providers could harm our reputation and cause us to lose existing customers, face potential customer disputes, or limit the rate at which new customers purchase our products.
Risks Related to Our Financial Results and Need for Additional Capital
Our financial results may fluctuate due to our long, variable and, therefore, unpredictable sales cycle and our focus on large and mid-market organizations.
We plan our expenses based on certain assumptions about the length and variability of our sales cycle. If our sales cycle becomes longer or more variable, our results may be adversely affected. Our sales cycle generally varies in duration from two to nine months and, in some cases, much longer depending on the size of the potential customer. Factors that may influence the length and variability of our sales cycle include among others:
•the need to educate potential customers about the uses and benefits of our products;
•the relatively long duration of the commitment customers make in their agreements with us;
•the discretionary nature of potential customers’ purchasing and budget cycles and decisions;
•the competitive nature of potential customers’ evaluation and purchasing processes;
•the lengthy purchasing approval processes of potential customers;
•the evolving functionality demands of potential customers;
•fluctuations in the people development needs of potential customers;
•announcements or planned introductions of new products by us or our competitors; and
•macroeconomic factors, such as the evolving COVID-19 pandemic.
The fluctuations that result from the length and variability of our sales cycle may be magnified by our focus on sales to large and mid-sized organizations. If we are unable to close an expected significant transaction with one or more of these companies in a particular period, or if an expected transaction is delayed until a subsequent period, our operating results for that period, and for any future periods in which revenue from such transaction would otherwise have been recognized, may be adversely affected.
Servicing our debt will require a significant amount of cash, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
Our ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of, to pay interest on, or to refinance our indebtedness, including our Convertible Notes due March 17, 2023 with an aggregate principal amount of $300.0 million, and the Term Loan Facility due April 22, 2027 with an aggregate principal amount of $1.0047 billion, depends on our future performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive, and other factors beyond our control. Our business may not generate cash flow from operations in the future sufficient to satisfy our obligations under the Term Loan Facility, the Convertible Notes, or any future indebtedness we may incur; or to make necessary capital expenditures. If we are unable to generate such cash flow, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as reducing or delaying investments or capital expenditures, selling assets, refinancing, or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive. Our ability to refinance the Convertible Notes, the Term Loan Facility, or future indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. We may not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms, which could result in a default on the Convertible Notes, the Term Loan Facility, or future indebtedness.
Further, with certain exceptions, upon a change of control the holders of our Convertible Notes may require that we repurchase all or part of such notes at a purchase price equal to the principal amount plus the total sum of all remaining scheduled interest payments through the remainder of the term of such notes. In such event we may not have enough cash available or be able to obtain financing to repurchase the Convertible Notes, and our ability to repurchase the Convertible Notes may be limited by law, regulatory authority, or agreements governing our other indebtedness.
We may require additional capital to support business growth, and this capital may not be available on acceptable terms, if at all.
We intend to continue to make investments to support our business growth and may seek additional funds to respond to business challenges, including the need to develop new features or enhance our existing products, improve our operating infrastructure, or acquire complementary businesses and technologies. Accordingly, we may need to engage in additional equity or debt financings to secure additional funds. For example, we incurred $1.0047 billion of additional indebtedness and issued 1,110,352 shares of our common stock to finance the acquisition of Saba, which was completed in April 2020. If we raise additional funds through issuances of equity or debt securities, our existing stockholders could suffer significant dilution, and any new equity securities we issue could have rights, preferences, and privileges superior to those of holders of our common stock. Any debt financing secured by us in the future could involve restrictive covenants relating to our capital raising activities and other financial and operational matters, which may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital and to pursue business opportunities, including potential acquisitions. In addition, we may not be able to obtain additional financing on terms favorable to us, if at all. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us, when we require it, our ability to continue to support our business growth and to respond to business challenges could be significantly impaired.
Further, the indenture governing the Convertible Notes and the Term Loan Facility includes restrictive covenants that, subject to specified exceptions and parameters, limit our ability to incur additional debt, and the Term Loan Facility includes additional restrictive covenants that limit, subject to specific exceptions and parameters, our ability to make investments or acquisitions, declare dividends, or take certain other corporate actions. As a result, we may be unable to take advantage of strategic or business development opportunities as they arise, or we may not be able to react to market conditions, if we are restricted in our ability to raise debt financing, or we may be required to seek alternative means to generate cash, including by selling assets, refinancing or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive, if available at all.
Our financial results may fluctuate due to various business factors, some of which may be beyond our control.
There are a number of other factors that may cause our financial results to fluctuate from period to period, including among others:
•changes in billing terms and collection cycles in customer agreements;
•the extent to which new customers are attracted to our products to satisfy their people development needs;
•the timing and rate at which we sign agreements with new customers;
•our access to service providers and partners when we outsource customer service projects;
•our ability to manage the quality and completion of the customer implementations performed by partners;
•the timing and duration of our customer implementations, which is often outside of our direct control;
•our ability to provide, or partner with effective partners to provide, resources for customer implementations and consulting projects;
•the extent to which we retain existing customers and satisfy their requirements;
•the extent to which existing customers renew their subscriptions to our products and the timing of those renewals;
•the extent to which existing customers purchase or discontinue the use of additional products and add or decrease the number of users;
•the extent to which our customers request enhancements to underlying features and functionality of our products, and the timing of our delivery of these enhancements to our customers;
•the addition or loss of large customers, including through acquisitions or consolidations;
•the number and size of new customers, as well as the number and size of renewal customers in a particular period;
•the mix of customers among large, mid-sized, and small organizations;
•changes in our pricing policies or those of our competitors;
•seasonal factors affecting demand for our products or potential customers’ purchasing decisions;
•the financial condition and creditworthiness of our customers;
•the amount and timing of our operating expenses, including those related to the maintenance, expansion, and restructuring of our business, operations, and infrastructure;
•changes in the operational efficiency of our business;
•the timing and success of synergy realization resulting from integration of acquired companies, such as Saba;
•the timing and success of our new product and service introductions;
•the timing of expenses of the development of new products and technologies, including enhancements to our products;
•our ability to aggregate large data sets into meaningful insights to drive increased demand for our products;
•continued strong demand for people development in the US and globally;
•the success of current and new competitive products and services by our competitors;
•other changes in the competitive dynamics of our industry, including consolidation among competitors, customers, or strategic partners;
•our ability to manage our existing business and future growth, including in terms of additional headcount, additional customers, incremental users, and new geographic regions;
•expenses related to our network and data centers, and the expansion of such networks and data centers;
•the effects of, and expenses associated with, acquisitions of third-party technologies or businesses and any potential future charges for impairment of goodwill resulting from those acquisitions;
•equity issuances, including as consideration in acquisitions or due to the conversion of our outstanding Convertible Notes;
•business disruptions, costs, and events related to shareholder activism;
•legal or political changes in local or foreign jurisdictions that decrease demand for, or restrict our ability to sell or provide, our products;
•fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, including any fluctuation caused by uncertainties relating to UK’s exit from the EU, commonly referred to as Brexit;
•general economic, industry, and market conditions, including in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic; and
•various factors related to disruptions in our SaaS hosting network infrastructure, defects in our products, privacy and data security considerations, and exchange rate fluctuations, each of which is described elsewhere in these risk factors.
In light of the foregoing factors, we believe that our financial results, including our revenue, operating income, and free cash flows may vary significantly from period-to-period. As a result, period-to-period comparisons of our operating results may not be meaningful and should not be relied on as an indication of future performance.
Because we generally recognize subscription revenue from our customers over the terms of their agreements but incur most costs associated with generating such agreements upfront, rapid growth in our customer base may put downward pressure on our operating margin in the short term.
The expenses associated with generating customer agreements are generally incurred up front but the resulting subscription revenue is generally recognized over the life of the agreements; therefore, increased growth in the number of our customers will result in our recognition of more costs than revenue during the early periods covered by such agreements, even in cases where the agreements are expected to be profitable for us over their full terms.
We have a history of losses, and we cannot be certain that we will achieve or sustain profitability.
We have a history of losses. We experienced net losses of $40.0 million, $4.1 million, and $33.8 million in 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. At December 31, 2020, our accumulated deficit was $564.7 million and total stockholders’ equity was $268.9 million. It is possible that we may continue to incur operating losses in the future as a result of expenses associated with the continued development and expansion of our business as well as borrowing costs on our substantial indebtedness. Our expenses include among others, sales and marketing, research and development, consulting and support services, costs related to our acquisitions and the integration of businesses we acquire, and other costs related to the development, marketing, and sale and service of our products that may not generate revenue until later periods, if at all. Any failure to increase revenue or manage our cost structure as we implement initiatives to grow our business could prevent us from sustaining profitability. In addition, our ability to achieve sustained profitability is subject to a number of the risks and uncertainties discussed below, many of which are beyond our control. We cannot be certain that we will be able to sustain profitability on a quarterly or annual basis.
Risks Related to Compliance with Laws
Existing or future laws and regulations relating to privacy or data security could increase the cost of our products, limit their use and adoption, and subject us or our customers to litigation, regulatory investigations and penalties, and other potential liabilities.
Our people development solutions enable our customers to collect, manage, and store a wide range of data, including personal data, related to every phase of the employee performance and management cycle. The US and various state governments have adopted or proposed laws governing the collection, use, storage, sharing, and processing of personal data. Several foreign jurisdictions, including but not limited to the EU and its member states, the UK, Korea, Japan, Singapore, Australia, and India, have adopted legislation (including directives or regulations) that increase or change the requirements governing the personal data of individuals in these jurisdictions. In some cases, these laws impose obligations not only on many of our customers, but also directly on us. These laws and regulations are complex and change frequently, at times due to differing economic conditions and changes in political climate, with new laws and regulations proposed frequently and existing laws and regulations subject to different and conflicting interpretations. These laws have the potential to increase costs of compliance, risks of noncompliance and penalties for noncompliance, and the cost and complexity of selling and delivering our solutions.
For example, the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), which took effect on May 25, 2018, imposes obligations on our customers and directly on us. Among other obligations under the GDPR, we are required to: give more detailed disclosure about how we collect, use, and share personal data; contractually commit to data protection measures in our contracts with customers; maintain adequate data security measures; notify regulators and affected individuals of certain personal data breaches; meet extensive privacy governance and documentation requirements; and honor individuals’ expanded data protection rights, including their rights to access, correct, and delete their personal data. Companies that violate the GDPR can face fines of up to the greater of 20 million euros or 4% of their worldwide annual revenue, and restrictions on data processing. Our customers’ failure to comply with the GDPR could lead to significant fines imposed by regulators or restrictions on our ability to process personal information as needed to provide our services. We may also be obligated to assist our customers with their own compliance obligations under the GDPR.
Further, the GDPR and other European data protection laws restrict the transfer of personal information from Europe to the United States and most other countries unless the parties to the transfer have implemented specific compliance mechanisms. One of the mechanisms on which we previously relied, the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework, was invalidated by the Court of Justice of the European Union in a July 2020 decision. The decision also called into question whether companies can lawfully use the European Commission’s Standard Contractual Clauses as a compliance mechanism for transfers of personal data from Europe to the United States or most other countries. Authorities in Switzerland also have issued guidance calling the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework inadequate and raising similar questions about the Standard Contractual Clauses. At present, there are few, if any, viable alternatives to the Standard Contractual Clauses, on which we have relied, including for transfers to India, where we maintain a significant support center. If we are unable to implement sufficient safeguards to ensure that our transfers of personal information from Europe are lawful, we will face increased exposure to regulatory actions, substantial fines, and injunctions against processing personal information from Europe. We also rely on the European Commission’s recognition of Canada, Israel, and New Zealand, where we maintain significant support centers, as providing an “adequate” level of protection for personal data transferred from Europe to those countries. Loss of our ability to lawfully transfer personal data out of Europe to these or any other jurisdictions may cause reluctance or refusal by current or prospective European customers to use our products, and we may be required to increase our data processing capabilities in Europe at significant expense. Additionally, other countries outside of Europe have passed or are considering passing laws requiring local data residency, which could increase the cost and complexity of delivering our services.
Further, Brexit has created uncertainty with regard to data protection regulation in the UK, where our operations involve the processing of EU residents’ personal data. In particular, as a result of Brexit, it is unclear whether, the UK will enact data protection legislation equivalent to the GDPR and how data transfers to and from the UK will be regulated. Thus, it is uncertain whether our operations in, and data transfers to and from, the UK can comply with UK and EU law.
Privacy and data security laws in the US are also increasingly complex and changing rapidly. Many states have enacted laws requiring companies to implement reasonable data security measures, and laws in all states and US territories require businesses to notify affected individuals and governmental entities of the occurrence of certain security breaches affecting personal information. These laws are not consistent, and compliance with them in the event of a widespread data breach may be complex and costly. States have also begun to introduce more comprehensive privacy legislation. Just over a month after the GDPR took effect, the California legislature passed the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“CCPA”), which took effect on January 1, 2020. The CCPA gives California residents certain rights similar to the individual rights given under the GDPR, including the right to access and delete their personal information, opt-out of certain personal information sharing, and receive detailed information about how their personal information is used. The CCPA prohibits discrimination against individuals who exercise their privacy rights, provides for civil penalties for violations, and creates a private right of action for data breaches that is expected to increase data breach litigation. Since the enactment of the CCPA, new privacy and data security laws have been proposed in more than half of the US states and in the US Congress, reflecting a trend toward more stringent privacy legislation in the US. The CCPA itself will expand substantially when the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020 (the “CPRA”), which California voters approved in November 2020, takes effect on January 1, 2023. The CPRA will, among other things, restrict use of certain categories of sensitive personal information that we handle; further restrict the sharing of personal information; establish restrictions on the retention of personal information; expand the types of data breaches subject to the private right of action; and establish the California Privacy Protection Agency to implement and enforce the new law, as well as impose administrative fines.
The costs of compliance with, and other burdens imposed by, privacy and data security laws and regulations may limit the use and adoption of our services, lead to negative publicity, reduce overall demand for our services, make it more difficult to meet expectations of or commitments to customers, require us to take on more onerous obligations in our contracts with customers, lead to significant fines, penalties or liabilities for noncompliance, or slow the pace at which we close sales transactions, any of which could harm our business. These laws could also impact our ability to offer, or our customers’ ability to deploy, our services in certain locations. The costs, burdens, and potential liabilities imposed by existing privacy laws could be compounded if other jurisdictions in the US or abroad begin to adopt similar laws.
In addition to government activity, privacy advocacy and other industry groups have established, or may establish, new self-regulatory standards that may place additional burdens on our ability to provide our services globally. Our customers expect us to meet voluntary certifications and other standards established by third parties, such as ISO 27001 and ISO 27701. If we are unable to earn and maintain these certifications or meet these standards, it could adversely affect our ability to provide our solutions to certain customers and could harm our business.
Furthermore, concerns regarding data privacy and security may cause our customers’ customers, members, employees, or other stakeholders to resist providing the data necessary to allow our customers to use our services effectively. Even the perception that the privacy of personal information is not satisfactorily protected or does not meet regulatory requirements could inhibit sales of our products or services and could limit adoption of our cloud-based solutions.
Any of these matters could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, or operational results.
We are subject to governmental export and import controls that could impair our ability to compete in international markets due to licensing requirements and subject us to liability if we are not in full compliance with applicable laws.
Our products are subject to export controls, including the Commerce Department’s Export Administration Regulations and various economic and trade sanctions regulations established by the Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Controls, and exports of our products must be made in compliance with these laws. If we fail to comply with these US export control laws and import laws, including US Customs regulations, we and certain of our employees could be subject to: substantial civil or criminal penalties, including the possible loss of export or import privileges; fines, which may be imposed on us and responsible employees or managers; and, in extreme cases, the incarceration of responsible employees or managers. In addition, if our distributors fail to obtain appropriate import, export, or re-export licenses or authorizations, we may also be adversely affected through reputational harm and penalties. Obtaining the necessary authorizations, including any required license, for a particular sale may be time-consuming and is not guaranteed, and may result in the delay or loss of sales opportunities. Furthermore, the US export control laws and economic sanctions laws prohibit the shipment of certain products and services to US embargoed or sanctioned countries, governments, and persons. Even though we take precautions to prevent our products from being provided to US sanctions targets, our products and services could be delivered to those targets or provided by our distributors despite such precautions. Any such shipment could have negative consequences, including government investigations, penalties, and reputational harm. In addition, various countries regulate the import of certain encryption technology, including through import permitting or licensing requirements, and have enacted laws that could limit our ability to distribute our products or could limit our customers’ ability to implement our products in those countries. Changes to our products or changes in export and import regulations may create delays in the introduction and sale of our products in international markets, prevent our customers with international operations from deploying our products or, in some cases, prevent the export or import of our products to certain countries, governments or persons altogether. Any change in export or import regulations, economic sanctions or related laws, shift in the enforcement or scope of existing regulations, or change in the countries, governments, persons, or technologies targeted by such regulations, could result in decreased use of our products, or in our decreased ability to export or sell our products to existing or potential customers with international operations. Any decreased use of our products or limitation on our ability to export or sell our products would likely adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results.
Risks Related to International Operations
Fluctuations in the exchange rate of foreign currencies could result in foreign currency gains and losses.
We conduct our business in various countries across the world. As we continue to expand our international operations, we will become more exposed to the effects of fluctuations in currency exchange rates. This exposure is the result of selling in multiple currencies and operating in foreign countries where the functional currency is the local currency. Further, our overseas subsidiaries’ results are also impacted by exchange rates affecting the carrying value of US dollar denominated intercompany loans with us. Because we conduct business in currencies other than US dollars, but report our results of operations in US dollars, fluctuations in the exchange rates of these foreign currencies, including any fluctuations caused by uncertainties following Brexit, may hinder our ability to predict our future results and earnings and materially impact our business, financial condition, and operating results. Due to our legal structure and the currencies in which we operate, any fluctuations in the exchange rates of the British pound may be particularly impactful. Additionally, the impact of fluctuations may not be immediately apparent in the constant currency results we present, because we present these results based on prior period exchange rates. We may engage in foreign currency hedging. When we hedge our foreign currency exposure, we may not be able to completely eliminate the impact of fluctuations in the exchange rates.
We currently have a number of international offices and may expand our international operations. Doing business internationally has unique risks with respect to operational execution and regulatory compliance.
We currently have international offices in several countries, and we may expand our international operations into other countries in the future. If we invest substantial time and resources to expand our international operations and are unable to do so successfully, our business and operating results will suffer. Conducting our business internationally, particularly with expansion into countries in which we have limited experience, subjects us to a variety of risks that that we do not necessarily face to the same degree in the US. These risks may lead to a decreased demand for, or restrict our ability to sell or provide, our products, and include, among others:
•unexpected changes in regulatory requirements, taxes, trade laws, tariffs, export quotas, custom duties, or other trade restrictions;
•differing labor regulations;
•regulations relating to data security and the unauthorized use of, or access to, commercial and personal information;
•potential penalties or other adverse consequences for violations of anti-corruption, anti-bribery, and other similar laws and regulations, including the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”) and the UK Bribery Act;
•greater difficulty in supporting and localizing our products;
•unrest and/or changes in a specific country’s or region’s social, political, legal, health, or economic conditions, including in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic;
•challenges inherent in efficiently managing an increased number of employees over large geographic distances, including the need to implement appropriate systems, controls, policies, benefits, and compliance programs;
•currency exchange rate fluctuations including any fluctuations caused by uncertainties following Brexit;
•limited or unfavorable intellectual property protection;
•competition with companies or other services that understand local markets better than we do;
•increased financial accounting and reporting burdens, and complexities associated with implementing and maintaining adequate internal controls; and
•restrictions on repatriation of earnings.
Our operations could be materially affected by changes in domestic and foreign economic, political, or legal conditions. For example, we are continuing to monitor developments related to Brexit, which occurred at the end of December 2020 and could have significant implications for our business. Lack of clarity about future UK laws and regulations as the UK determines which EU rules and regulations to replace or replicate, including financial laws and regulations, tax and free trade agreements, intellectual property rights, supply chain logistics, environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, immigration laws, and employment laws, could decrease foreign direct investment in the UK, increase costs, depress economic activity, and restrict access to capital. The political and economic instability created by Brexit has also caused and may continue to cause significant volatility in global financial markets and the value of the British pound currency or other currencies, including the euro, and due to our legal structure, any fluctuations in the exchange rates of the British pound may be particularly impactful.
Such a withdrawal from the EU is unprecedented. It is unclear how the UK’s access to the European single market for goods, capital, services, and labor within the EU, or single market, and the wider commercial, legal, and regulatory environment, will impact our UK operations and customers. Our UK operations service customers in the UK as well as in other countries in the EU and the European Economic Area (“EEA”), and these operations could be disrupted by Brexit, particularly if there is a change in the UK’s relationship to the single market.
We may also face new regulatory costs and challenges that could have an adverse effect on our operations. For example, the UK could lose the benefits of global trade agreements negotiated by the EU on behalf of its members, which may result in increased trade barriers that could make doing business in the EU and the EEA more difficult.
Risks Related to Intellectual Property
If we fail to adequately protect our proprietary rights, our competitive advantage and brand could be impaired and we may lose valuable assets, generate reduced revenue, and incur costly litigation to protect our rights.
Our success is dependent, in part, upon protecting our proprietary technology. We rely on a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks, service marks, trade secret laws, and contractual restrictions to establish and protect our proprietary rights in our products and services. However, the steps we take to protect our intellectual property may be inadequate. We will not be able to protect our intellectual property if we are unable to enforce our rights or if we do not detect unauthorized use of our intellectual property. Despite our precautions, it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy our products and use information that we regard as proprietary to create products and services that compete with ours. Some license provisions protecting against unauthorized use, copying, transfer, and disclosure of our licensed products may be unenforceable under the laws of certain jurisdictions and foreign countries. Further, the laws of some countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the US. To the extent we expand our international activities, our exposure to unauthorized copying and use of our products and proprietary information may increase. We enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and consultants and enter into confidentiality agreements with the parties with whom we have strategic relationships and business alliances. These agreements may not be effective in controlling access to and distribution of our products and proprietary information. Further, these agreements do not prevent our competitors from independently developing technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our products. Litigation brought to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights could be costly, time consuming, and distracting to management, and could result in the impairment or loss of portions of our intellectual property. If we fail to secure, protect, and enforce our intellectual property rights, we may lose valuable assets, generate reduced revenue, and incur costly litigation to protect our rights, which could seriously harm our brand and adversely impact our business.
We may be sued by third parties for alleged infringement of their proprietary rights or may find it necessary to enter into licensing arrangements with third parties to settle or forestall such claims, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.
There is considerable patent and other intellectual property development activity in our industry. Our success depends in part upon our not infringing the intellectual property rights of others. However, our competitors, as well as a number of other entities and individuals, may own or claim to own intellectual property relating to our industry or, in some cases, our technology or products. From time to time, such third parties may claim that we are infringing their intellectual property rights, and we may actually be found to be infringing such rights. Moreover, we may be subject to claims of infringement with respect to technology that we acquire or license from third parties. The risk that we could be subject to infringement claims is increasing as the number of products and companies competing with our solutions grows. Any claims or litigation could require the commitment of substantial time and resources and, if successfully asserted against us, could require that we pay substantial damages or ongoing royalty or licensing payments, indemnify our customers, distributors, or other third parties, modify or discontinue the sale of our products, or refund fees, any of which would deplete our resources and adversely impact our business. We have in the past obtained, and may in the future obtain, licenses from third parties to forestall or settle potential claims that our products and technology infringe the intellectual property rights of others. Discussions and negotiations with such third parties, whether successful or unsuccessful, could result in substantial costs and the diversion of management resources, either of which could seriously harm our business.
Indemnity provisions in various agreements potentially expose us to substantial liability for intellectual property infringement and other losses.
Our agreements with customers and other third parties may include indemnification provisions under which we agree to indemnify them for losses suffered or incurred as a result of claims of intellectual property infringement, damages caused by us to property or persons, or other liabilities relating to or arising from our products, services, or other contractual obligations. The term of these indemnity provisions generally survives termination or expiration of the applicable agreement. Large indemnity payments could harm our business, operating results, and financial condition. From time to time, we are requested by customers to indemnify them for breach of confidentiality with respect to personal data. Although we normally do not agree to, or contractually limit our liability with respect to, such requests, the existence of such a dispute with a customer may have adverse effects on our customer relationships and reputation.
We use open source software in our products, which could subject us to litigation or other actions.
We use open source software in our products and services and may use more open source software in the future. From time to time, companies that use open source software have faced claims challenging the use of such open source software and their compliance with the terms of the applicable open source license. As a result, we could be subject to suits by parties claiming ownership of what we believe to be open source software, or claiming non-compliance with the applicable open source licensing terms. Litigation could be costly for us to defend, have a negative effect on our operating results and financial condition, or require us to devote additional research and development resources to change our products. In addition, some open source licenses require end-users who distribute or make available across a network products and services that include open source software to make available all or part of such software, which in some circumstances could include valuable proprietary code, at no cost, and/or license such code under the terms of the particular open source license. While we employ practices designed to monitor our compliance with the licenses of third-party open source software and protect our proprietary source code, we may inadvertently use third-party open source software in a manner that exposes us to claims of non-compliance with the applicable terms of such license, including claims for infringement of intellectual property rights or for breach of contract. Furthermore, there is an increasing number of open-source software license types, almost none of which has been tested in a court of law, resulting in a lack of guidance regarding the proper legal interpretation of such license types. If we inappropriately use open source software, we may be required to expend time and resources to re-engineer our products and services, discontinue the sale of our products, organize a legal defense against claims and allegations regarding our use of open source software, or take other remedial actions. In addition, the use of third-party open source software may expose us to greater risks than the use of third-party commercial software because open-source licensors generally do not provide warranties or controls on the functionality or origin of the software. Use of open source software may also present additional security risks because the public availability of such software may make it easier for hackers and other third-parties to determine how to compromise our platform. Any of the foregoing could be harmful to our business, financial condition, or operating results.
Risks Related to Reliance on Our Employees
If we fail to retain key employees and recruit qualified technical and sales personnel, our business could be harmed.
We believe that our success depends on the continued employment of our senior management and other key employees. From time to time, there may be changes in our management team resulting from the hiring or departure of executives. For example: during 2020 our founder, Adam Miller, transitioned from chief executive officer to co-chairman of the board; Phil Saunders, the former chief executive officer of Saba, was appointed by the board to serve as Cornerstone’s new chief executive officer; Brian Swartz resigned from his position as our chief financial officer; and in January 2021 the board appointed Chirag Shah as our new chief financial officer effective February 1, 2021. Changes such as these could disrupt our business. In addition, because our future success is dependent on our ability to continue to enhance and introduce new software and services, we are heavily dependent on our ability to attract and retain qualified engineers with the requisite education, background, and industry experience. As we expand our business, our continued success will also depend, in part, on our ability to attract and retain qualified sales, marketing, and operational personnel capable of supporting a larger and more diverse customer base. The loss of the services of a significant number of our engineers or sales people could be disruptive to our development efforts or business relationships. In addition, if any of our key employees joins a competitor or decides to otherwise compete with us, we may experience a material disruption of our operations and development plans, which may cause us to lose customers or increase operating expenses as the attention of our remaining senior managers is diverted to recruit replacements for the departed key employees.
Furthermore, foreign nationals who are not US citizens or permanent residents constitute an important part of our US workforce, particularly in the areas of engineering and product development. Our ability to hire and retain these workers and their ability to remain and work in the US are impacted by laws and regulations, as well as by procedures and enforcement practices of various government agencies. Changes to US immigration and work authorization laws and regulations, including those recently implemented in the US, can be significantly affected by political forces and levels of economic activity. These and any further legislative or administrative changes to immigration or visa laws and regulations may impair our ability to hire or retain personnel who are not US citizens or permanent residents, increase our operating expenses, or negatively impact our ability to deliver our products and services, which may materially adversely affect our business or our ability to expand our operations, including internationally.
Failure to effectively retain, and continue to increase the productivity of, our direct sales teams will impede our growth.
We will need to continue to increase the productivity of and retain our sales and marketing infrastructure in order to grow our customer base and our business. We may engage additional third-party distributors, both domestically and internationally. Identifying, recruiting, and training these people and entities will require significant time, expense, and attention. If we are unable to achieve our expected productivity increases, we may not be able to significantly increase our revenue, profitability, and/or free cash flows. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have suspended non-essential business-related travel and a significant portion of our employees are now working from home which limits the ability of our sales team to visit customers and prospects. This may affect our business, financial condition, or operating results.
Our business and operations are experiencing growth and organizational change. If we fail to effectively manage such growth and change in a manner that preserves the key aspects of our corporate culture, our business and operating results could be harmed.
Our corporate culture focuses on rapid innovation, teamwork, and attention to customer success, all of which we believe have been central to our growth so far. We have experienced, and may continue to experience, rapid growth and organizational change, including growth and organizational change resulting from our acquisition of and subsequent integration with other businesses, such as Saba, as well as organizational change due to workforce reduction plans announced in 2020, which has placed, and may continue to place, significant demands on our operational, financial, and management resources. We may continue to expand our international operations into other countries in the future, either organically or through acquisitions. We have also experienced significant growth in the number of users, transactions, and data that our SaaS hosting infrastructure supports. Finally, our organizational structure is becoming more complex as we improve our operational, financial, and management controls as well as our reporting systems and procedures. We will require significant capital expenditures and the allocation of valuable management resources to grow and change in these areas without undermining our corporate culture. If we fail to manage our anticipated growth and change in a manner that preserves the key aspects of our corporate culture, the quality of our products may suffer, which could negatively affect our brand and reputation and harm our ability to retain and attract customers.
Restructuring activities could adversely affect our ability to execute our business strategy.
We have in the past implemented headcount-related restructuring measures, and in the future it may become necessary for us to continue to restructure our business due to worldwide market conditions or other factors that reduce the demand for our products and services, which could adversely affect our ability to execute our business strategy. For example, in 2020, we announced plans to reduce headcount as part of our phased integration with Saba to streamline the organization. This workforce reduction plan and any future restructuring may have other consequences, such as attrition beyond the planned reduction in workforce, a negative effect on employee morale and productivity, or a reduction in our ability to attract and retain highly skilled employees.
Risks Related to Tax Issues
We are a multinational organization faced with increasingly complex tax issues in many jurisdictions, and we could be obligated to pay additional taxes in various jurisdictions.
As a multinational organization, we are subject to taxation in several jurisdictions around the world with increasingly complex tax laws, the application of which can be uncertain. The amount of taxes we pay in these jurisdictions could increase substantially as a result of changes in the applicable tax principles, including increased tax rates, new tax laws, or revised interpretations of existing tax laws and precedents, which could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and operating results. In addition, the authorities in these jurisdictions could review our tax returns and impose additional tax, interest, and penalties, and the authorities could claim that various withholding requirements apply to us or our subsidiaries or assert that benefits of tax treaties are not available to us or our subsidiaries, any of which could have a material impact on us and our operating results. If we are selected for future examinations that uncover incorrect tax positions, we could be subject to additional taxes, interest, and penalties.
Taxing authorities could reallocate our taxable income among our subsidiaries, which could increase our consolidated tax liability.
We conduct operations worldwide through subsidiaries in various tax jurisdictions pursuant to transfer pricing arrangements between our subsidiaries. If two or more affiliated companies are located in different countries, the tax laws or regulations of each country generally will require that transfer prices be the same as those between unrelated companies dealing at arms’ length and that contemporaneous documentation is maintained to support the transfer prices. While we believe that we operate in compliance with applicable transfer pricing laws and intend to continue to do so, our transfer pricing procedures are not binding on applicable tax authorities. If tax authorities in any of these countries were to successfully challenge our transfer prices as not reflecting arm’s length transactions, they could require us to adjust our transfer prices and thereby reallocate our income to reflect these revised transfer prices, which could result in a higher tax liability to us. In addition, if the country from which the income is reallocated does not agree with the reallocation, both countries could tax the same income, resulting in double taxation. If tax authorities were to allocate income to a higher tax jurisdiction, subject our income to double taxation or assess interest and penalties, it would increase our consolidated tax liability, which could adversely affect our financial condition, operating results, and cash flows.
Changes in tax laws or regulations that are applied adversely to us or our customers may have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flow, financial condition, or results of operations.
New income, sales, use, or other tax laws, statutes, rules, regulations, or ordinances could be enacted at any time, which could adversely affect our business operations and financial performance. Further, existing tax laws, statutes, rules, regulations, or ordinances could be interpreted, changed, modified, or applied adversely to us. For example, US federal tax legislation enacted in 2017, informally titled the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”), enacted many significant changes to the US tax laws. Future guidance from the US Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities with respect to the Tax Act may affect us, and certain aspects of the Tax Act could be repealed or modified in future legislation. For example, legislation enacted on March 27, 2020, entitled the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the “CARES Act”), modified certain provisions of the Tax Act. In addition, it is uncertain if and to what extent various states will conform to the Tax Act, the CARES Act or any newly enacted federal tax legislation. Changes in corporate tax rates, the realization of net deferred tax assets relating to our operations, the taxation of foreign earnings, and the deductibility of expenses under the Tax Act or future reform legislation could have a material impact on the value of our deferred tax assets, could result in significant one-time charges, and could increase our future US tax expense.
Our ability to use net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes to reduce future tax payments may be subject to limitations.
Our US federal net operating loss carryforwards generated in taxable years beginning before January 1, 2018, may be carried forward to offset future taxable income, if any, until such net operating loss carryforwards expire. Under the Tax Act, as modified by the CARES Act, US federal net operating losses incurred in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017 may be carried forward indefinitely, but the deductibility of such US federal net operating losses in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2020 is limited to 80% of taxable income. It is uncertain if and to what extent various states will conform to the Tax Act or the CARES Act.
In addition, under Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, if a corporation undergoes an “ownership change” (generally defined as a greater than 50 percentage point change (by value) in its equity ownership over a three-year period), the corporation’s ability to use its pre-change net operating loss carryforwards and other pre-change tax attributes (such as research tax credits) to offset its post-change income may be limited. We may experience ownership changes in the future as a result of subsequent shifts in our stock ownership. We may therefore be limited in the portion of net operating loss carryforwards and other applicable tax attributes that we can use in the future to offset taxable income for US federal income tax purposes. In addition, at the state level, there may be periods during which the use of net operating losses is suspended or otherwise limited, which could accelerate or permanently increase state taxes owed.
General Risk Factors
As a public company, we are obligated to maintain proper and effective internal control over financial reporting. If our internal control over financial reporting is ineffective, our financial reporting may not be accurate, complete, and timely and our auditors may be unable to attest to its effectiveness when required, thus adversely affecting investor confidence in our company.
We are required, pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, to furnish a report by management on, among other things, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Our auditors also need to audit the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, including disclosure of any material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting.
We have incurred and continue to incur significant costs assessing our system of internal control over financial reporting and processing documentation necessary to perform the evaluation needed to comply with Section 404. We may discover, and may not be able to remediate, future significant deficiencies or material weaknesses, or we may be unable to complete our evaluation, testing or any required remediation in a timely fashion. Further, to the extent we acquire other businesses, such as Saba, a privately held company we acquired in April 2020, during the course of integration we may find that the acquired company did not have a sufficiently robust system of internal controls and we may discover significant deficiencies or material weaknesses, any of which could require us to implement changes to our existing system of internal control over financial reporting. Failure of our internal controls over financial reporting could cause our financial reporting to be inaccurate, incomplete, or delayed. Moreover, even if there is no inaccuracy, incompletion, or delay of reporting results, if we identify one or more material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting, we will be unable to assert, and our auditors will be unable to affirm, that our internal control environment is effective, in which case investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, which could have a material adverse effect on the price of our common stock and our ability to meet the applicable covenants in our credit agreement.
Additionally, a control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system’s objectives will be met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues, if any, have been detected. Failure of our control systems to prevent error could materially adversely impact us.
The trading price of our common stock may be volatile.
The trading price of our common stock has at times been volatile and could continue to be subject to significant fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. In addition, the stock market in general, and the market for technology companies in particular, has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of the companies operating in such markets. The market price of our common stock may be similarly volatile, and investors in our common stock may experience a decrease in the value of their shares, including as a result of factors unrelated to our operating performance and prospects. The market price of our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to a number of factors, including:
•our operating performance and the performance of other similar companies;
•the financial or non-financial metric projections we provide to the public, including the failure of the projections to meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors, and any changes in these projections or our failure to meet or exceed these projections;
•the overall performance of the equity markets;
•developments with respect to intellectual property rights;
•publication of unfavorable research reports about us or our industry or withdrawal of research coverage by securities analysts;
•speculation in the press or investment community;
•the size of our public float;
•natural disasters, outbreaks of pandemic diseases (such as COVID-19), or terrorist acts;
•actual or perceived data security incidents that we or our service providers may suffer;
•announcements by us or our competitors of significant contracts, new technologies, acquisitions, commercial relationships, joint ventures, or capital commitments; and
•global economic, legal, and regulatory factors unrelated to our performance.
In the past, some companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been subject to securities class action litigation. We may be the target of this type of litigation in the future. Securities litigation against us could result in substantial costs and divert our management’s attention from other business concerns, which could harm our business.
The issuance of additional stock in connection with acquisitions, our stock incentive plans or otherwise will dilute all other stockholdings.
Our certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue up to 1,000,000,000 shares of common stock and up to 50,000,000 shares of preferred stock with such rights and preferences as may be determined by our board of directors. Subject to compliance with applicable rules and regulations, we may issue all of these shares that are not already outstanding without any action or approval by our stockholders. We intend to continue to evaluate strategic acquisitions in the future. We may pay for such acquisitions, partly or in full, through the issuance of additional equity. For example, we issued 1,110,352 shares of our common stock in connection with our April 2020 acquisition of Saba. Any future issuance of shares in connection with our acquisitions, the exercise of stock options, the vesting of restricted stock units (“RSUs”) or otherwise would dilute the percentage ownership held by existing investors.
Conversion of our Convertible Notes may dilute the ownership interest of existing stockholders, including holders who had previously converted their Convertible Notes, or may otherwise depress the price of our common stock.
The conversion of some or all of our Convertible Notes, to the extent we deliver shares upon conversion of the Convertible Notes, will dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders. The Convertible Notes and the underlying shares issuable upon conversion of such notes may be sold in the public market upon issuance. Any sales of the Convertible Notes or our common stock issuable upon conversion of the Convertible Notes could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock. In addition, the existence of the Convertible Notes may encourage short selling by market participants because the conversion of the Convertible Notes could be used to satisfy short positions, or anticipated conversion of the Convertible Notes into shares of our common stock could depress the price of our common stock.
Anti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and Delaware law may delay or prevent an acquisition of our company.
Our certificate of incorporation, our bylaws, and Delaware law contain provisions that may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of us or changes in our management. Our certificate of incorporation and our bylaws include provisions that:
•authorize “blank check” preferred stock, which could be issued by the board of directors without stockholder approval and may contain voting, liquidation, dividend, and other rights superior to our common stock;
•create a classified board of directors whose members serve staggered three-year terms, (except that we began the process of phasing out our classified board of directors in 2019 and, starting at the 2021 annual meeting of stockholders, all directors elected by stockholders will be elected to one-year terms);
•provide that our directors who have been elected to serve a three-year term (or any director appointed to fill a vacancy caused by the death, resignation, retirement, disqualification, or other removal of such director) may be removed only for cause until the expiration of such three-year term;
•eliminate the ability of stockholders to act by written consent;
•specify that special meetings of our stockholders can be called only by our board of directors, the chairperson of the board, the chief executive officer, or the president;
•establish an advance notice procedure for stockholder approvals to be brought before an annual meeting of our stockholders, including proposed nominations of persons for election to our board of directors;
•provide that vacancies on our board of directors may be filled only by the vote of a majority of directors then in office, even though less than a quorum;
•specify that no stockholder is permitted to cumulate votes at any election of directors; and
•require supermajority votes of the holders of our common stock to amend specified provisions of our charter documents.
These provisions, alone or together, could delay or prevent hostile takeovers and changes in control or changes in our management.
In addition, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which limits the ability of stockholders owning in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock to merge or combine with us.
Any provision of our certificate of incorporation, our bylaws or Delaware law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock, and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock.
The nature of our business requires the application of complex revenue and expense recognition rules. Changes in financial accounting standards or practices may cause adverse, unexpected financial reporting fluctuations and affect our reported operating results.
The accounting rules and regulations that we must comply with are complex and subject to interpretation by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”), the Securities and Exchange Commission and various bodies formed to promulgate and interpret appropriate accounting principles. In addition, many companies’ accounting disclosures are being subjected to heightened scrutiny by regulators and the public. A change in accounting standards or practices can have a significant effect on our reported results and may even affect our reporting of transactions completed before the change is effective. New accounting pronouncements and varying interpretations of accounting pronouncements have occurred and may occur in the future. Changes to existing rules or the questioning of current practices may adversely affect our reported financial results or the way we conduct our business.
We may invest in companies for strategic reasons and may not realize a return on our investments.
We sometimes invest in, advise, and collaborate with companies building innovative business applications that support the continued expansion of our market reach. We have made, and from time to time may continue to make, strategic investments in privately-held companies. The privately-held companies in which we may invest are inherently risky. The technologies and products these companies have under development are typically in the early stages and may never materialize, which could result in a loss of all or a substantial part of our initial investment in these companies. The evaluation of privately-held companies is based on information that we request from these companies, which is not subject to the same disclosure regulations as US publicly traded companies, and as such, the basis for these evaluations is subject to the timing and accuracy of the data received from these companies.
Failure to comply with anti-bribery, anti-corruption, and anti-money laundering laws could subject us to penalties and other adverse consequences.
We are subject to the FCPA, the UK Bribery Act, and other anti-corruption, anti-bribery, and anti-money laundering laws in various jurisdictions both domestic and abroad. We leverage third parties, including channel partners, to sell subscriptions to our solutions and conduct our business abroad. We and our third-party intermediaries may have direct or indirect interactions with officials and employees of government agencies or state-owned or affiliated entities and may be held liable for the corrupt or other illegal activities of these third-party business partners and intermediaries, our employees, representatives, contractors, channel partners, and agents, even if we do not explicitly authorize such activities. While we have policies and procedures to address compliance with such laws, we cannot guarantee that all of our employees and agents will not take actions in violation of our policies and applicable law, for which we may be ultimately held responsible. Any violation of the FCPA, the UK Bribery Act, or other applicable anti-bribery, anti-corruption laws, and anti-money laundering laws could result in whistleblower complaints, adverse media coverage, investigations, loss of export privileges, severe criminal or civil sanctions, or suspension or debarment from US or other government contracts, all of which may have an adverse effect on our reputation, business, operating results, and prospects.
Our investment portfolio is subject to general credit, liquidity, counterparty, market, and interest rate risks, any of which could impair the market value of our investments and harm our financial results.
At December 31, 2020, we had $153.2 million in cash and cash equivalents. Although we follow an established investment policy and set of guidelines to manage our investment portfolio, our investments are subject to general credit, liquidity, counterparty, market, and interest rate risks. We liquidated a significant portion of our investment portfolio during the first quarter of 2020 to partially fund the cash consideration we paid in connection with our April 2020 acquisition of Saba. We do not anticipate having a material investment portfolio for the foreseeable future.
Because the market value of fixed-rate debt securities may be adversely impacted by a rise in interest rates, our future investment income may fall short of expectations if interest rates rise. In addition, we may suffer losses if we are forced to sell securities that have experienced a decline in market value because of changes in interest rates. Currently, we use financial derivatives to hedge our interest rate exposure. For additional information refer to Note 4 - Debt and Note 10 - Fair Value of Financial Instruments.
The fair value of our investments may change significantly due to events and conditions in the credit and capital markets. Any investment securities that we hold, or the issuers of such securities, could be subject to review for possible downgrade. Any downgrade in these credit ratings may result in an additional decline in the estimated fair value of our investments. Changes in the various assumptions used to value these securities and any increase in the perceived market risk associated with such investments may also result in a decline in estimated fair value.
In the event of adverse conditions in the credit and capital markets, and to the extent we make future investments, our investment portfolio may be impacted, and we could determine that some or all of our investments experienced an other-than-temporary decline in fair value, requiring impairment, which could adversely impact our financial position and operating results.","Item 1B.

Our principal offices are located in Santa Monica, California, where we occupy approximately 94,000 square feet of office space under operating leases that expire in January 2024. We lease additional facilities in the US and various other countries. We may sublease certain of these facilities where space is not fully utilized. We believe that our facilities are adequate for our current needs and that suitable additional or substitute space will be available as needed to accommodate planned expansion of our operations. Refer to Note 8 - Restructuring and Note 15 - Leases in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information about our lease commitments.","Item 3. Legal Proceedings
From time to time, we are involved in a variety of claims, suits, investigations, and proceedings arising from the ordinary course of our business, including actions with respect to intellectual property claims, breach of contract, and tort claims, labor and employment claims, tax, and other matters. Although claims, suits, investigations, and proceedings are inherently uncertain and their results cannot be predicted with certainty, we believe that the resolution of our current pending matters will not have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flow. Regardless of the outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on us because of defense costs, diversion of management resources, and other factors. In addition, it is possible that an unfavorable resolution of one or more such proceedings could in the future materially and adversely affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows in a particular period.","Item 4.

Together, the combined Company reaches over 6,000 customers of all sizes, spanning more than 75 million users across over 180 countries and nearly 50 languages.
We work with customers across all geographies and markets. Our customers include multi-national corporations, large domestic and foreign-based enterprises, mid-market companies, public sector organizations, healthcare providers, higher education institutions, non-profit organizations, and small businesses. We sell our solutions domestically and internationally through both direct and indirect channels, including direct sales teams throughout North and South America, Europe, and Asia-Pacific and distributor relationships with payroll companies, human resource consultancies, and global system integrators.

Our goal is to empower people, organizations, and communities to realize their potential with comprehensive people development solutions that are built to last. Our growth strategy since inception has been deliberate and focused on long-term success. This has allowed us to weather periods of economic turmoil and significant changes in the markets we serve without experiencing business contraction.
COVID-19
The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the global economy and on our business continues to be fluid. We responded quickly across our organization to guard the health and safety of our team, support our partners and vendors, and mitigate risk. After careful review of our operations, while the ongoing and developing circumstances related to the COVID-19 pandemic remain highly uncertain, we believe that we are well positioned to address challenges related to the COVID-19 pandemic and to continue to execute against our strategic priorities and financial goals. We have several members of our team working cross-functionally to collect, monitor, and analyze evolving information regarding the COVID-19 pandemic and to make recommendations to our executive leadership team and board of directors regarding risk identification and mitigation planning. We have also taken steps to protect the health and welfare of our employees by temporarily closing our offices and suspending non-essential business-related travel, while continuing our commitment and efforts to serve customers that rely on us. Thus far, we believe our employees have rapidly adapted to working remotely, and we are closely monitoring the COVID-19 pandemic to ensure we have plans in place for mitigating disruptions in our operations, including maintaining high levels of uptime, and service and support to our customers. We continue to proactively assess, monitor, and respond to domestic and international developments related to the COVID-19 pandemic, and we will implement risk-mitigation plans as needed to minimize the impact on our partner relationships and business operations. While our customer base spans a variety of industries and geographies, our customers have been and may continue to be negatively impacted by COVID-19. This has resulted in (and may continue to result in) delayed purchasing decisions from prospective customers, reduced customer demand, reduced customer spend (which had an impact on our net annual dollar retention rate in 2020), and delayed payments, all of which could affect our future revenues and cash flows. Because our near-term revenues are relatively predictable as a result of our subscription-based business model, the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic may not be fully reflected in our operating results and financial condition until future periods. See “Risks Related to COVID-19” in Item 1A Risk Factors of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a description of risks to us due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Other Key Metrics
We regularly review a number of metrics, including the following key metrics, to evaluate our business, measure our performance, identify trends affecting our business, formulate financial projections, and make strategic decisions.
•Revenue. Revenue consists primarily of subscription revenue and professional service revenue. We generally recognize revenue over the delivery period. Because of the seasonality of our business and the timing of when we enter into new customer agreements, revenue from customer agreements signed in the current period may not be fully reflected in the current period.
•Subscription Revenue. Subscription revenue represents subscriptions to our people development solutions, content subscriptions, and related support sold on a recurring basis.
•Annual Recurring Revenue. In order to assess our business performance with a metric that reflects our focus on a subscription-based (or recurring revenue) business model, we track annual recurring revenue, which we define as the annualized recurring value of all active contracts at the end of a reporting period. We believe this metric is useful to investors in evaluating our ongoing operational performance and trends, and in comparing our financial measures with other companies in the same industry. However, it is important to note that other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate annual recurring revenue differently or not at all, which may reduce its usefulness as a comparative measure.
•Free Cash Flow. We define free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, as cash provided by operating activities minus capital expenditures and capitalized software costs. We present this metric because it is a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by our business that can be used for strategic opportunities, including investing in our business and strengthening our balance sheet.
•Net Annual Dollar Retention Rate. We define net annual dollar retention rate as the percentage of annual recurring revenue from all customers on the first day of a fiscal year that is retained from those same customers on the last day of that same fiscal year. This percentage excludes all annual recurring revenue from new customers added during the fiscal year. Incremental sales during the fiscal year to customers are included in the calculation solely for customers that existed as of the first day of the fiscal year. Therefore, it is possible for our net annual dollar retention rate to exceed 100% in a given year if incremental sales to existing customers exceed the churn in annual recurring revenue from those same customers during the fiscal year.
Prior to 2020, incremental sales were only included to the extent those sales offset any decrease in annual recurring revenue from the original amount on the first day of the fiscal year and therefore, the historical net annual dollar retention rate could never exceed 100%. This ratio for 2020 includes all customers. Previously, Cornerstone for Salesforce, Cornerstone PiiQ, Grovo, and Workpop customers were excluded from the calculation. We believe that our net annual dollar retention rate is an important metric to measure the long-term value of customer agreements and our ability to retain and incrementally sell to our customers.
•Constant currency results. We have historically presented constant currency information, a non-GAAP financial measure, to provide a framework for assessing how our underlying business performed excluding the effect of foreign currency fluctuations. However, due to the acquisition of Saba in the second quarter of 2020, constant currency results on a combined company basis were not presented for the second and third quarters in 2020, as well as in this Form 10-K, as the historical comparative periods did not include the combined company results for a full quarter.
•Number of customers. We believe that our ability to expand our customer base is an indicator of our market penetration and the growth of our business as we continue to invest in our direct sales teams and distributors. Our customer count includes contracted customers for our enterprise people development solutions as of the end of the period. During the second quarter of 2020, we adjusted our method of determining customer count to exclude customers that are sold through resellers that share one tenant or instance of our product. We continue to exclude customers from our Cornerstone for Salesforce, PiiQ, Grovo, Workpop, and Clustree products from our customer count metrics.
Key Components of Our Results of Operations
Sources of Revenue and Revenue Recognition
Our solutions are designed to enable organizations to meet the challenges they face in maximizing the productivity of their human capital. We generate revenue from the following sources:
•Subscriptions to Our Products and Other Offerings on a Recurring Basis. Customers pay subscription fees for access to our enterprise people development solutions, other products, and support on a recurring basis. Fees are based on a number of factors, including the number of products purchased and the number of users having access to a product. We generally recognize revenue from subscriptions ratably over the term of the agreements beginning on the date the subscription service is made available to the customer. Subscription agreements are typically three years, billed annually in advance, and non-cancelable, with payment due within 30 days of the invoice date.
•Professional Services and Other. We offer our customers and implementation partners assistance in implementing our products and optimizing their use. Services are generally billed either upfront on a fixed rate basis, on a time and materials basis, or are included as part of the subscription fee. We generally recognize revenue from fixed fee professional services contracts as services are performed based on the proportion performed to date relative to the total expected services to be performed. Revenue associated with time-and-material contracts are recorded as such time and materials are incurred.
Our customer agreements generally include both subscriptions to access our products and related professional services. Our agreements generally do not contain any cancellation or refund provisions other than in the event of our default.
Cost of Revenue
Cost of revenue consists primarily of costs related to hosting our products and delivery of professional services, and includes the following:
•personnel and related expenses, including stock-based compensation;
•expenses for network-related infrastructure and IT support;
•delivery of contracted professional services and ongoing customer support;
•payments to external service providers contracted to perform implementation services;
•depreciation of data centers and amortization of: capitalized software costs, developed technology software license rights, and technology-related intangible assets from acquisitions; and
•content and licensing fees and referral fees.
In addition, we allocate a portion of overhead, such as rent, IT costs, depreciation and amortization, and employee benefits costs, to cost of revenue based on headcount. The costs associated with providing professional services are significantly higher, as a percentage of revenue, than the costs associated with providing access to our products due to the labor costs to provide the consulting services.
Operating Expenses
Our operating expenses are as follows:
•Sales and Marketing. Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of: personnel and related expenses for our sales and marketing staff, including salaries, benefits, bonuses, stock-based compensation, and commissions; costs of marketing and promotional events, corporate communications, online marketing, product marketing, and other brand-building activities; amortization of customer-related intangible assets from acquisitions; and allocated overhead.
•Research and Development. Research and development expenses consist primarily of: personnel and related expenses for our research and development staff, including salaries, benefits, bonuses, and stock-based compensation; the cost of certain third-party service providers; and allocated overhead. Research and development costs, other than software development costs qualifying for capitalization, are expensed as incurred.
•General and Administrative. General and administrative expenses consist primarily of: personnel and related expenses for administrative, legal, finance, and human resource staff, including salaries, benefits, bonuses, and stock-based compensation; professional fees; insurance premiums; amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets; other corporate expenses; and allocated overhead.
•Acquisition-Related and Integration. Acquisition-related and integration expenses consist primarily of external professional services directly associated with acquisitions, such as advisory fees, accounting and legal costs, filing fees, due diligence, and integration costs.
•Restructuring. Restructuring expenses consist primarily of payroll-related and stock-based compensation costs associated with employee terminations, as well as costs associated with vacated facilities. For additional information refer to Note 8 - Restructuring of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Other Income (Expense)
•Interest Expense. Interest expense consists primarily of interest expense from our debt obligations, including our Term Loan Facility, Revolving Credit Facility, and Convertible Notes (each defined below). Interest expense is primarily composed of contractual interest, commitment fees on unused amounts available on the Revolving Credit Facility, accretion of debt discount, and amortization of debt issuance costs.
•Other, Net. Other, net consists of interest income, income and expense associated with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, fair value adjustments to strategic investments, and other non-operating expenses. Interest income consists primarily of interest income from investment securities. We expect interest income to vary depending on the level of our investments in marketable securities, which may include corporate bonds, agency bonds, US treasury securities, and commercial paper. We expect other, net to vary depending on the movement in foreign currency exchange rates and the related impact on our foreign exchange gain (loss).
Income Tax Provision
On a consolidated basis, we have incurred operating losses and have recorded a valuation allowance against our US, UK, and other deferred tax assets for all periods to date and, accordingly, have not generally recorded a benefit for income taxes for any of the periods presented. However, during the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, we recorded an income tax benefit attributable to deferred tax assets in the US. Approximately $26.7 million of this benefit was realized in connection with the recording of deferred tax liabilities from the acquisition of Saba, which was attributable to the reversal of a portion of our US federal and state valuation allowance on deferred tax assets that are more likely than not to be realized. The remaining portion of this benefit is related to the release of valuation allowances on certain deferred tax assets due to a change in assessment of future taxable income in certain jurisdictions. Certain foreign subsidiaries and branches provide intercompany services and are compensated as limited risk distributors and/or on a cost-plus basis, and therefore, have incurred liabilities for foreign income taxes in their respective jurisdictions. We have recorded a provision for certain foreign and state income taxes.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Other Key Metrics
The following table sets forth our key metrics that we use to evaluate our business, measure our performance, identify trends affecting our business, formulate financial projections, and make strategic decisions:
Year Ended December 31,
2020 2019 2018
(dollars in thousands)
Revenue $ 740,916 $ 576,523 $ 537,891
Subscription revenue $ 705,159 $ 542,968 $ 473,052
Annual recurring revenue $ 840,000 $ 575,000 $ 510,000
Free cash flow $ 64,074 $ 72,847 $ 49,843
Net annual dollar retention rate 95.1 % 104.6 % 105.7 %
Number of customers 6,157 3,508 3,333
Total revenue growth increased to 28.5% in 2020 from 7.2% in 2019. Without giving effect to the acquisition of Saba, revenue would have increased 6.5% for the same period. Our growth rate can depend on a variety of factors, such as new customers, the size, volume, and complexity of our agreements with our customers, foreign currency movements, our ability to work with our customers to implement and deliver our products, our ability to upsell and renew our existing customers, the success of our alliance and partnership arrangements, and the expansion of our business through emerging markets. The increase in the growth rate of total revenue was primarily driven by our acquisition of Saba during 2020.
The following table sets forth our sources of revenue for each of the periods indicated:
Year Ended December 31,
2020 2019 2018
(dollars in thousands)
Subscription revenue $ 705,159 $ 542,968 $ 473,052
Percentage of subscription revenue to total revenue 95.2 % 94.2 % 87.9 %
Professional services revenue $ 35,757 $ 33,555 $ 64,839
Percentage of professional services to total revenue 4.8 % 5.8 % 12.1 %
Total revenue $ 740,916 $ 576,523 $ 537,891
Subscription revenue increased by $162.2 million, or 29.9%, in 2020 when compared to 2019. Without giving effect to the acquisition of Saba, subscription revenue would have increased 9.4% for the same period. Professional services revenue increased by $2.2 million, or 6.6%, in 2020 when compared to 2019. The increase of both subscription and professional services revenue was primarily attributable to the acquisition of Saba during 2020. Professional services revenue as a percentage of total revenue continued to decline from 2019 to 2020 due to the execution of our strategic initiative to migrate much of our implementation services to our global partners.
Subscription revenue increased by $69.9 million, or 14.8%, in 2019 when compared to 2018. The increase was attributable to new business, which included new customers, upsells, and renewals from existing customers. Professional services revenue decreased by $31.3 million, or 48.2%, in 2019 when compared to 2018. The decrease of professional services revenue is attributable to the execution of our strategic initiative to migrate much of our implementation services to our global partners.
Revenue by geography is generally based on the address of the customer as defined in our master subscription agreement with each customer. The following table sets forth our revenue by geographic area for each of the periods indicated:
Year Ended December 31,

Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities and Free Cash Flow
The following table presents a reconciliation of net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow:
Year Ended December 31,
2020 2019 2018
(dollars in thousands)
Net cash provided by operating activities $ 96,934 $ 115,549 $ 90,253
Capital expenditures (5,785) (18,034) (14,895)
Capitalized software costs (27,075) (24,668) (25,515)
Free cash flow $ 64,074 $ 72,847 $ 49,843
Free cash flow margin 8.6 % 12.6 % 9.3 %
Net cash provided by operating activities for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 was $96.9 million as compared to $115.5 million during 2019. The decrease was primarily due to a larger net loss in 2020 as well as timing of customer collections.
Free cash flow for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 was $64.1 million, resulting in a free cash flow margin of 8.6%, as compared to free cash flow of $72.8 million and a free cash flow margin of 12.6 % in 2019. The decrease was primarily due to the changes in net cash provided by operating activities as described above, as well as reduced capital expenditures in 2020 as compared to 2019.
Cost of Revenue, Gross Profit, and Gross Margin
Year Ended December 31,
2020 2019 2018
(dollars in thousands)
Cost of revenue $ 227,014 $ 149,215 $ 144,349
Gross profit $ 513,902 $ 427,308 $ 393,542
Gross margin 69.4 % 74.1 % 73.2 %
Cost of revenue increased $77.8 million, or 52.1%, in 2020 as compared to 2019. The increase in cost of revenue was primarily due to acquisitions during 2020 (including amortization of acquired developed technology intangible assets of $23.7 million), as well as $9.8 million due to the reallocation of certain internal resources to customer delivery initiatives and increased data center costs, $8.9 million in increased personnel expenses, $4.7 million in increased content costs, and $3.0 million in increased capitalized software amortization. These costs were incurred to service our existing customers and support our continued growth. These increased costs were partially offset by $13.4 million in decreased external implementation professional service costs. The decline in gross margin was primarily due to amortization of acquired developed technology intangible assets from acquisitions during 2020, the reallocation of certain internal resources to customer delivery initiatives, and increased data center costs as previously discussed.
Cost of revenue increased $4.9 million, or 3.4%, in 2019 as compared to 2018. The increase in cost of revenue was primarily due to $12.1 million in increased personnel expenses, stock-based compensation, and overhead costs, $3.9 million in increased content costs, $3.6 million in increased amortization of acquired intangible assets, and $1.6 million in increased capitalized software amortization. These increased costs were partially offset by $16.4 million in decreased external implementation professional service costs. These costs were incurred to service our existing customers and support our continued growth. The improvement in gross margin was primarily due to a higher mix of subscription revenue, which carries a higher gross margin.
Sales and Marketing
Year Ended December 31,
2020 2019 2018
(dollars in thousands)
Sales and marketing $ 265,516 $ 227,733 $ 224,635
Percent of revenue 35.8 % 39.5 % 41.8 %
Sales and marketing expenses increased $37.8 million, or 16.6%, in 2020 as compared to 2019. As a percentage of revenue, sales and marketing expense decreased by approximately four percentage points. The increase in sales and marketing expenses was primarily due to the acquisition of Saba during 2020, which was partially offset by decreased employee-related expenses as well as decreased marketing expenses from hosting Convergence, our annual customer event, virtually and decreased travel in response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.
During 2018, we completed certain aspects of our strategic transformation plan to position us for long-term growth, resulting in the reallocation of certain resources (“the 2018 Reallocation”). This resulted in the change in responsibilities of certain employees from sales and marketing to research and development to better align the organization with their job functions. We intend to continue to invest in sales and marketing strategically to expand our business both domestically and internationally.
Sales and marketing expenses increased $3.1 million, or 1.4%, in 2019 as compared to 2018. As a percentage of revenue, sales and marketing expense decreased by approximately two percentage points, resulting from the 2018 Reallocation, increased cost efficiency, and leverage realized from changes to our sales commission plans as we continued our efforts to strategically scale our sales teams and improve their productivity.
Research and Development
Year Ended December 31,
2020 2019 2018
(dollars in thousands)
Research and development $ 112,945 $ 101,151 $ 76,981
Percent of revenue 15.2 % 17.5 % 14.3 %
Research and development expenses increased $11.8 million, or 11.7%, in 2020 as compared to 2019. The increase was primarily due to the acquisition of Saba during 2020, which was partially offset by reallocation of certain internal resources from research and development to customer delivery initiatives.
Research and development expenses increased $24.2 million, or 31.4%, in 2019 as compared to 2018. The increase was principally due to the 2018 Reallocation, as well as investments to maintain and improve the functionality of our products. As a result, we incurred increased employee-related costs of $16.3 million and increased overhead costs of $3.4 million.
We capitalize a portion of our software development costs related to the development and enhancements of our products, which are then amortized to cost of revenue. The timing of our capitalizable development and enhancement projects may affect the amount of development costs expensed in any given period. We capitalized $29.4 million, $29.6 million, and $31.6 million of software development costs and amortized $28.6 million, $25.3 million, and $23.5 million in 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively.

Acquisition-related and integration $ 37,289 $ - $ -
Percent of revenue 5.0 % - % - %
During the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 we incurred $37.3 million of expenses related to the acquisitions of Saba and Clustree. Acquisition-related and integration expenses consist primarily of external professional services directly associated with acquisitions, such as advisory fees, accounting and legal costs, filing fees, due diligence, and integration costs.We expect to incur additional costs related to the integration of Saba during 2021.
Restructuring
Year Ended December 31,
2020 2019 2018
(dollars in thousands)
Restructuring $ 19,066 $ - $ 8,946
Percent of revenue 2.6 % - % 1.7 %
During the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, we incurred $19.1 million of restructuring expenses, primarily due to workforce reductions announced as part of our integration plan associated with the acquisition of Saba. We will continue to evaluate other areas of synergy as part of our integration planning efforts in 2021. During 2020, we commenced the process to exit certain redundant facilities and expect facility exit activity to continue in 2021. For additional information refer to Note 8 - Restructuring of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. There were no charges incurred in 2019. Restructuring charges in 2018 consisted primarily of stock-based compensation expense of $6.1 million and payroll related costs of $2.8 million.

Other expense, net $ (55,193) $ (13,297) $ (23,478)
Interest expense in 2020 increased by $41.5 million primarily due to additional interest costs as well as amortization and accretion resulting from the Term Loan Facility and Convertible Notes. Refer to the section titled “Liquidity and Capital Resources” for additional information regarding interest expense associated with our Term Loan Facility and Convertible Notes.
Other, net primarily included foreign exchange gains and losses related to transactions denominated in foreign currencies, as well as foreign exchange gains and losses related to our intercompany loans, certain cash accounts, and interest income in 2020. Foreign exchange gains and losses for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, were primarily driven by fluctuations in the euro and US dollar in relation to the British pound. In 2019, Other, net was primarily composed of interest income earned on investment securities and money market portfolios.
Income Tax Benefit (Provision)
Year Ended December 31,
2020 2019 2018
(in thousands)
Income tax benefit (provision) $ 46,762 $ (2,690) $ (2,595)
For each of the years presented, we have recorded a full valuation allowance against our US, UK, and other deferred tax assets. We will continue to evaluate the need for a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets in the future. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, a tax provision benefit was realized from the reversal of valuation allowance on deferred tax assets. Such benefit also included amounts realized in connection with the recording of deferred tax liabilities from the acquisition of Saba, which was attributable to the reversal of $26.7 million of a portion of our US federal and state valuation allowance on deferred tax assets.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
At December 31, 2020, our principal sources of liquidity were $153.2 million of cash and cash equivalents and $221.5 million of accounts receivable. On April 22, 2020, we acquired Saba for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $1.310 billion, consisting of $1.277 billion in cash and 1,110,352 shares of common stock of the Company. In connection with the acquisition, we incurred $1.0047 billion of additional indebtedness as a senior term loan (the “Term Loan Facility”) for a purchase price equal to 97.5% of the principal amount. Principal payments are due quarterly, beginning in the fourth quarter of 2020, at a rate of 0.25% of the principal amount; the remaining outstanding principal balance is due in April 2027. Interest is payable on a monthly or quarterly basis at the Company's option. We also entered into a revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Credit Facility”) to borrow up to an additional $150.0 million, of which $102.5 million remained available at December 31, 2020. The available borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility are limited by indebtedness covenants with the holders of the Convertible Notes (defined below). The Revolving Credit Facility includes a letter of credit sub-facility of up to $30.0 million. For additional information regarding our acquisition of Saba, including the consideration payable and debt arrangements, refer to Note 3 - Business Combinations and Note 4 - Debt of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Additionally, in 2017, we issued $300.0 million principal amount of 5.75% senior convertible notes (the “Convertible Notes”) for a purchase price equal to 98% of the principal amount, to certain entities affiliated with Silver Lake (a principal owner of the Company) and LinkedIn. Holders of the Convertible Notes may convert their notes at any time prior to the close of business on the scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date. On April 20, 2020, we amended the indenture to the Convertible Notes with US Bank National Association, as trustee (the “Supplemental Indenture”). Upon the completion of the acquisition of Saba on April 22, 2020, the Supplemental Indenture became effective, which permitted us to incur additional indebtedness and extended the maturity date of the Convertible Notes from July 1, 2021 to March 17, 2023. In connection with this amendment, we paid approximately $3.4 million in consent and other fees to the holders of the Convertible Notes.
In September 2018, we used approximately $18.2 million of cash in connection with our acquisition of Workpop and in November 2018, we used approximately $22.9 million of cash in connection with our acquisition of Grovo. During the fourth quarter of 2019, we invested $8.0 million in Talespin, a developer of enterprise virtual reality training software. In January 2020, we acquired Clustree SAS (“Clustree”), a developer of a skills engine and skills ontology, for approximately $18.6 million in cash.
Our principal commitments consist of obligations for contractual debt payments, leases for our office space, software and cloud services, and other contractual obligations. In March 2020, we entered into an agreement with a provider of cloud computing services to provide services over approximately seven years. Refer to Note 14 - Commitments and Contingencies for additional information regarding this agreement. As part of the acquisition of Saba in April 2020, we assumed $48.2 million of contractual commitments-the majority of which related to lease agreements and software and cloud services. $43.7 million of these commitments relate to the five-year period following the acquisition, with the remainder relating to the period thereafter.
Based on our current level of operations and anticipated growth, we believe our future cash flows from operating activities, access to the Revolving Credit Facility, and existing cash and cash equivalents will provide adequate funds for our ongoing operations, debt service requirements, and general corporate purposes for at least the next twelve months. However, if the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic worsens or is prolonged, our customers may increasingly delay payments or request price concessions, which could adversely impact our operating cash flows. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including our ability to achieve cost synergies from integrating Saba, our rate of revenue growth and collections, the level of our sales and marketing efforts, the timing and extent of spending to support product development efforts and expansion into new territories, the timing of introductions of new services and enhancements to existing services, the timing of general and administrative expenses as we grow our administrative infrastructure, and the continuing market acceptance of our products. To the extent that existing cash, cash from operations, and access to our Revolving Credit Facility are not sufficient to fund our future activities, we may need to raise additional funds. In addition, we may enter into agreements or letters of intent with respect to potential investments in, or acquisitions of, complementary businesses, services or technologies in the future, which could also require us to seek additional financing or utilize our cash resources.
The following table sets forth a summary of our cash flows for the periods indicated (in thousands):
Year Ended December 31,
2020 2019 2018
Net cash provided by operating activities $ 96,934 $ 115,549 $ 90,253
Net cash used in investing activities (1,078,001) (97,727) (20,876)
Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities 917,186 14,775 (278,016)
Our cash flows from operating activities are significantly influenced by our growth, ability to maintain our contractual billing and collection terms, and our investments in headcount and infrastructure to support anticipated growth. Given the seasonality and continued growth of our business, our cash flows from operations will vary from period to period.
Cash provided by operating activities was $96.9 million in 2020, compared to $115.5 million in 2019. The decrease was primarily due to a larger net loss in 2020 as well as timing of customer collections.
Our primary investing activities have consisted of acquisitions, capital expenditures to develop our capitalized software as well as to purchase software, computer equipment, leasehold improvements, furniture and fixtures in support of expanding our infrastructure and workforce, and investments in marketable securities. Cash used in investing activities was $1,078.0 million in 2020, compared to $97.7 million in 2019. The net increase in cash used in investing activities was primarily due to cash consideration paid for the acquisition of Saba in 2020.
Cash provided by financing activities was $917.2 million in 2020, compared to $14.8 million in 2019. The increase in cash provided by financing activities was primarily due to proceeds from the debt we incurred in connection with the acquisition of Saba, which was partially offset by payments of debt issuance and other related costs.
Share Repurchase Programs
In November 2017, the board of directors authorized a $100.0 million share repurchase program, which was completed as of December 31, 2019 (the “2017 Share Repurchase Program”). In August 2019, the board of directors authorized a $150.0 million share repurchase program (the “2019 Share Repurchase Program”), under which we had repurchased 416,761 shares of common stock at an average price per share of $53.64 as of December 31, 2019 and did not repurchase any of our shares in 2020. For additional information on the 2019 Share Repurchase Program, refer to Note 11 - Stockholders’ Equity of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
As part of our ongoing business, we do not have any relationships with other entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, that have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. We are therefore not exposed to any financing, liquidity, market, or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in those types of relationships.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the US. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs and expenses, provision for income taxes, and related disclosures. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Changes in accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period. Accordingly, actual results could differ significantly from the estimates made by our management. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. To the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results, our future financial statement presentation, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows will be affected.
We believe that the following critical accounting policies involve a greater degree of judgment or complexity than our other accounting policies. Accordingly, these are the policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition and results of operations.
Revenue Recognition
We recognize revenue from contracts with customers based on the five steps below. The application of these steps may require the use of certain significant estimates and judgments, particularly in identifying and evaluating complex or unusual contract terms and conditions that may impact revenue recognition.
1)Identification of the contract, or contracts, with a customer
2)Identification of all performance obligations in the contract
3)Determination of the transaction price
4)Allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract
5)Recognition of revenue as we satisfy a performance obligation
We identify enforceable contracts with a customer when the agreement is signed. Contracts may contain multiple performance obligations. For these contracts, we account for individual performance obligations separately if they are distinct. The transaction price is allocated to the separate performance obligations on a relative standalone selling price (“SSP”) basis. We determine the SSP based on our overall pricing objectives, taking into consideration market conditions and other factors, including the value of our contracts, the products sold, customer demographics, geographic locations, and the number and types of users within our contracts.
Business Combinations
The results of businesses acquired in a business combination are included in our consolidated financial statements from the date of the acquisition. Assets and liabilities of an acquired business are recorded at their estimated fair values on the acquisition date. Any excess consideration over the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recognized as goodwill.
The purchase price allocation process requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions. Although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made are reasonable, they are inherently uncertain and based in part on experience, market conditions, projections of future performance, and information obtained from legacy management of acquired companies. Critical estimates include but are not limited to:
•future subscription revenue (including customer retention rates); and, operating profit margins associated with such subscription revenues;
•costs anticipated to fulfill remaining acquired performance obligations and estimated profit margin for such obligations;
•technology migration curves and royalty rates;
•discount rates;
•useful lives assigned to acquired intangibles assets; and
•uncertain tax positions and tax-related valuation allowances assumed.
The identifiable intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over their respective estimated useful lives to sales and marketing for customer-related intangible assets, cost of revenue for developed technology intangible assets, and general and administrative expense for all other intangible assets.
Stock-based Compensation
We measure and recognize compensation expense for stock-based awards granted to employees and directors using a fair value method, including RSUs and performance-based restricted stock units (“PRSUs”). For RSUs, and PRSUs with service and performance conditions, fair value is based on the closing price of our common stock on the date of grant. For PRSUs with service and market conditions, fair value is estimated using a Monte-Carlo simulation. We recognize compensation expense for PRSUs only if it is probable the performance or market conditions will be met, which is dependent upon our expectations of whether future specified financial targets will be achieved. The likelihood of achievement of these targets is assessed at each balance sheet date. We may prospectively adjust previously recognized compensation expense if current expectations differ from assessments made in previous periods. Compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures, is recognized over the requisite service period (which is generally the vesting period) on a straight-line basis for awards with only service conditions and using the accelerated attribution method for awards with both performance or market and service conditions. We estimate forfeitures based on our historical experience and regularly review the estimated forfeiture rate and make changes as factors affecting the forfeiture rate calculations and assumptions change.
Income Taxes
We use the liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under the liability method, deferred taxes are determined based on the temporary differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities, using tax rates expected to be in effect during the years in which the basis differences are expected to reverse. We record a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some of our net deferred tax assets will not be realized. In determining the need for a valuation allowance, we consider our projected future taxable income and future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences. We have recorded a valuation allowance to reduce our US, UK, and other net deferred tax assets to zero, because we have determined that it is not more likely than not that any of our US, UK, and other net deferred tax assets will be realized based on a history of losses in these jurisdictions. If in the future we determine that we will be able to realize any of our US, UK, and other net deferred tax assets, we will make an adjustment to the allowance, which would increase our income in the period that the determination is made.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
For additional information regarding recent accounting pronouncements adopted and under evaluation, refer to Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.","Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
We have operations in the US and internationally, and we are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business. These risks primarily include interest rate, foreign exchange, inflation, and counterparty risks, as well as risks relating to changes in the general economic conditions in the countries where we conduct business. To reduce certain of these risks, we monitor the financial condition of our large customers and limit credit exposure by principally collecting in advance and setting credit limits as we deem appropriate. In addition, our investment strategy has been to invest in financial instruments, including corporate bonds, US treasury securities, agency securities, commercial paper, and money market funds backed by United States Treasury Bills within the guidelines established under our investment policy. We also make strategic investments in privately-held companies in the development stage. While we may use derivative instruments to mitigate the impact of our market risk exposures, we have not used, nor do we intend to use, derivatives for trading or speculative purposes.
Interest Rate Risk
At December 31, 2020, we had cash and cash equivalents of $153.2 million. Our Term Loan Facility bears interest at a variable rate. As a result, we are exposed to market risk associated with the variable interest rate payments on these borrowings. A hypothetical immediate increase of 100 basis points in interest rates would result in an increase of approximately $2.4 million in quarterly interest payments. We use interest rate swap contracts to manage our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates related to our Term Loan Facility. We had two interest rate swap contracts outstanding at December 31, 2020. These instruments effectively cap a portion of our interest rate exposure by converting $667.8 million of our variable rate debt to a fixed interest rate. A hypothetical immediate increase of 100 basis points in interest rates would result in an increase of approximately $14.3 million in the fair value of our interest rate swap contracts. For additional information regarding our interest rate swap contracts, refer to Note 10 - Fair Value of Financial Instruments of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
The primary objectives of our marketable investment activities are the preservation of capital, the fulfillment of liquidity needs, and the fiduciary control of cash and investments. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes. We liquidated a significant portion of our investment portfolio during the first quarter of 2020 to partially fund the acquisition of Saba; we liquidated the remainder of our investment portfolio during the second quarter of 2020. We, therefore, do not expect our operating results or cash flows to be materially affected by a sudden change in market interest rates on interest-bearing investments.
We do not believe our cash equivalents have significant risk of default or illiquidity. While we believe these cash investments do not contain excessive risk, we cannot guarantee that in the future our investments will not be subject to adverse changes in market value. In addition, we maintain significant amounts of cash and cash equivalents at one or more financial institutions that are in excess of federally insured limits. We cannot guarantee that we will not experience losses on these deposits.
Foreign Currency Risk
We have foreign currency risks related to our revenue and operating expenses denominated in currencies other than the US dollar, primarily euros and British pounds. Increases and decreases in our foreign-denominated revenue from movements in foreign exchange rates are often partially offset by the corresponding decreases or increases in our foreign-denominated operating expenses. Due to our legal structure, revenue and operating expenses denominated in currencies other than the US dollar primarily flow through subsidiaries with functional currencies of the British pound and euro. Our other income (expense) is also impacted by the remeasurement of US dollar denominated intercompany loans, cash accounts held by our overseas subsidiaries, accounts receivable denominated in foreign currencies, and accounts payable denominated in foreign currencies.
As our international operations grow, our risks associated with fluctuation in currency rates will become greater, and we will continue to reassess our approach to managing this risk. In addition, currency fluctuations can increase the costs of our international expansion. The effect of a hypothetical immediate 10% adverse change in foreign exchange rates on foreign-denominated accounts at December 31, 2020, including our intercompany loans with our subsidiaries, would result in a foreign currency loss of approximately $4.7 million.
Due to our exposure to market risks that may result from changes in foreign currency exchange rates, we may enter into foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate these risks. We have not used, nor do we intend to use, these contracts for trading or speculative purposes. Forward contracts are not designated as accounting hedges; therefore, the unrealized gains and losses are recorded in other, net in the consolidated statement of operations. The fair value of these contracts is recorded in other current assets for contracts in an unrealized gain position and accrued expenses for contracts in an unrealized loss position. Our foreign currency forward exchange contracts are generally short-term in duration and consist of contracts to exchange US dollars for Canadian dollars, which are used to manage our exposure to foreign exchange rate risk related to operating expenses incurred in Canadian dollars. There were no forward contracts outstanding at December 31, 2020.
Inflation Risk
We do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Nonetheless, if our costs were to become subject to significant inflationary pressures, we may not be able to fully offset such higher costs through price increases. Our inability or failure to do so could harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
Counterparty Risk
Our consolidated financial statements are subject to counterparty credit risk, which we consider as part of the overall fair value measurement. We attempt to mitigate this risk through credit monitoring procedures.","Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Cornerstone OnDemand, Inc.
Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Cornerstone OnDemand, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the related consolidated statements of operations, of comprehensive loss, of changes in stockholders’ equity and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.
Changes in Accounting Principles
As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts for leases in 2019 and the manner in which it accounts for revenues from contracts with customers and sales commissions in 2018.
Basis for Opinions
The Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
As described in Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, management has excluded Saba Software, Inc. (“Saba”) from its assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020 because it was acquired by the Company in a purchase business combination during 2020. We have also excluded Saba from our audit of internal control over financial reporting. Saba is a wholly-owned subsidiary whose total assets and total revenues excluded from management’s assessment and our audit of internal control over financial reporting represent approximately 7.0% and 17.1%, respectively, of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Critical Audit Matters
The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.
Revenue - Identifying and Evaluating Complex or Unusual Contract Terms and Conditions that May Impact Revenue Recognition
As described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s revenue recognition is determined through the following steps: 1) identification of the contract, or contracts, with a customer; 2) identification of all performance obligations in the contract; 3) determination of the transaction price; 4) allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and 5) recognition of revenue as the Company satisfies a performance obligation. The application of these steps may require the use of certain significant estimates and judgments by management, particularly in identifying and evaluating complex or unusual contract terms and conditions that may impact revenue recognition. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company’s total revenue was $741 million.
The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to revenue - identifying and evaluating complex or unusual contract terms and conditions that may impact revenue recognition is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management in identifying and evaluating complex or unusual contract terms and conditions that may impact revenue recognition; and (ii) the high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence obtained related to whether such complex or unusual contract terms and conditions were appropriately identified and evaluated by management.
Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the revenue recognition process, including controls related to the identification and evaluation of complex or unusual contract terms and conditions that may impact revenue recognition. These procedures also included, among others, testing the completeness and accuracy of management’s identification and evaluation of complex or unusual contract terms and conditions by examining revenue contracts on a test basis and evaluating the determination of the impact of those contract terms and conditions on revenue recognition.
Acquisition of Saba - Valuation of Intangible Assets
As described in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, on April 22, 2020, the Company acquired 100% of the equity interests of the direct and indirect subsidiaries of Vector Talent Holdings, L.P., including Saba Software, Inc. (such subsidiaries, collectively, “Saba”), to expand its cloud-based learning, talent management, and talent experience software offerings. The Company acquired Saba for an aggregate purchase price of $1.310 billion, which resulted in $481 million of intangible assets being recorded. Management applied significant judgment in estimating the fair value of intangible assets, which involved the use of significant estimates and assumptions with respect to future subscription revenue (including customer retention rates), operating profit margins associated with such subscription revenues, and discount rates.
The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the acquisition of Saba - valuation of intangible assets is a critical audit matter are (i) the high degree of auditor judgment and subjectivity in applying procedures relating to the fair value measurement of intangible assets acquired due to the significant judgment by management when developing the estimate; (ii) significant audit effort in evaluating the significant assumptions related to future subscription revenue (including customer retention rates), operating profit margins associated with such subscription revenues, and discount rates; and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.
Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the acquisition accounting, including controls over management’s valuation of the intangible assets acquired and controls over development of assumptions related to the future subscription revenue (including customer retention rates), operating profit margins associated with such subscription revenues, and discount rates. These procedures also included, among others, (i) reading the purchase agreement, and (ii) testing management’s process for estimating the fair value of the intangible assets. Testing management’s process included testing the completeness and accuracy of data provided by management, and evaluating the reasonableness of significant assumptions related to future subscription revenue (including customer retention rates), operating profit margins associated with such subscription revenues, and discount rates for the intangible assets. Evaluating the reasonableness of the future subscription revenue (including customer retention rate) and operating profit margins associated with such subscription revenues involved considering the current and past performance of the acquired business, as well as economic and industry forecasts. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in the evaluation of the discount rate assumption.

2.SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Basis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation
The accompanying consolidated financial statements are presented in accordance with accounting standards generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”), and include the accounts of Cornerstone OnDemand, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant inter-company transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. Certain prior period balances have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates, including but not limited to those related to: (i) the realization of tax assets and estimates of tax liabilities and reserves, (ii) the recognition and disclosure of contingent liabilities, (iii) the evaluation of revenue recognition criteria, including the determination of standalone value and estimates of the selling price of multiple-deliverables in the Company’s revenue arrangements, (iv) fair values of investments in marketable securities and strategic investments carried at fair value, (v) the fair values of acquired assets and assumed liabilities in business combinations, (vi) the useful lives of property and equipment, capitalized software, and intangible assets, (vii) impairment of long-lived assets, (viii) the estimated period benefit used for amortization of the commission payments to record to expense, and (ix) determination of the number of shares that are probable of vesting for performance-based restricted stock unit awards (“PRSUs”). These estimates are based on historical data and experience, expectations of future operating performance, and various other factors that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
Business Combinations
The results of businesses acquired in a business combination are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date of the acquisition. Assets and liabilities of an acquired business are recorded at their estimated fair values on the acquisition date. Any excess consideration over the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recognized as goodwill.
The purchase price allocation process requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions. Although the Company believes the assumptions and estimates it has made are reasonable, they are inherently uncertain and based in part on experience, market conditions, projections of future performance, and information obtained from legacy management of acquired companies. Critical estimates include but are not limited to:
•future subscription revenue (including customer retention rates); and, operating profit margins associated with such subscription revenues;
•costs anticipated to fulfill remaining acquired performance obligations and estimated profit margin for such obligations;
•technology migration curves and royalty rates;
•discount rates;
•useful lives assigned to acquired intangibles assets; and
•uncertain tax positions and tax-related valuation allowances assumed.
The identifiable intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over their respective estimated useful lives to sales and marketing for customer-related intangible assets, cost of revenue for developed technology intangible assets, and general and administrative expense for all other intangible assets.
Revenue Recognition
Effective January 1, 2018, the Company adopted the guidance under Topic 606 using a modified retrospective approach. The Company derives its revenue from the following sources:
Subscriptions to the Company’s Products and Other Offerings on a Recurring Basis
Customers pay subscription fees for access to the Company’s enterprise people development solutions, other products, and support on a recurring basis. Fees are based on a number of factors, including the number of products purchased and the number of users having access to a product. The Company generally recognizes revenue from subscriptions ratably over the term of the agreements beginning on the date the subscription service is made available to the customer. Subscription agreements are typically three years, billed annually in advance, and non-cancelable, with payment due within 30 days of the invoice date.
Professional Services and Other
The Company offers its customers and implementation partners assistance in implementing its products and optimizing their use. Professional services include application configuration, system integration, business process re-engineering, change management, and training services. Services are generally billed either upfront on a fixed rate basis, on a time and materials basis, or are included as part of the subscription fee. These services are generally purchased as part of a subscription arrangement and are typically performed within the first several months of the arrangement. Customers may also purchase professional services at any other time. The Company generally recognizes revenue from fixed fee professional services contracts as services are performed based on the proportion performed to date relative to the total expected services to be performed. Revenue associated with time-and-material contracts are recorded as such time-and-materials are incurred. Out-of-pocket travel costs related to the delivery of professional services are typically reimbursed by the customer and are accounted for as revenue in the period in which the cost is incurred.
The Company recognizes revenue from contracts with customers based on the five steps below. The application of these steps may require the use of certain significant estimates and judgments, particularly in identifying and evaluating complex or unusual contract terms and conditions that may impact revenue recognition.
1)Identification of the contract, or contracts, with a customer
2)Identification of all performance obligations in the contract
3)Determination of the transaction price
4)Allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract
5)Recognition of revenue as the Company satisfies a performance obligation
The Company identifies enforceable contracts with a customer when the agreement is signed. Some of the Company’s contracts with customers contain multiple performance obligations. For these contracts, the Company accounts for individual performance obligations separately if they are distinct. The transaction price is allocated to the separate performance obligations on a relative standalone selling price basis. The Company determines the standalone selling prices based on its overall pricing objectives, taking into consideration market conditions and other factors, including the value of its contracts, the products sold, customer demographics, geographic locations, and the number and types of users within the Company’s contracts.
For arrangements in which the Company resells third-party e-learning training content to customers, revenue is recognized at the gross amount invoiced to customers as (i) the Company is primarily responsible for hosting the content on the Company’s solutions for the term of the agreement, (ii) the Company controls the content before access is provided to the customer, and (iii) the Company typically has discretion to establish the price charged.
Deferred Revenue
The Company records amounts that have been invoiced to its customers in accounts receivable and deferred revenue. The Company records revenue once the revenue recognition criteria described above have been met. Deferred revenue that will be recognized during the succeeding twelve-month period from the respective balance sheet date is recorded as current deferred revenue and the remaining portion is recorded as non-current.
Sales Commissions
The Company defers commissions paid to its sales force and related payroll taxes as these amounts are incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer and are recoverable from future revenue due to the non-cancelable customer agreements that gave rise to the commissions. Separate periods of benefit are determined for commissions related to initial contracts and commissions related to renewal contracts. Commissions for initial contracts are deferred in the consolidated balance sheets and amortized on a straight-line basis over a six-year benefit period. The Company takes into consideration technology and other factors in estimating the benefit period. Commissions for renewal contracts are deferred and amortized on a straight-line basis over the related contract renewal period. Amortization expense is included in sales and marketing expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.
Cost of Revenue
Cost of revenue consists primarily of costs related to hosting the Company’s products and delivery of professional services, and includes the following:
•personnel and related expenses, including stock-based compensation;
•expenses for network-related infrastructure and IT support;
•delivery of contracted professional services and ongoing customer support and customer success initiatives;
•payments to external service providers contracted to perform implementation services;
•depreciation of data centers, and amortization of: capitalized software costs, developed technology software license rights, and technology-related intangible assets from acquisitions; and
•content and licensing fees, and referral fees.
In addition, the Company allocates a portion of overhead, such as rent, IT costs, depreciation and amortization, and employee benefits costs, to cost of revenue based on headcount. The costs associated with providing professional services are recognized as incurred when the services are performed. Out-of-pocket travel costs related to the delivery of professional services are typically reimbursed by the customer and are accounted for as cost of revenue in the period in which the cost is incurred.
Research and Development
Research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel and related expenses for the Company’s research and development staff, including salaries, benefits, bonuses, and stock-based compensation; the cost of certain third-party service providers; and allocated overhead. Research and development expenses are expensed as incurred except for certain software development costs which are capitalized when the following criteria are met: the preliminary project stage is completed, management has decided to make the project a part of its future offering and the software will be used to perform the function intended.
Advertising
Advertising expenses for 2020, 2019, and 2018 were $13.0 million, $10.8 million, and $7.1 million, respectively, and are expensed as incurred and recorded within sales and marketing in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.
Stock-Based Compensation
The Company measures and recognizes compensation expense for stock-based awards granted to employees and directors using a fair value method, including restricted stock units (“RSUs”), PRSUs, stock options, and shares purchased under the 2010 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”).
For RSUs, and PRSUs with service and performance conditions, fair value is based on the closing price of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant. For PRSUs with service and market conditions, fair value is estimated using a Monte-Carlo simulation. The Company recognizes compensation expense for PRSUs only if it is probable the performance or market conditions will be met, which is dependent upon its expectations of whether future specified financial targets will be achieved. The likelihood of achievement of these targets is assessed at each balance sheet date. Previously recognized compensation expense may be prospectively adjusted if current expectations differ from assessments made in previous periods. Compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures, is recognized over the requisite service period (which is generally the vesting period) on a straight-line basis for awards with only service conditions and using the accelerated attribution method for awards with both performance or market and service conditions. The Company estimates forfeitures based on its historical experience and regularly reviews the estimated forfeiture rate and makes changes as factors affecting the forfeiture rate calculations and assumptions change.
For stock options and shares purchased under the ESPP, fair value is estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The risk-free interest rate is based on the US Treasury yield in effect during the period the award was granted. The expected term for stock options is determined using a simplified approach in which the expected term of an option is presumed to be the mid-point between the vesting date and the expiration date of the option. The expected term for shares purchased under the ESPP approximates the term of the offering period. The computation of the expected volatility assumption is based on the historical volatility of the Company’s common stock. The dividend yield is assumed to be zero as the Company has not paid and does not expect to pay dividends for the foreseeable future. Compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period.
Due to the valuation allowances provided on a portion of the Company’s net deferred tax assets, the Company has not recorded any significant tax benefit attributable to stock-based compensation expense as of December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018.
Capitalized Software Costs
The Company capitalizes the costs associated with software developed or obtained for internal use, including costs incurred in connection with the development of its products, when the preliminary project stage is completed, management has decided to make the project a part of its future offering and the software will be used to perform the function intended. These capitalized costs include external direct costs of materials and services consumed in developing or obtaining internal-use software, personnel, and related expenses for employees who are directly associated with internal-use software projects. Capitalization of these costs ceases once the project is substantially complete and the software is ready for its intended purpose. Costs incurred for upgrades to the products are also capitalized. Post-configuration training and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred. Capitalized software costs are amortized to cost of revenue using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the software, which is typically three years, commencing when the software is ready for its intended use. The Company does not transfer ownership of or lease its software to its customers.
Income Taxes
The Company uses the liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under the liability method, deferred taxes are determined based on the temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities, using tax rates expected to be in effect during the years in which the basis differences are expected to reverse. A valuation allowance is recorded when it is more likely than not that some of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. In determining the need for valuation allowances, the Company considers projected future taxable income and future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences. The Company has recorded a full valuation allowance to reduce its US, UK, and other net deferred tax assets to zero, as it has determined that it is not more likely than not that any of these net deferred tax assets will be realized based on a history of losses in these jurisdictions. If in the future the company determines that it will be able to realize any of its US, UK, and other net deferred tax assets, it will make an adjustment to the allowance, which would increase income in the period that the determination is made.
The Company has assessed its income tax positions and recorded tax benefits for all years subject to examination, based upon its evaluation of the facts, circumstances, and information available at each period end. For those tax positions where the Company has determined there is a greater than 50% likelihood that a tax benefit will be sustained, the Company has recorded the largest amount of tax benefit that may potentially be realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. For those income tax positions where it is determined there is less than 50% likelihood that a tax benefit will be sustained, no tax benefit has been recognized.
The Company recognizes the US tax effects of global intangible low-taxed income (“GILTI”) as a component of income tax expense in the period the tax arises (the “period cost method”).
Cash and Cash Equivalents
The Company considers all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less on the date of purchase to be cash equivalents.
Restricted Cash
Restricted cash represents escrow accounts established in connection with lease agreements for the Company’s facilities.
Investments in Marketable Securities
The cost of marketable securities is determined based on historical cost through the specific identification method and any realized or unrealized gains or losses on investments are reflected as a component of other income (expense). In addition, the Company classifies marketable securities as current or non-current based upon the maturity dates of the securities.
Strategic Investments
The Company invests in equity securities of various privately-held companies. When the fair value of an investment is not readily determinable, the Company accounts for the investment using the measurement alternative, which is defined as cost, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes. If the Company has significant influence or a controlling financial interest over the entity, the investment is accounted for using the equity method. Under the equity method, the Company records its proportionate share of the equity method investee’s income or loss, net of the effects of any basis differences, to other income (expense) on a one-quarter lag in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. These investments are included in long-term investments in the consolidated balance sheets. Strategic investments are subject to periodic impairment reviews; impairment losses are recorded in other income (expense) in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.
Allowance for Credit Losses
Effective January 1, 2020, the Company adopted guidance under Topic 326 using a modified retrospective approach. The Company bases its expected loss allowance methodology on its historical collection experience, current receivables aging, consideration of current conditions, and other relevant data.
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of allowance for credit losses is as follows (in thousands):
2020 2019 2018
Beginning balance, January 1 $ 1,375 $ 2,429 $ 7,478
Additions and adjustments 7,935 1,074 1,691
Write-offs (4,334) (2,128) (6,740)
Ending balance, December 31 $ 4,976 $ 1,375 $ 2,429
The Company recognized bad debt expense of $3.1 million, $0.5 million, and $0.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. Bad debt expense is recorded in general and administrative expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.
Property and Equipment
Property and equipment are recorded at historical cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method based upon the estimated useful lives of the assets, generally one to eight years (refer to Note 9 - Other Balance Sheet Amounts).
Leasehold improvements are depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives or the term of the lease. Repair and maintenance costs are charged to expense as incurred, while renewals and improvements are capitalized.
Impairment of Long-lived Assets
The Company evaluates the recoverability of its long-lived assets with finite useful lives, including intangible assets, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable. Such triggering events or changes in circumstances may include: a significant decrease in the market price of a long-lived asset, a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which a long-lived asset is being used, a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate, the impact of competition or other factors that could affect the value of a long-lived asset, a significant adverse deterioration in the amount of revenue or cash flows expected to be generated from an asset group, an accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or development of a long-lived asset, current or future operating or cash flow losses that demonstrate continuing losses associated with the use of a long-lived asset, or a current expectation that, more likely than not, a long-lived asset will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life. The Company performs impairment testing at the asset group level that represents the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. If events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset group may not be recoverable and the expected undiscounted future cash flows attributable to the asset group are less than the carrying amount of the asset group, an impairment loss equal to the excess of the asset’s carrying value over its fair value is recorded. Fair value is determined based upon estimated undiscounted future cash flows.
Intangible Assets
Identifiable intangible assets primarily consist of acquisition-related intangibles. The Company determines the appropriate useful life of its intangible assets by performing an analysis of expected cash flows of the acquired assets. Intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives ranging from two to eleven years, generally using the straight-line method which approximates the pattern in which the economic benefits are consumed.
Goodwill
Goodwill is not amortized; it is tested for impairment annually, and more frequently upon the occurrence of certain events. The Company performs such testing of goodwill in the fourth quarter of each year, or as events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount.
Debt
In 2017, the Company issued $300.0 million principal amount of 5.75% senior convertible notes (the “Convertible Notes”) for a purchase price equal to 98% of the principal amount. On April 22, 2020, the Company entered into a credit agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) with Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc., as administrative agent and collateral agent (“Agent”), which provided for a seven-year senior secured term loan B facility (the “Term Loan Facility”) in an aggregate principal amount of $1.0047 billion for a purchase price equal to 97.5% of the aggregate principal amount after original issue discount. The debt discount for each instrument is accreted to interest expense over the respective terms of each loan using the effective interest method. Similarly, debt issuance costs incurred as part of each loan initiation are amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method. Refer to Note 4 - Debt for additional information about the Company’s debt agreements.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
Fair value represents the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal, or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Valuation techniques used to measure fair value must maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. The fair value hierarchy is based on the following three levels of inputs, of which the first two are considered observable and the last one is considered unobservable:
•Level 1 - Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that management has the ability to access at the measurement date.
•Level 2 - Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.
•Level 3 - Unobservable inputs.
Observable inputs are based on market data obtained from independent sources.
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities
Derivatives Designated as Hedging Instruments
As part of the Company’s overall risk management practices, the Company may enter into financial derivatives, such as interest rate swaps which may be designated as cash flow hedges, to hedge the floating interest rate on variable interest rate debt.
The Company records all derivatives in the consolidated balance sheets at fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value of derivatives depends on the intended use of the derivative, whether the Company has elected to designate a derivative in a hedging relationship and to apply hedge accounting, and whether the hedging relationship has satisfied the criteria necessary to apply hedge accounting.
The gain or loss on derivative instruments designated and qualifying for cash flow hedge accounting is deferred in other comprehensive income. The changes in fair value for all trades that are not designated for hedge accounting are recognized in current period earnings. Deferred gains or losses from designated cash flow hedges are reclassified into earnings in the period that the hedged interest expense impacts earnings, as applicable. The effectiveness of cash flow hedges is assessed at inception and quarterly thereafter. The Company does not offset fair value amounts recognized for derivative instruments in its balance sheet for presentation purposes.
Credit risk related to derivative transactions reflects the risk that a party to the transaction could fail to meet its obligation under the derivative contracts. Therefore, the Company’s exposure to the counterparty’s credit risk is generally limited to the amounts, if any, by which the counterparty’s obligations to the Company exceed the Company’s obligations to the counterparty. The Company’s policy is to enter into contracts only with financial institutions which meet certain minimum credit ratings to help mitigate counterparty credit risk.
Foreign Currency Forward Contracts
As part of the Company’s overall risk management practices, the Company may enter into foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate these risks. The Company has not used, nor does it intend to use, these contracts for trading or speculative purposes. The contracts are re-measured to fair value at the end of each reporting period and are not designated as hedging instruments under applicable accounting guidance; therefore, changes in fair value of these contracts are recorded in other, net in the consolidated statements of operations.
Concentration of Risk
The Company’s financial instruments that are exposed to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, debt securities, and accounts receivable. The Company’s deposits exceed federally insured limits. The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers.
For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, no single customer comprised more than 10% of the Company’s revenue. No single customer had an accounts receivable balance greater than 10% of total accounts receivable at December 31, 2020 or 2019.
Foreign Currency Transactions and Translation
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into US dollars at the rates of exchange in effect at the date of the transaction. Unrealized transaction gains were approximately $10.7 million, $1.2 million, and $0.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively, and are included in other, net within other income (expense), in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.
The Company has entities in various countries. For entities where the local currency is different than the functional currency, the local currency financial statements have been remeasured from the local currency into the functional currency using the current exchange rate for monetary accounts and historical exchange rates for non-monetary accounts, with exchange differences on remeasurement included in other, net. To the extent that the functional currency of the Company’s subsidiaries is different than the US dollar, the financial statements have then been translated into US dollars using period-end exchanges rates for assets and liabilities and average exchanges rates for the results of operations. Foreign currency translation gains and losses are included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in the consolidated balance sheets.
Leases
Effective January 1, 2019, the Company adopted guidance under Topic 842 using a modified retrospective approach. The Company has various non-cancelable arrangements to lease office and dedicated data center facility space. These arrangements include services and other incremental costs to maintain or operate the space and do not contain any significant residual value guarantees, significant variable payments, or restrictive covenants.
The Company determines at contract inception whether the arrangement 1) contains a lease based on its ability to control a physically distinct asset for more than 12 months, and 2) should be classified as an operating or finance lease. For both its office and data center facility leases, the Company combines all components of the lease including related services as a single component.
Operating leases are reflected as operating right-of-use (“ROU”) assets and operating lease liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Operating ROU assets represent the Company’s right to use the underlying asset for the lease term. Operating lease liabilities represent the Company’s obligation to make payments arising from the lease. The operating ROU asset also includes any lease payments made and excludes lease incentives. The liabilities are measured at the commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term utilizing an estimated incremental borrowing rate. Lease payments are typically discounted at an estimated incremental borrowing rate as the interest rate implicit in the lease cannot be readily determined in the absence of key inputs which are typically not reported by the Company’s lessors. Judgment was used to estimate the incremental borrowing rate associated with these leases based on relevant market data and Company inputs applied to accepted valuation methodologies.
The Company recognizes lease expense relating to its operating leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term, which commences when the Company controls the leased asset. The lease term includes optional periods to extend or terminate the leases when it is reasonably certain that the option will be exercised. Lease incentives are recognized as a reduction to lease expense on a straight-line basis over the underlying lease term.
In the normal course of operations, the Company enters into subleases for unoccupied leased office space. Any sublease payments received are recognized as a reduction to the related lease expense.
Restructuring
The Company records personnel-related restructuring charges with one-time employee termination benefits when the plan has been communicated to the affected employees and significant changes to the plan are unlikely. The Company records facilities-related restructuring charges ratably over the period of the affected facilities’ remaining expected use, as an incremental increase to the remaining right-of-use asset amortization for the lease(s) exited.
Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements
Effective January 1, 2020, the Company adopted the requirements of Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments (“ASU 2016-13”), using a modified retrospective method of adoption. All amounts and disclosures set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K have been updated to comply with this new standard with results for reporting periods beginning after January 1, 2020 presented under ASU 2016-13, while prior period amounts and disclosures were not adjusted and continue to be reported under the accounting standards in effect for the prior periods. ASU 2016-13 replaces the incurred loss methodology with an expected loss methodology, referred to as current expected credit loss (“CECL”), for financial instruments, including accounts receivable. The cumulative effect of adopting ASU 2016-13 did not have a material impact on the Company’s accumulated deficit as of January 1, 2020. The Company’s expected loss allowance methodology for accounts receivable is developed using historical collection experience, current receivables aging, consideration of current conditions, and other relevant data.
On January 1, 2020, the Company adopted the requirements of Accounting Standards Update No. 2018-15, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other-Internal-Use Software: Customer’s Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement (“ASU 2018-15”), using a prospective method of adoption. ASU 2018-15 aligns the accounting for implementation costs incurred in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract with the accounting for implementation costs incurred to develop or obtain internal-use software under ASC 350-40, in order to determine which costs to capitalize and recognize as an asset and which costs to expense. The adoption did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
Accounting Pronouncements Pending Adoption
In December 2019, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2019-12, Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes (“ASU 2019-12”), which enhances and simplifies various aspects of the income tax accounting guidance. The guidance is effective for the Company in the first quarter of 2021, although early adoption is permitted. The Company believes the adoption of ASU 2019-12 will not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.
3. BUSINESS COMBINATIONS
Saba
On April 22, 2020, the Company acquired 100% of the equity interests of the direct and indirect subsidiaries of Vector Talent Holdings, L.P., including Saba Software, Inc. (such subsidiaries, collectively, “Saba”), to expand its cloud-based learning, talent management, and talent experience software offerings. The Company acquired Saba for an aggregate purchase price of $1.310 billion, consisting of $1.277 billion in cash (net of cash acquired) and 1,110,352 shares of the Company's common stock with an aggregate value of $32.9 million. The acquisition was financed with a combination of cash on hand and proceeds from new borrowings (refer to Note 4 - Debt for further details). Under the terms of the purchase agreement, the final consideration is subject to certain adjustments based on a determination of closing net working capital and net indebtedness (as defined in the purchase agreement). The purchase consideration was allocated to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date with the excess recorded as goodwill, none of which is expected to be deductible for tax purposes. The goodwill is primarily attributable to the acquired workforce and synergies expected to arise after the acquisition, including future technologies and customers of the combined business. The final allocation of purchase consideration to assets and liabilities remains in process as the Company continues to evaluate certain balances, estimates, and assumptions during the measurement period (up to one year from the acquisition date).
The results of operations and the provisional fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed have been included in the consolidated financial statements as of the date of acquisition. During the year ended December 31, 2020, Saba contributed approximately $127 million to revenue. The following table summarizes the preliminary fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as a result of the acquisition of Saba as of April 22, 2020, and subsequent measurement period adjustments recorded during 2020 (in thousands):
Preliminary Fair Value at Acquisition Date Measurement Period Adjustments1

Identifiable Intangible Assets
The following table provides the preliminary valuation of the Saba intangible assets, along with their estimated useful lives:
Estimated Fair Value
(in thousands) Estimated Useful Life
(in years)
Customer relationships $ 294,800 11
Customer contracts 58,500 2
Developed technology 120,500 3 - 5
Trade names, trademarks, and domain names 7,200 3
Total $ 481,000
The identifiable intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over their respective estimated useful lives to sales and marketing for customer-related intangible assets, cost of revenue for developed technology intangible assets, and general and administrative expense for all other intangible assets. Management applied significant judgment in determining the fair value of intangible assets, which involved the use of estimates and assumptions with respect to future subscription revenue (including customer retention rates), operating profit margins associated with such subscription revenues, costs anticipated to fulfill remaining acquired performance obligations and related profit margins, technology migration curves, royalty rates, discount rates, and economic lives assigned to acquired intangible assets.
Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information
The following table presents the unaudited pro forma results for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. The unaudited pro forma financial information combines the results of operations of Cornerstone OnDemand and Saba as though the companies had been combined as of January 1, 2019. The unaudited pro forma information is presented for informational purposes only and is not indicative of the results of operations that would have been achieved if the acquisition had taken place at such time. The unaudited pro forma revenue for the periods presented below include the effects of purchase accounting adjustments related to the valuation of deferred revenue assumed in the acquisition (the “deferred revenue write-down”). The deferred revenue write-down had a $51.4 million impact during the year ended December 31, 2020 ($18.6 million, $19.8 million, and $13.0 million for the second, third, and fourth quarters of 2020, respectively). The unaudited pro forma results presented below also include adjustments for amortization of identifiable intangible assets, interest expense related to debt financing, and related tax effects (in thousands):

Clustree
On January 24, 2020, the Company purchased all of the outstanding shares of Clustree SAS (“Clustree”), a developer of a skills engine and skills ontology. The Company paid cash consideration of approximately $18.6 million. The purchase consideration was allocated to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date with the excess recorded as goodwill, none of which is expected to be deductible for tax purposes. The goodwill generated from this transaction is primarily attributable to the ability to enhance the Company’s product portfolio. The final allocation of purchase consideration to certain assets and liabilities, primarily related to taxes and assumed liabilities, remains in process as the Company continues to evaluate certain estimates and assumptions during the measurement period (up to one year from the acquisition date).
The Company's preliminary allocation of the total purchase consideration as of January 24, 2020 is summarized below:
Fair Value
(in thousands)
Tangible assets $ 1,275
Intangible assets - developed technology
9,800
Intangible assets - customer relationships
Goodwill 8,875
Deferred tax liabilities (1,020)
Accounts payable and accrued expenses (755)
Deferred revenue (336)
Net assets acquired $ 18,639
The intangible assets related to developed technology and customer relationships are amortized on a straight-line basis over three years to cost of revenue and two years to sales and marketing expense, respectively.
Pro forma results of operations related to the acquisition of Clustree have not been presented as the impact of the acquisition is not material to the Company’s financial results.
Acquisition-related and Integration
Acquisition-related and integration expenses for both Saba and Clustree primarily consisted of external fees for advisory, legal, and other professional services associated with the transaction and subsequent integration, and totaled approximately $37.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. These were expensed as incurred and recorded in acquisition-related and integration expenses in the consolidated statements of operations.
4. DEBT
Term Loan B and Revolving Credit Facility
On April 22, 2020, the Company entered into a credit agreement with Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc., as administrative agent and collateral agent, which provided for a seven-year senior secured term loan B facility in an aggregate principal amount of $1.0047 billion for a purchase price equal to 97.5% of the aggregate principal amount after original issue discount. Equity interests in certain subsidiaries of the Company and domestic assets of the Company, subject to customary exceptions, are pledged as collateral. Principal payments are due quarterly, beginning in the fourth quarter of 2020, at a rate of 0.25% of the principal amount; the remaining outstanding principal balance is due in April 2027. In addition, the Company entered into a five-year senior secured revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Credit Facility”) in an aggregate principal amount of up to $150.0 million, of which $102.5 million remained available at December 31, 2020. The available borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility are limited by indebtedness covenants with the holders of the Convertible Notes (as defined below). The Revolving Credit Facility includes a letter of credit sub-facility of up to $30.0 million. Borrowings under the Credit Agreement bear interest at a rate per annum equal to LIBOR for an interest period of one month, plus an applicable margin of 4.25%, with a 0.00% LIBOR floor. The Company uses interest rate swap contracts designated as cash flow hedges to manage its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates. These contracts hedge the variable LIBOR component of the interest rate on the Term Loan Facility and effectively fix the interest rate for the hedged portion of the principal value to 0.28% plus the applicable margin of 4.25% over a stated period of time (refer to Note 10 - Fair Value of Financial Instruments for additional information). Interest is payable on a monthly or quarterly basis at the Company’s option.
The net carrying amounts of the components of the Term Loan Facility consist of the following (in thousands):
December 31, 2020
Principal amount $ 952,188
Unaccreted debt discount (23,082)
Unamortized debt issuance costs (21,392)
Net carrying value $ 907,714
The effective interest rate is 5.3% for the Term Loan Facility as of December 31, 2020.
The following table presents the interest expense recognized related to the Term Loan Facility (in thousands):
Year Ended
December 31, 2020
Contractual interest expense $ 33,249
Accretion of debt discount 2,036
Amortization of debt issuance costs 1,932
Total $ 37,217
Undrawn amounts under the Revolving Credit Facility accrue a commitment fee at an initial per annum rate of 0.50% subject to certain adjustments, beginning July 1, 2020. In addition to the unused commitment fee, the Company is required to pay certain letter of credit and related fronting fees and other administrative fees. The Company did not draw any amounts under the Revolving Credit Facility as of December 31, 2020.
The Term Loan Facility, Revolving Credit Facility, and Convertible Notes (as discussed below) contain customary covenants that, among other things, restrict the Company’s ability to incur additional indebtedness, grant liens, make certain investments (including acquisitions), dispose of certain assets, and make certain payments (including share repurchases and dividends). As of December 31, 2020, the Company was in compliance with all financial covenants.
Convertible Notes
In 2017, the Company issued $300.0 million principal amount of 5.75% senior convertible notes (the “Convertible Notes”) for a purchase price equal to 98% of the principal amount to certain entities affiliated with Silver Lake (a principal owner of the Company) and LinkedIn. The Company received net proceeds of $284.8 million, net of a discount of $6.0 million and issuance costs of $9.2 million. The debt discount is being accreted to interest expense over the term of the Convertible Notes using the effective interest method. The issuance costs were deferred and are being amortized to interest expense over the term of the Convertible Notes using the effective interest method. Interest is payable semi-annually in arrears on January 1 and July 1, commencing January 1, 2018.
The Convertible Notes are convertible at an initial conversion rate of 23.8095 shares of the Company’s common stock per $1,000 principal amount of the Convertible Notes, which represents an initial conversion price of $42.00 per share, subject to adjustment for anti-dilutive issuances, voluntary increases in the conversion rate, and make-whole adjustments upon a fundamental change. A fundamental change includes a change in control, delisting of the Company’s common stock, or a liquidation of the Company. Upon conversion, the Company will deliver the applicable number of the Company’s common stock and cash in lieu of any fractional shares. Holders of the Convertible Notes may convert their Convertible Notes at any time prior to the close of business on the scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date.
The holders of the Convertible Notes may require the Company to repurchase all or a portion of their Convertible Notes at a cash repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes being repurchased, plus the remaining scheduled interest through and including the maturity date, upon a fundamental change or event of default, including non-payment of interest or principal and other obligations.
On April 20, 2020, the Company amended the indenture to the Convertible Notes with US Bank National Association, as trustee (the “Supplemental Indenture”). Upon the completion of the acquisition of Saba on April 22, 2020, the Supplemental Indenture became effective, which permitted the Company to incur additional indebtedness and extended the maturity date of the Convertible Notes from July 1, 2021 to March 17, 2023. In connection with this amendment, the Company paid approximately $3.4 million in consent and other fees to the holders of the Convertible Notes which were capitalized as debt issuance costs. As part of the amendment, the Company applied modification accounting as the criteria requiring extinguishment accounting were not met. As a result of the modification accounting, the fair value of the conversion feature increased by $18.6 million. This increase in fair value was recorded as a debt discount with a corresponding increase to additional paid-in capital. The Company will accrete the debt discount related to the conversion feature and amortize the debt issuance costs related to consent and other fees, including the previously unaccreted and unamortized amounts, to interest expense over the remaining term of the Convertible Notes.
The net carrying amounts of the components of the Convertible Notes consist of the following (in thousands):
December 31, 2020 December 31, 2019
Principal amount $ 300,000 $ 300,000

8. RESTRUCTURING
During 2020, the Company undertook various restructuring activities as part of the Company’s integration plan with Saba to streamline the organization. The activities were composed primarily of workforce reductions and exits of certain facilities. The cost of workforce reductions is primarily composed of severance payments and termination benefits, including stock-based compensation in certain cases. The cost of vacated facilities is primarily composed of incremental amortization associated with ROU assets and associated leasehold improvements and is taken over the remaining period of expected use. The present actions are expected to be substantially complete by the second quarter of 2021. All liabilities for severance and related benefits are included in accrued expenses in the consolidated balance sheets.

At December 31, 2020, the Company had no cash equivalents measured at fair value on a recurring basis. At December 31, 2019, cash equivalents of $148.1 million consisted of money market funds with original maturity dates of three months or less backed by US Treasury bills, as well as corporate bonds, agency bonds, commercial paper, certificates of deposit, and US treasury securities.
At December 31, 2019, corporate bonds, agency bonds, US treasury securities, commercial paper, and asset-backed securities were classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. The instruments were valued using information obtained from pricing services, which obtained quoted market prices from a variety of industry data providers, security master files from large financial institutions, and other third-party sources. The Company performed supplemental analysis to validate information obtained from its pricing services. As of December 31, 2019, no adjustments were made to such pricing information.
During 2020, the Company maintained certain foreign currency forward contracts to manage the Company’s exposure to foreign exchange risk; however, at December 31, 2020, there were no foreign currency forward contracts outstanding. Foreign currency forward contracts are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy and are valued based on quoted foreign exchange rates.
Derivatives Designated as Hedging Instruments - Cash Flow Hedges
The change in fair value of derivatives designated and qualifying as cash flow hedges is deferred as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and is subsequently reclassified into earnings in the period that the hedged interest expense affects earnings. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had two outstanding interest rate swap derivatives designated as hedging instruments with an aggregate notional value of $667.8 million. These contracts have maturities of five years or less with amortizing notional values over the contract term.
The following table summarizes the amount of income recognized from derivative instruments and the line items in the accompanying statements of operations where the results were recorded for cash flow hedges (in thousands):

The Company’s Convertible Notes, as described in Note 4 - Debt, are presented in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets at their original issuance value, net of unaccreted debt discount and unamortized debt issuance costs, and are not remeasured to fair value each period. The fair value of the Company’s Convertible Notes as of December 31, 2020 was approximately $395 million. The fair value of the Convertible Notes, which are classified as Level 2 financial instruments, was estimated on the basis of the current equity value implicit in the instrument.
11. STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY
Capitalization
As of December 31, 2020, the Company’s authorized stock consists of 1,000,000,000 shares of common stock, par value of $0.0001 per share, and 50,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value of $0.0001 per share. As of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 there were 64,926,234 and 61,037,517 shares issued and outstanding, respectively. No shares of preferred stock were issued or outstanding at December 31, 2020 and 2019.
Share Repurchase Programs
In August 2019, the Company’s board of directors authorized a $150.0 million share repurchase program of its common stock. The 2019 Share Repurchase Program is set to terminate when the aggregate cost of shares repurchased under the 2019 Share Repurchase Program reaches $150.0 million. Share repurchases may be executed through various means, including, without limitation, open market transactions, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. The timing and amount of any share repurchase will depend on share price, corporate and regulatory requirements, economic and market conditions, and other factors. At January 1, 2021, shares representing $127.6 million remained available for repurchase under the 2019 Share Repurchase Program.
The following is a summary of activity under all of the Company’s repurchase programs (in thousands):

12. STOCK-BASED AWARDS
2010 Plan
In March 2011, the Company adopted the 2010 Stock Plan (“2010 Plan”) and ceased granting awards under the stock plans adopted in 1999 and 2009. The plans adopted in 1999 and 2009 continue to govern the terms and conditions of the outstanding awards previously granted under each respective plan. The maximum number of shares of common stock to be added to the 2010 Plan from the plans adopted in 1999 and 2009 is 5,614,369. The 2010 Plan was amended and restated in 2019. The amended and restated 2010 Plan removed the provision which allowed for an annual increase of shares available for issuance on the first day of each fiscal year beginning with 2012 and ending with 2019, by an amount equal to the lesser of 5,500,000 shares, 4.5% of the outstanding shares of the Company’s common stock as of the last day of the immediately preceding fiscal year, or such other amount as the Company’s board of directors determined.
Shares issued pursuant to awards under the 2010 Plan that are repurchased by the Company or that expire or are forfeited, as well as shares used to pay the exercise price of an award or to satisfy the minimum tax withholding obligations related to an award, will become available for future grant or sale under the 2010 Plan. In addition, to the extent that an award is paid out in cash rather than shares, such cash payment will not reduce the number of shares available for issuance under the 2010 Plan.
The 2010 Plan permits the grant of incentive stock options to employees and the grant of non-statutory stock options, restricted stock, RSUs, stock appreciation rights, performance units, and performance shares to the Company’s employees, directors, and consultants.
Under the 2010 Plan, 3,825,712 shares remained available for issuance at December 31, 2020.
Stock Options
Stock options vest upon achievement of service conditions. The exercise price of stock options granted under the 2010 Plan must equal at least the fair market value of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant. The term of an incentive stock option may not exceed ten years. The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.

On a consolidated basis, the Company has incurred operating losses and has recorded a full valuation allowance against its US, UK, and other deferred tax assets for all periods to date and, accordingly, has not generally recorded a (benefit) provision for income taxes for any of the periods presented other than a (benefit) provision for certain foreign and state income taxes. Certain foreign subsidiaries and branches of the Company provide intercompany services and are compensated on a cost-plus basis, and therefore, have incurred liabilities for foreign income taxes in their respective jurisdictions. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, a tax provision benefit was realized from the reversal of valuation allowance on existing deferred tax assets. Such benefit also included amounts realized in connection with the recording of deferred tax liabilities from the acquisition of Saba, which was attributable to the reversal of $26.7 million of a portion of the Company’s US federal and state valuation allowance on deferred tax assets.

Net deferred tax assets $ 7,233 $ 1,045
At December 31, 2020, the Company had federal, state, and foreign net operating losses of approximately $515.1 million, $488.3 million, and $249.1 million, respectively. The federal net operating loss carryforward will begin expiring in 2021, the state net operating loss carryforward will begin expiring in 2021, and the foreign net operating loss will begin expiring in 2021. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, imposes substantial restrictions on the utilization of net operating losses in the event of an “ownership change” of a corporation. Accordingly, a company’s ability to use net operating losses may be limited as prescribed under Internal Revenue Code Section 382 (“IRC Section 382”). Events which may cause limitations in the amount of the net operating losses that the Company may use in any one year include, but are not limited to, a cumulative ownership change of more than 50% over a three-year period. Due to the effects of historical equity issuances, the Company has determined that the future utilization of a portion of its net operating losses is limited annually pursuant to IRC Section 382.
The Company has recorded a full valuation allowance against its otherwise recognizable US, UK, and other deferred income tax assets as of December 31, 2020. Management has determined, after evaluating all positive and negative historical and prospective evidence, that it is more likely than not that these assets will not be realized. There was a net increase (decrease) to the valuation allowance of $4.9 million, $(0.1) million, and $(1.5) million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively.
Deferred income taxes have not been provided on the undistributed earnings of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries because the Company’s practice and intent is to permanently reinvest these earnings. The cumulative amount of such undistributed earnings was $29.8 million and $5.3 million at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. Any future distribution of these non-US earnings may subject the Company to state income taxes, as adjusted for tax credits, and foreign withholding taxes that the Company estimates would be $0.8 million and $0.1 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows (in thousands):
Year Ended December 31,
2020 2019 2018
Balance at January 1 $ - $ 1,402 $ 1,271
Additions from acquisitions 5,161 - -
Decreases attributable to lapse of statute of limitations (223) - -
Increases for tax positions related to the prior year 144 - 131
Decreases for tax positions related to the prior year (49) (1,402) -
Balance at December 31 $ 5,033 $ - $ 1,402
The Company’s policy is to classify interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions as a component of tax expense. The Company does not expect the change in uncertain tax positions to have a material impact on its financial position, results of operations, or liquidity. The recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits on uncertain tax positions would result in a $2.6 million tax benefit. The Company does not expect any significant increases or decreases to its unrecognized tax benefits within the next twelve months.
The Company is subject to US federal income tax as well as to income tax in multiple state and foreign jurisdictions, including the UK. Federal income tax returns of the Company are subject to IRS examination for the 2017 through 2020 tax years. State income tax returns are subject to examination for the 2016 through 2020 tax years.
There are no ongoing audits in any significant foreign tax jurisdictions.
14. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
Commitments
In March 2020, the Company entered into an agreement with a provider of cloud computing services to provide services over approximately seven years. The remaining obligation as of December 31, 2020 is $79.5 million.
Letters of Credit
The Company maintains standby letters of credit in association with other contractual arrangements. Total letters of credit outstanding at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 were $8.9 million and $8.3 million, respectively.
Guarantees and Indemnifications
The Company has made guarantees and indemnities under which it may be required to make payments to a guaranteed or indemnified party, in relation to certain transactions, including revenue transactions in the ordinary course of business. The Company is obligated to indemnify its directors and officers to the maximum extent permitted under the laws of the State of Delaware. However, the Company has a directors and officers insurance policy that may reduce its exposure in certain circumstances and may enable it to recover a portion of future amounts that may be payable, if any. The duration of the guarantees and indemnities varies and, in many cases, is indefinite but subject to statutes of limitations. To date, the Company has made no payments related to these guarantees and indemnities. The Company estimates the fair value of its indemnification obligations as insignificant based on this history and the Company’s insurance coverage and therefore has not recorded any liability for these guarantees and indemnities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
Litigation
The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business. If the Company determines that it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable, the Company will record a liability. The Company has determined that it does not have any liabilities that are reasonably possibly related to any legal proceedings or claims that would individually or in the aggregate materially adversely affect its financial condition or operating results.
Taxes
From time to time, various federal, state, and other jurisdictional tax authorities undertake review of the Company and its filings. In evaluating the exposure associated with various tax filing positions, the Company accrues charges for possible exposures. The Company believes any adjustments that may ultimately be required as a result of any of these reviews will not be material to its consolidated financial statements. The Company believes that adequate amounts of tax, related penalties, and interest have been provided in income tax expense for any adjustments that may result from its uncertain tax positions. The Company is unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period in which these tax liabilities might be paid.
15. LEASES
The Company has various non-cancelable operating leases for its offices and its data centers. These arrangements have remaining lease terms ranging from 1 year to 12 years. Certain lease agreements contain renewal options, termination rights, rent abatement, and/or escalation clauses with renewal terms that can extend the lease term from 1 year to 5 years or more.

16.DEFERRED REVENUE AND REMAINING PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS
The Company recognized $335.7 million and $311.8 million of revenue during the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, that was included in the deferred revenue balances as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
Transaction Price Allocated to Remaining Performance Obligations
As of December 31, 2020, approximately $1.254 billion of revenue is expected to be recognized from remaining performance obligations. The Company expects to recognize revenue on approximately 70% of these remaining performance obligations over the next 18 months, with the balance recognized thereafter.
The estimated revenues from the remaining performance obligations do not include uncommitted contract amounts such as (i) amounts which are cancellable by the customer without significant penalty, (ii) future billings for time and material contracts, and (iii) amounts associated with optional renewal periods.
17. SEGMENT AND GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION

18. 401(K) SAVINGS PLAN
The Company has a defined contribution savings plan (the “Plan”) under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. The Plan covers substantially all employees who meet minimum age and service requirements and allows participants to defer a portion of their annual compensation on a pre-tax basis. Company contributions to the Plan may be made at the discretion of the Board of Directors. The Plan provides for a Company matching contribution in an amount equal to 50% of an employee’s contributions up to $2,400 per year, which vests fully after the fourth year of employment.
The Company incurred approximately $2.7 million, $2.2 million, and $2.0 million of matching contribution expenses related to the Plan during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively.
19. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
The Cornerstone OnDemand Foundation (the “Foundation”) empowers communities in the US and internationally by increasing the impact of the non-profit sector through the utilization of people development technology including the Company’s products. The Company’s founder and co-chairman of the board is on the board of directors of the Foundation. The Company does not direct the Foundation’s activities, and accordingly, the Company does not consolidate the Foundation’s statement of activities with its financial results. During the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, the Company provided at no charge certain resources to the Foundation, with approximate values of $3.3 million, $3.5 million, and $3.7 million, respectively.","Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure
None.","Item 9A. Controls and Procedures
(a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
The term “disclosure controls and procedures,” as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), refers to controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that such information is accumulated and communicated to a company’s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Our management, with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2020, the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Based upon such evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of such date.
(b) Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of our consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:
•pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets;
•provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and board of directors; and
•provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of any unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect financial statement misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of internal control effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Our management, with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, has assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013). In accordance with guidance issued by the staff of the US Securities and Exchange Commission, companies are permitted to exclude acquisitions from their final assessment of internal control over financial reporting for the first fiscal year in which the acquisition occurred. Our management’s evaluation of internal control over financial reporting excluded the internal control activities of Saba, which we acquired in April 2020. The total assets, excluding goodwill and identifiable intangible assets, and total revenues of Saba represent approximately 7.0% and 17.1%, respectively, of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020. Based on the results of our evaluation, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2020.
The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in its report, which appears in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
(c) Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
We acquired Saba in April 2020 and are in the process of integrating the acquired business into our overall internal control over financial reporting. Other than this ongoing integration, there was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2020 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.","Item 9B. Other Information
On February 17, 2021, the Compensation Committee of our board of directors established an executive compensation plan for fiscal year 2021 (the ""2021 Plan"") as part of our annual review of target incentive compensation for our executive officers.
Under the terms of the 2021 Plan, each of the eligible executive officers will be entitled to receive a bonus that will vary in amount depending on our success in achieving certain performance targets with respect to annual recurring revenue and operating income. The amount payable with respect to each metric may be greater or less depending on the extent to which our performance exceeds or falls short of the applicable target. No bonus payout for a particular performance metric will be earned unless the performance threshold for that metric is met. The 2021 Executive Bonus Plan is filed as Exhibit 10.25 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS.
Company Overview
Issuer Direct Corporation and its subsidiaries are hereinafter collectively referred to as “Issuer Direct”, the “Company”, “We” or “Our” unless otherwise noted. Our corporate offices are located at One Glenwood Ave., Suite 1001, Raleigh, North Carolina, 27603.
We announce material financial information to our investors using our investor relations website, SEC filings, investor events, news and earnings releases, public conference calls, webcasts and social media. We use these channels to communicate with our investors and the public about our company, our products and services and other related matters. It is possible that information we post on some of these channels could be deemed to be material information. Therefore, we encourage investors, the media and others interested in Issuer Direct to review the information we post to all our channels, including our social media accounts.
We are a premier provider of communications and compliance technology solutions that are designed to help organizations tell their stories globally. Our principal platform, Platform id.™, empowers users by thoughtfully integrating the most relevant tools, technologies and products, thus eliminating the complexity associated with producing and distributing their business communications and financial information. Platform id. efficiently and effectively helps our customers manage their events when seeking to distribute their messaging to key constituents, investors, markets and regulatory systems around the globe. Platform id. consists of several related but distinct communications and compliance modules that companies utilize every quarter.
As our cloud-based subscription business continues to mature, we expect the communications portion of our business to continue to increase over the next several years, both in terms of overall revenue and as compared to the compliance portion of our business. Therefore, as noted below, we have begun to report our revenue as Communications and Compliance revenues rather than Platform & Technology and Services revenues as we have done in the past. Communications revenues grew to 64% of total revenue during 2020, compared to 57% and 45% of our revenue for the years ending December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. In 2020, growth from our Communications business was led by the market demands for our events products that were upgraded to handle virtual needs in the industry, as well as our ACCESSWIRE news brand, which drove both subscriptions and pay-as-you-go revenues higher than in prior years.
We plan to continue to invest in our Platform id. communications offerings as well as additional offerings that we intend to incorporate into our Communications product lineup. Within most of our target markets, customers require several individual services and/or software providers to meet their investor relations, communications and compliance needs. We believe Platform id. can address all these needs in a single, secure, cloud-based platform - one that offers a customer control, increases efficiencies, demonstrates clear value and, most importantly, delivers consistent and compliant messaging from one centralized platform.
We work with a diverse customer base, which includes not only corporate issuers and private companies, but also investment banks, professional firms, such as investor relations and public relations firms, as well as the accounting and legal communities. Our customers and their service providers utilize Platform id. and related solutions from document creation all the way to dissemination to regulatory bodies, news outlets, financial platforms and our customer’s shareholders. Private companies primarily use our news distribution and webcasting products and services to disseminate their message globally. Platform id.’s intelligent subscription platform guides thousands of customers through the process of communicating their message to a large audience.
We also work with several select stock exchanges by making available certain parts of our platform under agreements to integrate our offerings within their products. We believe such partnerships will continue to yield increased exposure to a targeted customer base that could impact our revenue and overall brand in the market.
In the past we have disclosed revenues in two main categories: (i) Platform and Technology and (ii) Services. However, to be more reflective of our strategy of primarily being a communications company, we have decided to re-categorize and disclose our revenues in the following two main categories: (i) Communications and (ii) Compliance. Set forth below is an infographic depicting the products included in each of these two main categories we provide today:
Communications
Our communications platform consists of our newswire, ACCESSWIRE, our webcasting and events business, professional conference and events software, as well as our investor relations website technology. These products are sold as the leading part of our Platform id. subscription, as well as individually to customers around the globe and further described below.
ACCESSWIRE
Our press release offering, which is marketed under the brand ACCESSWIRE, is a cost-effective, news dissemination and media outreach service. The ACCESSWIRE product offering focuses on press release distribution for both private and public companies globally. We believe ACCESSWIRE is becoming a competitive alternative to the traditional newswires because we have been able to use our technological advancements to allow customers to self-edit releases or use our editorial staff as desired to edit releases. We also continue to expand our distribution points, improve our targeting and enhance our analytics reporting. During 2020 we released a new e-commerce element to our ACCESSWIRE product, whereby customers can self-select their distribution and then register, upload their press release and tell their story in minutes without contacting a sales or operational employee.
We believe the above strategy will enable us to continue to add new customers in 2021 and beyond. We have also been able to maintain high gross margins while providing our customers flexible pricing, with options to pay per release or enter longer-term, flat-fee subscriptions. Currently, ACCESSWIRE is available within our Platform id. subscription, or as a stand-alone offering.
Like other newswires globally, ACCESSWIRE is dependent upon several key partners for its news distribution. Disruption in any of our partnerships could have a materially adverse impact on ACCESSWIRE and our overall business.
ACCESSWIRE revenues and customers have increased each year compared to the prior year, a trend we expect to continue over the next several years. A significant portion of the growth has been due to increased private company customers, through either direct sales, e-commerce or through partner and reseller relationships.
Webcasting & Events
Our webcasting and events business is comprised of our earnings call webcasting solutions and our virtual meeting and events software (such as annual meetings, deal/non-deal road shows, analyst days and shareholder days). The demands for these products with a virtual component were at an all-time high for us in 2020 in large part due to the COVID-19 pandemic, something we expect will continue for the majority of 2021, although, there can be no assurances this high demand will continue in the future.
Traditional earnings calls and webcasts are a highly competitive space with the majority of the business being driven from practitioners in investor relations and communications firms. We estimate there are approximately 5,000 companies in North America conducting earnings events each quarter that include a teleconference, webcast or both as part of their events. Platform id. also incorporates other elements of the earnings event, including earnings date/call announcement, earnings press release and SEC Form 8-K filings. There are a handful of our competitors that can offer this integrated full-service solution today. However, we believe our real-time event setup and integrated approach offers a more effective way to manage the process, as well, as attract an audience of investors.
We have also attempted to differentiate our offering by investing in developing and integrating systems and processes within Platform id. and creating an application programming interface (“API”). This API allows customers, such as financial content sites and investment banks, to query an industry or a single company’s current and past earnings calls and present those webcasts on their platforms. Initially, this has been broadly distributed via our Investor Network platform, with expectations that customers will license this dataset for their platforms in the future. We believe this offering will further increase our brand awareness.
Additionally, as a commitment to broadening the reach of our webcast platform, we broadcast live all earnings events, whether they are conducted on our platform or not, within our shareholder outreach module, which helps drive new audiences and give companies the ability to view their analytics and engagement of each event. We believe these analytics, which will be a component of our Insight and Analytics module, will increase the demand for our webcasting platform among the corporate issuer community.
Our VisualWebcaster Platform (“VWP”) is a leading cloud-based webcast, webinar and virtual meeting platform that delivers live and on-demand streaming of events to audiences of all sizes. VWP allows customers to create, produce and deliver events, which we feel integrates well into Platform id. We believe by acquiring VWP we have significantly strengthened our webcasting product and Platform id. offering as well as acquired over 120 customers, ranging from small private companies to Fortune 500 companies. The VWP technology gives us the ability to host thousands of additional webcasts each year, expanding and diversifying our webcast business from our historical earnings-based events to include any type of virtual event. As we expand our platform, it is vital for us to have solutions that service both our core public companies but also a growing segment of private customers. As a result of COVID-19, most companies have been holding meetings virtually over the past 12 months, which has increased demand for this product. There can be no assurance that this demand will continue after the end of the pandemic.
Professional Conference and Events Software
At the end of 2018, we released a new module to Platform id., centered around the professional conference organizer (“PCO”). This subscription offering is being licensed to investor conference organizers, which in the aggregate we believe held an estimated 1,000 plus events a year prior to 2020. This number significantly decreased in 2020 and is expected to remain at significantly decreased numbers in the near future and possibly long-term as a result of COVID-19. Our professional conference and events software, which is available as a mobile app, offers organizers, issuers and investors the ability to register, request and approve one-on-one meetings, manage schedules, perform event promotion and sponsorship, print attendee badges and manage lodging. This cloud-based product can be used in a virtual or in person conference setting and is integrated within Platform id. to enhance our communications module subscription offerings of newswire, newsrooms, webcasting and shareholder targeting. We believe this integration gives us a unique offering for PCOs that is not available elsewhere in the market.
We believe entering this business expands our current communications revenue base, and as an adjacency, should assist in making Platform id. a platform of choice for investment banks, issuers and investors.
Investor Relations Websites
Our investor relations content network is another component of Platform id., which is used to create the investor relations’ tab of a company’s website. This investor relations content network is a robust series of data feeds including news feeds, stock feeds, fundamentals, regulatory filings, corporate governance and many other components which are aggregated from most of the major exchanges and news distribution outlets around the world. Customers can subscribe to one or more of these data feeds or as a component of a fully designed and hosted website for pre-IPO companies, SEC reporting companies and partners seeking to display our content on their corporate sites. The clear benefit to our investor relations content network is its integration into Platform id. As such, companies can produce content for public distribution and it is automatically linked to their corporate website, distributed to targeted groups and placed into our data feed partners.
As what we believe to be a natural expansion to our investor relations website business, we are developing what is known as a “corporate newsroom” in the communications industry, which we plan to expect to bring to market during the year. This product offering will be an add-on to any customer’s ACCESSWIRE account and or their Platform id. subscription. Our intent is to leverage the technology we have in our investor relations content business and focus a module toward all companies, to assist in making their corporate news, media kits and alerts available from our ecosystem to their corporate website.
Compliance
Our compliance offerings consist of our disclosure software for financial reporting as well as our stock transfer agency, and related annual meeting, print and shareholder distribution services. Some of these products are sold as part of a Platform id. subscription as well as individually to customers around the globe.
Compliance Software and Services
Platform id.’s disclosure reporting module is a document conversion, editing and filing offering which is designed for reporting companies and professionals seeking to insource the document drafting, editing and filing processes to the SEC’s EDGAR system. Our compliance business also offers companies the ability to use our in-house staff to assist in the conversion, tagging and filing of their documents. We generate revenues in compliance both from software and services and, in most cases, customers have both components within their annual agreements, while others pay for services as they are completed.
Toward the end of 2017, we completed upgrades to our disclosure reporting product to include tagging functionality that meets newly mandated SEC disclosure requirements under Inline XBRL (Inline Extensible Business Reporting Language or “iXBRL”). These requirements will impact most of our customers for the fiscal periods ending on or after June 15, 2021, however, we have had a number of customers already file using our iXBRL upgrades.

Our whistleblower hotline is an add-on product within Platform id. This system delivers secure notifications and basic incident workflow management processes that align with a company’s corporate governance whistleblower policy. As a supported and subsidized bundle product of the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) offerings, we are introduced to new IPO customers and other larger cap customers listed on the NYSE.
Stock Transfer Module
A valued subscription add-on in our Platform id. offering is the ability for our customers to gain access to real-time information about their shareholders, stock ledgers and reports and to issue new shares from our cloud-based stock transfer module. Managing the capitalization table of a public company or pre-IPO company is a cornerstone of corporate governance and transparency, and as such companies and community banks have chosen us to assist with their stock transfer needs, including bond offerings and dividend management. This is an industry which has experienced declining overall revenues as it was affected by the replacement of paper certificates with digital certificates. However, we have been focused on selling subscriptions of the stock transfer component of our platform, allowing customers to gain access to our cloud-based system in order to move shares or query shareholders, which we believe has resulted in a more efficient process for both our customers and us.
Annual Meeting / Proxy Voting Platform
During early 2020, we upgraded our webcasting and annual meeting platform to bring to market a virtual annual meeting solution. This solution provides our customers the ability to conduct their annual meetings in a fully virtual manner considering the constraints caused by COVID-19. Our solution incorporates shareholder and guest registration, voting integration, real-time stats on attendance, audio video and presentation features as well as fully managed meeting managers and inspector of elections.
By adding a component of our webcasting and events business, we were able to offer a complete annual meeting solution, which resulted in us becoming one of the top technology providers of virtual annual meetings in 2020, which incorporated real-time voting. In perspective, during 2019, approximately 300 North American public companies opted for a virtual component to their annual meeting compared to an estimated 4,000+ companies in 2020.
Our proxy module is marketed as a fully integrated, real-time voting platform for our customers and their shareholders of record. This module is utilized for every annual meeting or special meeting we manage for our customers and offers both full-set mailing and notice of internet availability options.
Shareholder Distribution
Over the past few years, we have worked on refining the model of digital distribution of our customers’ message to the investment community and beyond. This was accomplished by integrating our shareholder outreach module, Investor Network, into and with Platform id. Most of the customers subscribing to this module today are historical PrecisionIR (“PIR”) - Annual Report Service (“ARS”) users, as well as new customers purchasing the entire Platform id. subscription. We migrated some of the customers from the traditional ARS business into this new digital subscription business, however, we continue to operate a portion of this legacy physical hard copy delivery of annual reports and prospectuses for customers who opt to take advantage of it. We continue to see customer attrition for customers who subscribe to both the electronic and physical distribution of reports as a stand-alone product.
Our overall strategy includes:
Expansion of Current Customers
We expect to continue to see demand for our products within our customer base and in the industries we serve. As we continue to transition from a services-oriented business, our focus is to migrate customer contracts over to subscription-based contracts for our entire Platform id. offering. We believe this will help us move from a transaction-based revenue model to a recurring subscription-based revenue model, which may give us more consistent, predictable revenue patterns and hopefully create longer lasting customer relationships. Additionally, as part of our customer expansion efforts, we are committed to working beyond the single point of contact and into the entire C suite (CEO, CFO, IRO, Corporate Secretary, etc.) of an organization which we believe will help drive subscription revenues per customer.
Focus on Organic Growth
Our primary growth strategy continues to be selling our communications solutions to new customers under a subscription arrangement, whereas in the past we were inclined to sell a single point solution. Selling a subscription to Platform id. allows us to provide our customers with a competitively priced, complete solution for their communications needs. Our strategy of selling our cloud-based offerings via Platform id. to all customers under a subscription agreement should benefit us by moving away from selling individual solutions within highly commoditized markets that are experiencing pricing pressures.
New Offerings
During 2021 and going forward, we will continue to innovate, improve and build new applications into and with our platform, with the objective of developing integrated application solutions that are not offered by our competitors. As a company focused on technology offerings, we understand the importance of advancements and fully appreciate the risks and consequences of losing our market position. The pursuit of technological innovation is and has been a part of our overall strategy as an organization over the last several years.
Each year we bring to market certain platform upgrades, add-ons, and new offerings that we believe will complement our overall platform solutions. We believe our innovation and technological efficiencies continue to be a competitive advantage and focus for us.
Part of our continued strategy from 2020 will be to continue to meet the virtual event market demands, in both our conference business, annual meeting business and shareholder communications business. We benefited during 2020 in each of these businesses and expect this year’s product advancements to continue to benefit us throughout the year as a result of the continued public gathering restrictions which have been caused by COVID-19.
We also have a slate of product platform enhancements beginning in the first quarter of 2021 that will help our customers stay connected with their shareholder and constituent base. Specifically, these advancements will be centered around the creation process of a story, whereby we will be adding a real-time collaboration suite into the ACCESSWIRE process. We also plan to enhance the ability of users to request, book and hold meetings within our virtual events products. Additionally, we have other strategic upgrades to Platform id., such as the corporate newsroom mentioned above, that we believe will both increase customer retention and annual revenue per customer.
Acquisition Strategy
We will continue to evaluate complimentary verticals and businesses that we can integrate into our communications platform. While we typically focus on accretive acquisition opportunities, we will also evaluate technology acquisitions that we believe would be strategic to our overall business. We will continue to maintain our acquisition focus in the communications industry. Specifically, we will look for communications products and businesses that have recurring revenues, customers and technologies that will further enhance our overall market position.
Sales and Marketing
During 2020, we continued to strengthen our brands in the market by working aggressively to expand our new customer footprint and continue to cross sell to increase average revenue per customer. Since our platform, systems and operations are built to handle growth, we can leverage them to produce consistently high margins and increased cash flows without a proportional increase in our capital or operating expenses.
Our sales organization is responsible for generating new customer opportunities and expanding our current customers. We ended 2020 with a multi-tier organization of sales personnel, consisting of Sales Development Representatives, Business Development Managers and Strategic Account Managers. During 2020, we created a new inbound digital sales and marketing group to manage all inbound leads and focus on e-commerce and digital marketing relating to the portions of our platform we believe may be attractive for online purchases. We believe this structured approach is the most efficient and effective way to reach new customers and grow our current install base. The total compensation packages for these teams are heavily weighted with commission compensation to incent sales and retention. All members of the sales team have quotas. As of December 31, 2020, we employed 29 full-time equivalent sales and marketing personnel compared to 25 as of December 31, 2019.
Our marketing organization has been focused on both new customer acquisition as well as campaigns to educate current customers on the advantages of using our entire Platform id. offerings. Additionally, our marketing team has expanded their focus on investor conferences, strategic partnerships and private company marketing activities in order to continue to scale our business long term.
Cybersecurity
In all our offerings, quality, support, and scalability as well as the need to preserve the confidential content of our customers are of utmost importance and part of our core values. We continue to maintain agreements with security software and hardware providers and consulting firms to identify, address and create policies and plans which enable us to mitigate our cybersecurity and information vulnerabilities on both a short-term and long-term basis. We believe having a strong cyber and information security policy is not only necessary to maintain our current business model but also is important to attract new customers. We plan to continue to work closely with these firms and others to ensure our security policies and practices meet our customers’ needs and requirements.
Industry Overview
According to a 2020 Burton-Taylor Media Intelligence report, the global communications technology market is almost $5 billion in annual revenue. This total includes spending on social media solutions, media monitoring, press release distribution engagement and targeting and investor relations platforms globally. A key driver of growth in our industry is the introduction of new innovative technologies and solutions. We believe our technology and workflow automation solutions will help us gain market share within the industry.
The webcasting and virtual event side of the communications industry was greatly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic as demand significantly increased for virtual events due to cancelled live, in-person events, meetings and conferences. Toward the end of the first quarter of 2020, we began enhancing our products by adding virtual components, as well as focusing our selling efforts on our webcasting technologies.
Our industry also benefits from increased regulatory requirements and the need for platforms and systems to manage these new regulations. Additionally, the industry, along with cloud-based technologies, have matured considerably over the past several years, whereby corporate issuers and communication professionals are seeking platforms and systems to do some, if not all the work themselves. We believe we are well positioned in this new environment to benefit from subscriptions and further advancements of Platform id.
The compliance industry is highly fragmented, with hundreds of independent service companies that provide a range of financial reporting, document management services. There is also a wide range of printing and technology software providers. The demands for many of our services historically have been cyclical and reliant on capital market activity. Over the past few years, we have been offering subscriptions which combine both compliance software and service in one annual contract. We believe this new offering affords us the ability to reduce our revenue seasonality and provide a new baseline of recurring annualized revenue.
Competition
Despite some significant consolidation in recent years, the communications and compliance industries remain both highly fragmented and extremely competitive. The success of our products and services are generally based on price, quality and the ability to service customer demands. Management has been focused on offsetting these risks relating to competition as well as the seasonality by introducing our cloud-based subscription platforms, with higher margins, clear competitive advantages, higher customer stickiness and scalability to withstand market and pricing pressures.
We also review our operations on a regular basis to balance growth with opportunities to maximize efficiencies and support our long-term strategic goals. We believe by blending our workflow technologies with our legacy service offerings we can offer a comprehensive set of products and solutions to each of our customers within one platform that most competitors cannot offer today.
We believe we are positioned to be the communications platform of choice as a cost-effective alternative to both small regional providers and global providers. We also believe we benefit from our location in Raleigh, North Carolina, as we can hire and retain sales, customer service or production personnel in the area at a reasonable cost. However, there are areas we have strong competition in hiring, such as research and development and qualified sales individuals with communications industry experience.
Customers
Our customers include a wide variety of public and private companies, mutual funds, law firms, brokerage firms, investment banks, individuals, and other institutions. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we worked with 2,242 publicly traded customers and 4,426 private customers, compared to 2,169 publicly traded customers and 2,691 private customers for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in private companies is primarily related to additional agencies we began to partner with during the year as well as direct sales to private companies in our newswire business. We did not have any customers during the year ended December 31, 2020 that accounted for more than 10% of our revenue or more than 10% of our year end accounts receivable balance as of December 31, 2020.
Employees
As of December 31, 2020, we employed eighty-six employees and engaged five independent contractors, none of which are represented by a union. Our employees work in our corporate offices in North Carolina and in other offices throughout North America.
Facilities
Our headquarters are located in Raleigh, North Carolina. In October 2019, we began a new lease for 9,766 square feet of office space, which expires December 31, 2027.
As part of our acquisition of VWP, we assumed a three-year lease in Ft. Lauderdale, Florida, and a month-to-month lease in New York City, New York. Additionally, we have an office in Salt Lake City, Utah, which is also on a short-term lease. As a result of an increase in our remote workforce, we are examining the needs for these satellite locations and have already vacated the New York City office after year-end. The Company intends to monitor the needs of its employees both in a remote and on-site basis and will make the necessary adjustments to its locations on that basis.
Insurance
We maintain both a general business liability, cyber-security and an errors and omissions policies specific to our industry and operations. We believe that our insurance policies provide adequate coverage for all reasonable risks associated with operating our business. Additionally, we maintain a Directors and Officers insurance policy, which is standard for our industry and size. We also maintain key person life insurance on our C level executives, and one other key individual.
Regulations
The securities and financial services industries generally are subject to regulation in the United States and elsewhere. Regulatory policies in the United States and the rest of the world are tasked with safeguarding the integrity of the securities and financial markets and with protecting the interests of both issuers and shareholders.
In the United States, corporate issuers are subject to regulation under both federal and state laws, which often require public disclosure and regulatory filings. At the federal level, the SEC regulates the securities industry, along with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, or FINRA, formally known as NASD, and NYSE market regulations, various stock exchanges, and other self-regulatory organizations (“SRO”).
In the European Union (EU), the securities and reporting authorities tend to be based on exchanges as well as individual country disclosure requirements. We currently work with our stock exchange partners to deliver our solutions. We believe this is the best approach as this market is highly complex and divided in comparison to our North American markets.
We operate our filing agent business and transfer agent business under the supervision and regulations of the SEC.
Our transfer agency business, Direct Transfer, LLC, is registered with the SEC and is subject to SEC regulations relating to, among other things, annual reporting, examination, internal controls, tax reporting and escheatment services. Our transfer agency is currently approved to handle the securities of NYSE, NASDAQ and OTC Markets.
Our mission is to assist corporate issuers with these regulations, communication and compliance of rules imposed by regulatory bodies. The majority of our business involves the distribution of content, either electronically or on paper, to governing bodies and shareholders alike. We are recognized under these regulations to disseminate, communicate and or solicit on behalf of our customers, the issuers.","ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.
Forward-Looking and Cautionary Statements
Investing in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. Prospective investors should carefully consider the following risks and uncertainties and all other information contained or referred to in this Annual Report on Form 10-K before investing in our common stock. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of, or that we currently deem immaterial, also may become important factors that affect us. If any of the following risks occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. In that case, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you could lose some or all of your investment.
Risks related to our business
Legislative and regulatory changes can influence demand for our solutions and could adversely affect our business.
The market for our solutions depends in part on the requirements of the SEC and other regulatory bodies. Any legislation or rulemaking substantially affecting the content or method of delivery of documents to be filed with these regulatory bodies could have an adverse effect on our business. In addition, evolving market practices in light of regulatory developments could adversely affect the demand for our solutions. Uncertainty caused by political change in the United States and European Union heightens regulatory uncertainty in these areas. For example, the SEC has proposed a rule to require certain over-the-counter (“OTC”) companies to provide greater transparency to investors and other market participants by requiring that information about the issuer be current and publicly available, which could cause a decrease in the number of publicly traded companies. New legislation, or a significant change in rules, regulations, directives or standards could reduce demand for our products and services. Regulatory changes could also increase expenses as we modify our products and services to comply with new requirements and retain relevancy, impose limitations on our operations, and increase compliance or litigation expense, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
The environment in which we compete is highly competitive, which creates adverse pricing pressures and may harm our business and operating results if we cannot compete effectively.
Competition across all of our businesses is intense. The speed and accuracy with which we can meet customers’ needs, the price of our services and the quality of our products and supporting services are factors in this competition.
Some of our competitors have longer operating histories, greater name recognition, more established customer bases and significantly greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources than we do. As a result, they may be able to respond more quickly and effectively than we can to new or changing market demands and requirements. We could also be negatively impacted if our competitors reduce prices, add new features, form strategic alliances with other companies, or are acquired by other companies with greater available resources.
These competitive pressures to any aspect of our business could reduce our revenue and earnings.
Our revenue growth rate in the recent period relating to our Communications business may not be indicative of this business segment’s future performance.
We experienced a revenue growth rate of 28% from 2019 to 2020, 45% from 2018 to 2019, 22% from 2017 to 2018 and 55% from 2016 to 2017 with respect to our Communications business. In 2020, much of the growth came from demand for our events products that were upgraded to handle virtual needs in the industry, as well as our ACCESSWIRE news brand, which drove both subscriptions and pay-as-you-go revenues higher than in prior years. In 2019, much of the growth came from the acquisition of VWP in January 2019 and FSCwire in July 2018, while the previous years’ growth was due to the success of our ACCESSWIRE business. Our historical revenue growth rate of the Communications business is not indicative of future growth, and we may not achieve similar revenue growth rates in future periods. You should not rely on our revenue or revenue growth for any prior quarterly or annual periods as any indication of our future revenue or revenue growth. If we are unable to maintain consistent revenue or revenue growth, it may be difficult to achieve and maintain profitability and our stock price may be negatively impacted.
The success of our cloud-based software largely depends on our ability to provide reliable solutions to our customers. If a customer were to experience a product defect, a disruption in its ability to use our solutions or a security flaw, demand for our solutions could be diminished, we could be subject to substantial liability and our business could suffer.
Our product solutions are complex and we often release new features. As such, our solutions could have errors, defects, viruses or security flaws that could result in unanticipated downtime for our customers and harm our reputation and our business. Internet-based software may contain undetected errors or security flaws when first introduced or when new versions or enhancements are released. We might from time to time find such defects in our solutions, the detection and correction of which could be time consuming and costly. Since our customers use our solutions for important aspects of their business, any errors, defects, disruptions in access, security flaws, viruses, data corruption or other performance problems with our solutions could hurt our reputation and may damage our customers’ businesses. If that occurs, customers could elect not to renew, could delay or withhold payment to us or may make claims against us, which could result in an increase in our provision for doubtful accounts, an increase in collection cycles for accounts receivable or the expense and risk of litigation. We could also lose future sales. In addition, a security breach of our solutions could result in our future business prospects being materially adversely impacted.
A substantial portion of our business is derived from our ACCESSWIRE brand, which is dependent on technology and key partners.
As noted, our ACCESSWIRE brand has been vital to the increase in revenue associated with our Communications business. ACCESSWIRE is dependent upon several key partners for news distribution, some of which are also partners that we rely on for other shareholder communications services. During the second quarter of 2019, one of our key partners made an industry-wide decision to no longer accept investor commentary content. A significant portion of our historical ACCESSWIRE revenue was generated from this type of content, which has significantly affected revenue going forward. Further disruption in any of these partnership relationships could have a material adverse impact on our business and financial results and the inability to procure new key partners could impact the growth of the ACCESSWIRE brand, particularly with respect to public company news distribution. Additionally, ACCESSWIRE is highly dependent on technology and any performance issues with this technology could have a material impact on our ability to serve our customers and thus our ability to generate revenue.
Failure to manage our growth may adversely affect our business or operations.
Since 2013, we have experienced overall growth in our business, customer base, employee headcount and operations, and we expect to continue to grow our business over the next several years. This growth places a significant strain on our executive management team and employees and on our operating and financial systems. To manage our future growth, we must continue to scale our business functions, improve our financial and management controls and our reporting systems and procedures and expand and train our work force. In particular, we grew from twenty-four employees and contractors as of December 31, 2012 to ninety-one (including 5 independent contractors) as of December 31, 2020. We anticipate that additional investments in sales personnel, infrastructure and research and development spending will be required to:
●
scale our operations and increase productivity;
●
address the needs of our customers;
●
further develop and enhance our existing solutions and offerings; and
●
develop new technology.
We cannot assure you that our controls, systems and procedures will be adequate to support our future operations or that we will be able to manage our growth effectively. We also cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to expand our market presence in the United States and other current markets or successfully establish our presence in other markets. Failure to effectively manage growth could result in difficulty or delays in deploying customers, declines in quality or customer satisfaction, increases in costs, difficulties in introducing new features or other operational difficulties, and any of these difficulties could adversely impact our business performance and results of operations.
If we are unable to retain our key employees and attract and retain other qualified personnel, our business could suffer.
Our ability to grow and our future success will depend to a significant extent on the continued contributions of our key executives, managers and employees. In addition, many of our individual technical and sales personnel have extensive experience in our business operations and/or have valuable customer relationships that would be difficult to replace. Their departure, if unexpected and unplanned, could cause a disruption to our business. Our competition for these individuals is intense in certain areas of our business. We may not succeed in identifying and retaining the appropriate personnel in key positions. Further, competitors and other entities have in the past recruited and may in the future attempt to recruit our employees, particularly our sales personnel. The loss of the services of our key personnel, the inability to identify, attract and retain qualified personnel in the future or delays in hiring qualified personnel, particularly technical and sales personnel, could make it difficult for us to manage our business and meet key objectives, such as the timely introduction of new technology-based products and services, which could harm our business, financial condition and operating results
The recent COVID-19 outbreak could harm our business and results of operations.
On January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak a ""Public Health Emergency of International Concern"" and on March 11, 2020, declared it to be a pandemic. We have undertaken measures to protect our employees, partners and customers by requiring a majority of our employees to work remotely at certain times. There can be no assurance that these measures will be effective or that we can adopt them without adversely affecting our business operations. In addition, the COVID-19 outbreak has created and may continue to create significant uncertainty in global financial markets, which may materially decrease spending, demand for our solutions, the viability of our customers and the value of our assets, which would significantly harm our business and results of operations. The ultimate extent of the impact of any epidemic, pandemic or other health crisis in our business, financial condition and results of operations will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted.
If we fail to keep our customers’ information confidential or if we handle their information improperly, our business and reputation could be significantly and adversely affected.
If we fail to keep customers’ proprietary information and documentation confidential, we may lose existing customers and potential new customers and may expose them to significant loss of revenue based on the premature release of confidential information. While we have security measures in place to protect customer information and prevent data loss and other security breaches, these measures may be breached as a result of third-party action, employee error, malfeasance or otherwise. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not identified until they are launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures.
In addition, our service providers (including, without limitation, hosting facilities, disaster recovery providers and software providers) may have access to our customers’ data and could suffer security breaches or data losses that affect our customers’ information.
If an actual or perceived security breach or premature release occurs, our reputation could be damaged and we may lose future sales and customers. We may also become subject to civil claims, including indemnity or damage claims in certain customer contracts, or criminal investigations by appropriate authorities, any of which could harm our business and operating results. Furthermore, while our errors and omissions insurance policies include liability coverage for these matters, if we experienced a widespread security breach that impacted a significant number of our customers for whom we have these indemnity obligations, we could be subject to indemnity claims that exceed such coverage.
We must adapt to rapid changes in technology and customer requirements to remain competitive.
The market and demand for our products and services, to a varying extent, have been characterized by:
●
technological change;
●
frequent product and service introductions; and
●
evolving customer requirements.
We believe that these trends will continue into the foreseeable future. Our success will depend, in part, upon our ability to:
●
enhance our existing products and services;
●
gain market acceptance.
●
successfully develop new products and services that meet increasing customer requirements; and
To achieve these goals, we will need to continue to make substantial investments in sales and marketing. We may not:
●
have sufficient resources to make these investments;
●
be successful in developing product and service enhancements or new products and services on a timely basis, if at all; or
●
be able to market successfully these enhancements and new products once developed.
Further, our products and services may be rendered obsolete or uncompetitive by new industry standards or changing technology.
Our business could be harmed if we do not successfully manage the integration of any business that we have acquired or may acquire in the future. These risks include, among other things:
●
the difficulty of integrating the operations and personnel of the acquired businesses into our ongoing operations;
●
the potential disruption of our ongoing business and distraction of management;
●
the potential for new cyber security risks to existing operations that weren’t previously mitigated:
●
the difficulty in incorporating acquired technology and rights into our products and technology;
●
unanticipated expenses and delays relating to completing acquired development projects and technology integration;
●
a potential increase in our indebtedness and contingent liabilities, which could restrict our ability to access additional capital when needed or to pursue other important elements of our business strategy;
●
the management of geographically remote units;
●
the establishment and maintenance of uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies;
●
the impairment of relationships with employees and customers as a result of any integration of new management personnel;
●
risks of entering markets or types of businesses in which we have either limited or no direct experience;
●
the potential loss of key employees or customers of the acquired businesses; and
●
potential unknown liabilities, such as liability for hazardous substances, or other difficulties associated with acquired businesses.
Revenue from Platform id. subscriptions and many of our service contracts is recognized ratably over the term of the contract or subscription period. As a result, downturns or upturns in sales may not be immediately reflected in our operating results.
We generally recognize subscription and support revenue from customers ratably over the terms of their subscription agreements, which are typically on a quarterly or annual cycle and automatically renew for additional periods. As a result, a substantial portion of the revenue we report in each quarter will be derived from the recognition of deferred revenue relating to subscription agreements entered into during previous quarters. Consequently, a decline in new or renewed subscriptions in any one quarter may not be immediately reflected in our revenue results for that quarter. This decline, however, will negatively affect our revenue in future quarters. Accordingly, the effect of significant downturns in sales and market acceptance of our solutions and potential changes in our rate of renewals may not be fully reflected in our results of operations until future periods. Our subscription model also makes it difficult for us to rapidly increase our subscription revenue through additional sales in any period, as revenue from new customers must be recognized over the applicable subscription term. In addition, we may be unable to adjust our cost structure to reflect the changes in revenue, which could adversely affect our operating results.
We cannot accurately predict subscription renewal or upgrade rates and the impact these rates may have on our future revenue and operating results.
Our business depends substantially on customers renewing their subscriptions with us, specifically Platform id., and expanding their use of our products. Our customers have no obligation to renew their subscriptions for our products after the expiration of their initial subscription period. Given our limited operating history with respect to our subscription business, we may be unable to accurately predict our revenue retention rate. In addition, our customers may renew for shorter contract lengths, lower prices or fewer users. We cannot accurately predict new subscription or expansion rates and the impact these rates may have on our future revenue and operating results. Our renewal rates may decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including customer dissatisfaction with our service, customers’ ability to continue their operations and spending levels and deteriorating general economic conditions. If our customers do not renew their subscriptions for our products, purchase fewer solutions at the time of renewal, or negotiate a lower price upon renewal, our revenue will decline and our business will suffer. Our future success also depends in part on our ability to sell additional solutions and products, more subscriptions or enhanced editions of our products to our current customers. If our efforts to sell additional solutions and products to our customers are not successful, our growth and operations may be impeded. In addition, any decline in our customer renewals or failure to convince our customers to broaden their use of our products would harm our future operating results.
We continue to transition our business from a services company to a cloud-based platform company, which makes it difficult to predict our future operating results.
In 2015, we began our transition from a services company to a cloud-based platform company. As a result of this transition, our ability to forecast our future operating results is limited and subject to a number of uncertainties, including our ability to plan for and model future growth. We have encountered and will encounter risks and uncertainties frequently experienced by growing companies in rapidly changing industries, such as the risks and uncertainties described herein. If our assumptions regarding these risks and uncertainties (which we use to plan our business) are incorrect or change due to changes in our markets, or if we do not address these risks successfully, our operating and financial results could differ materially from our expectations and our business could suffer.
We are subject to general litigation and regulatory requirements that may materially adversely affect us.
From time to time, we may be involved in disputes or regulatory inquiries that arise in the ordinary course of business. We expect that the number and significance of these potential disputes may increase as our business expands and we grow larger. While most of our agreements with customers limit our liability for damages arising from our solutions, we cannot assure you that these contractual provisions will protect us from liability for damages in the event we are sued. Although we carry general liability insurance coverage, our insurance may not cover all potential claims to which we are exposed or may not be adequate to indemnify us for all liability that may be imposed. Any claims against us, whether meritorious or not, could be time consuming, result in costly litigation, require significant amounts of management time, and result in the diversion of significant operational resources. Because litigation is inherently unpredictable, we cannot assure you that the results of any of these actions will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
New and existing laws make determining our sales and use taxes and income tax rate complex and subject to uncertainty.
The computation of sales and use taxes and our provision for income tax is complex, as it is based on the laws of multiple taxing jurisdictions and requires significant judgment on the application of complicated rules governing accounting for such tax provisions under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Additionally, provisions for income tax for interim quarters are based on forecasts of our U.S. and non-U.S. effective tax rates for the year and contain numerous assumptions. Various items cannot be accurately forecasted and future events may be treated as discrete to the period in which they occur. Our provision for income tax can be materially impacted by things such as changes in our business, internal restructuring and acquisitions, changes in tax laws and accounting guidance and other regulatory, legislative developments, tax audit determinations, changes in uncertain tax positions, tax deductions attributed to equity compensation and changes in our determination for a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets. For all of these reasons, our actual income taxes may be materially different than our provision for income tax.
We are subject to U.S. and foreign data privacy and protection laws and regulations as well as contractual privacy obligations, and our failure to comply could subject us to fines and damages and would harm our reputation and business.
We manage private and confidential information and documentation related to our customers’ finances and transactions, often prior to public dissemination. The use of insider information is highly regulated in the United States and abroad, and violations of securities laws and regulations may result in civil and criminal penalties. In addition, we are subject to the data privacy and protection laws and regulations adopted by federal, state and foreign legislatures and governmental agencies. Data privacy and protection is highly regulated and may become the subject of additional regulation in the future. Privacy laws restrict our storage, use, processing, disclosure, transfer and protection of non-public personal information by our customers or collected from visitors of our website. We strive to comply with all applicable laws, regulations, policies and legal obligations relating to privacy and data protection. However, it is possible that these requirements may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another and may conflict with other rules or our practices. Any failure, or perceived failure, by us to comply with federal, state or international laws, including laws and regulations regulating privacy, payment card information, personal health information, data or consumer protection, could result in proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or others.
The regulatory framework for privacy and data protection issues worldwide is evolving, and various government and consumer agencies and public advocacy groups have called for new regulation and changes in industry practices, including some directed at providers of mobile and online resources in particular. Our obligations with respect to privacy and data protection may become broader or more stringent. If we are required to change our business activities or revise or eliminate services, or to implement costly compliance measures, our business and results of operations could be harmed.
Our business may be affected by factors outside of our control.
Our ability to increase sales and deliver and sell our service offerings profitably is subject to a number of risks, including changes to corporate disclosure requirements, regulatory filings and distribution of proxy materials, competitive risks such as the entrance of additional competitors into our market, pricing and competition and risks associated with the marketing of new services in order to remain competitive.
If potential customers take a long time to evaluate the use of our products, we could incur additional selling expenses and decrease our profitability.
The acceptance of our services depends on a number of factors, including the nature and size of the potential customer base, the effectiveness of our system, and the extent of the commitment being made by the potential customer, and is difficult to predict. Currently, our sales and marketing expenses per customer are fairly low. If potential customers take longer than we expect to decide whether to use our services and require that we travel to their sites, present more marketing material, or spend more time in completing the sales process, our selling expenses could increase, and decrease our profitability.
The seasonality of business makes it difficult to predict future results based on specific quarters.
A greater portion of our printing, distribution and solicitation of proxy materials business will be processed during the second quarter of our fiscal year. Therefore, the seasonality of our revenue makes it difficult to estimate future operating results based on the results of any specific quarter and could affect an investor’s ability to compare our financial condition and results of operations on a quarter-by-quarter basis. To balance the seasonal activity of print, distribution and solicitation of proxy materials, we will attempt to continue to grow other revenues linked to predictable periodic activity that is not cyclical in nature.
If we are unable to successfully develop and timely introduce new technology-based products or enhance existing technology-based products, our business may be adversely affected.
In the past few years, we have expended significant resources to develop and introduce new technology-based products and improve and enhance our existing technology-based products in an attempt to maintain or increase our sales. The long-term success of new or enhanced technology-based products may depend on a number of factors including, but not limited to, the following: anticipating and effectively addressing customer preferences and demand, the success of our sales and marketing efforts, timely and successful development, changes in governmental regulations and the quality of or defects in our products.
The development of our technology-based products is complex and costly, and we typically have multiple technology-based products in development at the same time. Given the complexity, we occasionally have experienced, and could experience in the future, delays in completing the development and introduction of new and enhanced technology-based products. Problems in the design or quality of our products or services may also have an adverse effect on our brand, business, financial condition, and operating results. Unanticipated problems in developing technology-based products could also divert substantial development resources, which may impair our ability to develop new technology-based products and enhancements of such products, and could substantially increase our costs. If new or enhanced product and service introductions are delayed or not successful, we may not be able to achieve an acceptable return, if any, on our development efforts, and our business may be adversely affected.
Risks Related to Our Common Stock; Liquidity Risks
The price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly, which could lead to losses for stockholders.
The stock prices of smaller public companies can experience extreme price and volume fluctuations. These fluctuations often have been unrelated or out of proportion to the operating performance of such companies. We expect our stock price to be similarly volatile. These broad market fluctuations may continue and could harm our stock price. Any negative change in the public’s perception of our prospects or companies in our market could also depress our stock price, regardless of our actual results. Factors affecting the trading price of our common stock may include:
●
variations in operating results;
●
announcements of strategic alliances or significant agreements by the Company or by competitors;
●
recruitment or departure of key personnel;
●
litigation, legislation, regulation of all or part of our business; and
●
changes in the estimates of operating results or changes in recommendations by any securities analyst that elect to follow our common stock.
If securities or industry analysts issue an adverse opinion regarding our stock, our stock price and trading volume could decline.
The trading market for our common stock is influenced by the research and reports that securities or industry analysts may publish about us, our business, our market or our competitors. If any of the analysts who may cover us adversely change their recommendation regarding our common stock, or provide more favorable relative recommendations about our competitors, the trading price of our common stock could decline. If any analyst who may cover us were to cease coverage of our company or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause the trading price of our common stock or trading volume to decline.
The market price of our common stock may be adversely affected by market conditions affecting the stock markets in general, including price and trading fluctuations on the NYSE American.
Market conditions may result in volatility in the level of, and fluctuations in, market prices of stocks generally and, in turn, our common stock and sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the market, in each case being unrelated or disproportionate to changes in our operating performance. A weak global economy could also contribute to extreme volatility of the markets, which may have an effect on the market price of our common stock.
We do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future.
We paid dividends in 2012, part of 2013 and from the fourth quarter of 2015 through the third quarter of 2018. In the fourth quarter of 2018, we announced that we would no longer be declaring quarterly dividends for the foreseeable future in order to invest such money in our business. There can be no assurances that dividends will be paid in the future in the form of either cash or stock.
Our Board of Directors has the ability without stockholder approval to issue shares of preferred stock with terms detrimental to the holders of our common stock.
We currently have authorized but unissued “blank check” preferred stock. Without the vote of our shareholders, the Board of Directors may issue such preferred stock with both economic and voting rights and preferences senior to those of the holders of our common stock. Any such issuances may negatively impact the ultimate benefits to the holders of our common stock in the event of a liquidation event and may have the effect of preventing a change of control and could dilute the voting power of our common stock and reduce the market price of our common stock.
Future sales and issuances of our capital stock or rights to purchase capital stock could result in additional dilution of the percentage ownership of our stockholders and could cause our stock price to decline.
Our certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue up to 20,000,000 shares of common stock. Future sales and issuances of our capital stock or rights to purchase our capital stock could result in substantial dilution to our existing stockholders. We may sell common stock, convertible securities and other equity securities in one or more transactions at prices and in a manner as we may determine from time to time. If we sell any such securities in subsequent transactions, investors may be materially diluted, which could result in downward pressure on the price of our common stock. New investors in subsequent transactions could gain rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock. In addition, if outstanding stock options are exercised or when outstanding restricted stock units are settled in shares, current shareholders will experience dilution.
We will continue to incur significantly increased costs and devote substantial management time as a result of operating as a public company.
As a public company, we incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses that would not be incurred as a private company. For example, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange Act), and are required to comply with the applicable requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the Dodd-Frank Act, as well as rules and regulations subsequently implemented by the SEC and the New York Stock Exchange, including the establishment and maintenance of effective disclosure and financial controls and changes in corporate governance practices. Compliance with these requirements has increased our legal and financial compliance costs and made some activities more time consuming and costly. Many of these costs recur annually. As a result, management’s attention may be diverted from other business concerns, which could adversely affect our business and operating results.
A failure to maintain adequate internal controls over our financial and management systems could cause errors in our financial reporting, which could cause a loss of investor confidence and result in a decline in the price of our common stock.
The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. In order to maintain and, if required, improve our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting to meet this standard, significant resources and management oversight may be required. If we have a material weaknesses or significant deficiency in our internal control over financial reporting, we may not detect errors on a timely basis and our financial statements may be materially misstated. Effective internal controls are necessary for us to produce reliable financial reports and are important to prevent fraud. As a result, our failure to satisfy the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act on a timely basis could result in us being subject to regulatory action and a loss of investor confidence in the reliability of our financial statements, both of which in turn could cause the market value of our common stock to decline and affect our ability to raise capital.
Because we are a smaller reporting company, our independent registered public accounting firm was not required to and did not perform an audit of our internal control over financial reporting for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020.","ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS.
None.","ITEM 2. PROPERTY.
Our headquarters are located in Raleigh, North Carolina. In October 2019, we began a new lease for 9,766 square feet of office space, which expires December 31, 2027.
As part of our acquisition of VWP, we assumed a three-year lease in Ft. Lauderdale, Florida, and a month-to-month lease in New York City, New York. Additionally, we have an office in Salt Lake City, Utah, which is also on a short-term lease. As a result of an increase in our remote workforce, we are examining the needs for these satellite locations and have already vacated the New York City office after year-end. The Company intends to monitor the needs of its employees both in a remote and on-site basis and will make the necessary adjustments to its locations on that basis.","ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.
From time to time, we may be involved in litigation that arises through the normal course of business.

COMPARISON OF CUMULATIVE TOTAL RETURN
Performance Comparison Graph
This chart compares the five-year cumulative total return on our common stock with that of the Russell MicroCap index and a custom peer group, which was selected by the Company. The chart assumes $100 was invested on December 31, 2015, in our common stock, the Russell MicroCap index and the peer group, and that any dividends were reinvested. The Peer Group is composed of: Broadridge Financial Solutions Inc., Donnelley Financial Solutions, Inc., and Workiva, Inc. The peer group index utilizes the same method of presentation and assumptions for the total return calculation as does Issuer Direct Corporation (ISDR) and the Russell MicroCap index. All companies in the peer group index are weighted in accordance with their market capitalizations.
The Company makes no representation to the peer group market caps being similar to that of Issuer Direct, however these peers do represent a fair and accurate list of the companies that Issuer Direct competes with that are in fact public.

Revenues
Total revenue increased by $2,231,000, or 14%, to $18,526,000 during the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to $16,295,000 in 2019. The increase is attributable to an increase in revenue in our Communications business.
Communications revenue increased $2,623,000, or 28%, to $11,870,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to $9,247,000 during 2019. The increase in revenue is due to a combination of increased revenue from our webcasting, conference software and newswire products, as well as increased licenses of Platform id. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we benefited from our ability to pivot and enhance our products with virtual components, including virtual annual meetings, virtual conferences and enhanced webcasting features to allow banks to conduct virtual roadshows, analyst days and other types of events. Additionally, ACCESSWIRE revenue for the year increased 17% compared to the same period of the prior year due to an increase in customers and the implementation of our new e-commerce platform. Revenue from licenses of Platform id. increased as a result of the additional licenses signed during the year as we entered into 139 new licenses of Platform id. with annual contract value of $1,007,000. This brings our total subscriptions of Platform id. to 341 with annual contract value of $2,677,000 as of December 31, 2020, compared to 255 subscriptions with annual contract value of $2,033,000 as of December 31, 2019. Communications revenue increased to 64% of total revenue during the year, as compared to 57% during the same period of the prior year.
Compliance revenue decreased $392,000, or 6%, during the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to 2019. The decrease in revenue is due to continued customer attrition of our legacy ARS services as well as a decline in transfer agent services due to a combination of less corporate transactions and directives, as well as an increased shift from paper-based processing of transactions to electronic processing. These decreases were partially offset by increases in print and proxy fulfillment, due to increased projects associated with annual meetings, as a result of the increased demand for our virtual annual meeting product.
2020 Revenue Backlog
As of December 31, 2020, our deferred revenue balance was $2,212,000, a majority of which we expect to recognize over the next twelve months, compared to $1,812,000 at December 31, 2019, an increase of 22%. Deferred revenue primarily consists of advance billings for subscriptions of our cloud-based products and pre-paid packages of our news distribution product, as well as, advance billings for annual contracts for legacy ARS services.
Cost of Revenues
Communications cost of revenues consists primarily of direct labor costs, newswire distribution costs, teleconferencing costs and third-party licensing costs. Compliance and other costs of revenue consists primarily of direct labor costs, warehousing, logistics, print production materials, postage, and amortization of capitalized software costs related to our compliance software. Cost of revenues increased by $335,000, or 7%, during the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the same period of 2019. Overall gross margin increased $1,896,000, or 17%, during the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to 2019. As a result, overall gross margin percentage increased to 71% during the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to 69% during the prior year. The increase in cost of sales is due partially to an increase labor costs associated with delivering our newswire and webcasting revenue, increase in distribution costs as we continue to expand our distribution capabilities as well as increase in teleconferencing costs. These increases were offset by decreases in amortization of capitalized software as well as decreases in postage and fulfillment costs associated with our legacy ARS business.
Gross margin percentage associated with our Communications revenue was 73% for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to 72% for 2019. The increase in gross margin percentage is primarily attributable to the addition of revenue associated with our virtual products, newswire and subscriptions of Platform id.
Gross margin percentage associated with our Compliance revenue was 66% for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to 65% for 2019.
General and Administrative Expense
General and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries, stock-based compensation, insurance, fees for professional services, general corporate expenses and facility and equipment expenses. General and administrative expenses were $5,029,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020, a decrease of $57,000 or 1%, as compared to the prior year. This decrease is primarily due to a decrease in our bad debt provision of $449,000 offset by a one-time accrual of $350,000 recorded in 2020 regarding sales and use tax compliance. As a result of our growing customer base, transition from a service-based company to a cloud-based platform company and the complex economic nexus provisions of various states, we completed an assessment of our sales and use tax position during the year. As a result, we recorded a one-time estimate of our current and historical state sales and use tax liabilities of approximately $350,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020. The high bad debt provision in the prior year was primarily related to reserves on accounts receivable balances of two significant investment commentary newswire customers which were written off in 2019.
As a percentage of revenue, General and Administrative expenses were 27% for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to 31% for 2019.
Sales and Marketing Expenses
Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries, stock-based compensation, sales commissions, advertising expenses, tradeshow expenses and other marketing expenses. Sales and marketing expenses were $3,812,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $261,000, or 7%, as compared to the prior year. This increase is directly related to our investment in our sales and marketing initiatives with an increase in headcount and digital marketing.
As a percentage of revenue, sales and marketing expenses were 21% for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to 22% for 2019.
Product Development
Product development expenses consist primarily of salaries, stock-based compensation, bonuses and licenses to develop new products and technology to complement and/or enhance Platform id. Product development costs decreased $394,000, or 32%, to $825,000 during the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to 2019. The decrease is due to a decrease in headcount within the development team and use of more specialized consultants. We anticipate product development expenses to begin to increase toward previous levels in future periods.
As a percentage of revenue, Product Development expenses were 4% for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to 7% for 2019.
Depreciation and Amortization
During the year ended December 31, 2020, depreciation and amortization expenses decreased by $134,000, or 15%, to $751,000, as compared to $885,000 during 2019. The decrease is primarily related to intangible assets associated with the acquisition of PIR that became fully amortized during the year.
Other income, net
Other income, net, primarily relates to an $80,000 gain on extinguishment of debt associated with the final anniversary payment related to the acquisition of Interwest Transfer Company (“Interwest”) in 2017 as well as interest income on deposit and money market accounts. These items are partially offset by the non-cash interest associated with the present value of the anniversary payments of the Interwest acquisition.
Income Taxes
We recorded income tax expense of $724,000 during the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $109,000 during the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in income tax expense is attributable to higher pre-tax income for the year ended December 31, 2020. The difference between the Company’s effective tax rate of 26% and the federal statutory rate of 21% is primarily due to state taxes for 2020.
During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company’s effective tax rate was favorably impacted by the research and development tax credit, foreign tax credits as well as a benefit related to the exercise of stock-based compensation. The aforementioned reasons, as well as state taxes, foreign statutory tax rate differentials are the reasons for the variance between the Company’s effective tax rate and the statutory rate during 2019.
Net Income
Net income for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $2,106,000 as compared to $686,000 in 2019. The increase in net income is primarily due to the growth of our Communications revenue and higher gross margin percentages. Additionally, we experienced lower operating expenses which were partially offset by a decline in interest income and higher income taxes.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
As of December 31, 2020, we had $19,556,000 in cash and cash equivalents and $2,514,000 in net accounts receivable. Current liabilities as of December 31, 2020, totaled $4,494,000 including our accounts payable, deferred revenue, accrued payroll liabilities, income taxes payable, current portion of lease liabilities and other accrued expenses. At December 31, 2020, our current assets exceeded our current liabilities by $17,789,000.
Effective October 3, 2019, the Company renewed its Line of Credit, which increased the term to two years, with all other provisions remaining the same. The amount of funds available for borrowing are $3,000,000 and the interest rate is LIBOR plus 1.75%. As of December 31, 2020, the interest rate was 1.89% and the Company did not owe any amounts on the Line of Credit.
Disclosure about Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We do not have any transactions, agreements or other contractual arrangements that constitute off-balance sheet arrangements.
Outlook
The following statements and certain statements made elsewhere in this document are based upon current expectations. These statements are forward looking and are subject to factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those suggested here, including, without limitation, demand for and acceptance of our services, new developments, competition and general economic or market conditions, particularly in the domestic and international capital markets. Refer also to the Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward Looking Statements included in this report.
On January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak a ""Public Health Emergency of International Concern"" and on March 11, 2020, declared it to be a pandemic. Actions taken around the world to help mitigate the spread of COVID-19 include restrictions on travel, quarantines or “stay-at-home” restrictions in certain areas and forced closures for certain types of public places and businesses. COVID-19 and actions taken to mitigate it have had and are expected to continue to have an adverse impact on the economies and financial markets globally, including the geographical areas in which we operate. Although our offices were initially ordered temporarily closed for the safety of our employees, their families and our community, on June 1, 2020 we began slowly re-opening our offices, which are now open for all employees who voluntarily elect to return to the office.
While it is unknown how long these conditions will last, including whether a worldwide resurgence will occur, variants of the virus will become more impactful or vaccines will be effective, and what the complete financial impact will be to the Company, we could experience a material disruption of our employees and operations, a decline in revenue, a decline in value of our assets, deterioration of our customer base and the inability of our customers to pay for subscriptions or services provided. To date, we have seen both positive and negative impacts to our business. Several in-person conferences scheduled to occur in the first half of the year were either cancelled or delayed and we also experienced a delay in transactions processed by the Depository Trust Company and banks and brokers in our transfer agent business. However, our ability to pivot and enhance our product offering with our virtual products generated increased revenue during the last three quarters of the year. Despite the short-term increase in revenue, the concentrations of our customer base within middle, small and micro-cap public customers make it reasonably possible that we are vulnerable to the risk of a near-term negative impact related to the COVID-19 outbreak if a substantial portion of these customers are forced to scale back or cease operations. We are closely monitoring the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on all aspects of our business and are unable at this time to predict the continued impact that COVID-19 will have on our business, financial position, and operating results in future periods due to numerous uncertainties.
Overall, the demand for our platforms and services continues to be stable in a majority of the segments we serve. We are seeing increased demand for virtual events using both our conference software and webcasting products, as customers are opting to hold virtual meetings. During the first and second quarter of 2020, we were able to pivot portions of our platform to specifically address COVID-19 business limitations. This resulted in a new Virtual Annual Meeting product, which combines our webcasting and proxy voting technology together. Additionally, we also upgraded technology of our conference software product to allow conferences to go entirely virtual and hold one-on-one meetings with audio, video and sharing features.
We believe these developments will assist us in delivering best of breed solutions to the market, but also lead us into new opportunities during this changing and challenging environment. The extent to how long these shifts in demands will occur is uncertain at this time and could be longer than just 2020 and the early part of 2021. However, we cannot make any assurances at this time that our product upgrades will be accepted by customers and revenue will be significant enough to offset losses in other aspects of our business in the long-term.
The transition to a platform subscription model has been and will continue to be key for our long-term sustainable growth. We will also continue to focus on the following key strategic initiatives during 2021:
●
Continue to expand our Communications products and adapt to this changing environment,
●
Continue to grow through acquisitions in areas of strategic focus,
●
Continue to expand our Communications sales and marketing teams and digital marketing strategy,
●
Continue to expand customer base,
●
Continue to expand our newswire distribution,
●
Invest in technology advancements and upgrades,
●
Generate profitable sustainable growth
●
Generate cash flows from operations.
We believe there is significant demand for our products around the world among the middle, small and micro-cap markets, as well as private companies, as they seek to find better platforms and tools to disseminate and communicate their messages. Although this demand may decrease or shift in the near term as a result of COVID-19, we believe we have the product sets, platforms, capacity and ability to adapt during these changing times to meet their requirements.
We have invested and will continue to invest in our product sets, platforms and intellectual property development via internal development and acquisitions. Acquisitions remain a core part of our strategy and we believe acquisitions are key to enhancing our overall offerings in the market and necessary to keep our competitive advantages and facilitate the next round of growth that management believes it can achieve. If we are successful in this effort, we believe we can further increase our market share and revenues per user as we move forward.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. Significant intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in consolidation.
Revenue Recognition
Substantially all the Company’s revenue comes from contracts with customers for subscriptions to its cloud-based products or contracts for communications and compliance products and services. Customers consist of corporate issuers and professional firms, such as investor relations and public relations firms. In the case of our news distribution and webcasting offerings, our customers also include private companies. The Company accounts for a contract with a customer when there is an enforceable contract between the Company and the customer, the rights of the parties are identified, the contract has economic substance, and collectability of the contract consideration is probable. The Company's revenues are measured based on consideration specified in the contract with each customer.
The Company's contracts include either a subscription to our entire platform or certain modules within our platform, or an agreement to perform services, or any combination thereof, and often contain multiple subscriptions and services. For these bundled contracts, the Company accounts for individual subscriptions and services as separate performance obligations if they are distinct, which is when a product or service is separately identifiable from other items in the bundled package, and a customer can benefit from it on its own or with other resources that are readily available to the customer. The Company separates revenue from its contracts into two revenue streams: i) Platform and Technology and ii) Services. Performance obligations of Platform and Technology contracts include providing subscriptions to certain modules or the entire Platform id. system, distributing press releases on a per release basis or conducting webcasts or virtual annual meetings on a per event basis. Performance obligations of Services contracts include obligations to deliver compliance services and annual report printing and distribution on either a stand ready obligation or on a per project or event basis. Set up fees for compliance services are considered a separate performance obligation and are satisfied upfront. Set up fees for our transfer agent module and investor relations content management module are immaterial. The Company’s subscription and service contracts are generally for one year, with automatic renewal clauses included in the contract until the contract is cancelled. The contracts do not contain any rights of returns, guarantees or warranties. Since contracts are generally for one year, all the revenue is expected to be recognized within one year from the contract start date. As such, the Company has elected the optional exemption that allows the Company not to disclose the transaction price allocated to performance obligations that are unsatisfied or partially satisfied at the end of each reporting period.
The Company recognizes revenue for subscriptions evenly over the contract period, upon distribution for per release contracts and upon event completion for webcasting and virtual annual meeting events. For service contracts that include stand ready obligations, revenue is recognized evenly over the contract period. For all other services delivered on a per project or event basis, the revenue is recognized at the completion of the event. The Company believes recognizing revenue for subscriptions and stand ready obligations using a time-based measure of progress, best reflects the Company’s performance in satisfying the obligations.
For bundled contracts, revenue is allocated to each performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price. Standalone selling prices are based on observable prices at which the Company separately sells the subscription or services. If a standalone selling price is not directly observable, the Company uses the residual method to allocate any remaining price to that subscription or service. The Company reviews standalone selling prices, at least annually, and updates these estimates if necessary.
Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts
The Company monitors outstanding receivables based on factors surrounding the credit risk of specific customers, historical trends, and other information. Credit is granted on an unsecured basis. The allowance for doubtful accounts is estimated based on an assessment of the Company’s ability to collect on customer accounts receivable. There is judgment involved with estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts and if the financial condition of the Company’s customers were to deteriorate, resulting in their inability to make the required payments, the Company may be required to record additional allowances or charges against revenues. Given the current environment of the COVID-19 pandemic additional attention has been paid to the financial viability of our customers. The Company generally writes-off accounts receivable against the allowance when it determines a balance is uncollectible and no longer actively pursues its collection.
Income Taxes
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are computed for differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities that will result in future taxable or deductible amounts based on enacted tax laws and rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. Valuation allowances are established, when necessary, to reduce deferred income tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized. For any uncertain tax positions, we recognize the impact of a tax position, only if it is more likely than not of being sustained upon examination, based on the technical merits of the position. Our policy regarding the classification of interest and penalties is to classify them as income tax expense in our financial statements, if applicable.
Capitalized Software
Costs incurred to develop our cloud-based platform products are capitalized when the preliminary project phase is complete, management commits to fund the project and it is probable the project will be completed and used for its intended purposes. Once the software is substantially complete and ready for its intended use, the software is amortized over its estimated useful life, which is typically four years. Costs related to design or maintenance of the software are expensed as incurred.
Impairment of Long-lived Assets
In accordance with the authoritative guidance for accounting for long-lived assets, assets such as property and equipment, trademarks, and intangible assets subject to amortization, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset group may not be recoverable. Recoverability of asset groups to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset group to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset group. If the carrying amount of an asset group exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of an asset group exceeds fair value of the asset group.
Lease Accounting
We determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Our operating lease agreements are primarily for office space and are included within lease right-of-use (“ROU”) assets and lease liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.
ROU assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. ROU assets and lease liabilities are recognized at the commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. Our variable lease payments consist of non-lease services related to the lease and payments under operating leases classified as short-term. Variable lease payments are excluded from the ROU assets and lease liabilities and are recognized in the period in which the obligation for those payments is incurred. As most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we use our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. ROU assets include any lease payments made and exclude lease incentives. Rental expense for lease payments related to operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.","ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.
We do not believe that we face material market risk with respect to our cash or cash equivalents, which totaled $19,556,000 and $15,766,000 at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.

Management’s Annual Report Regarding Internal Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act. Internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements for external purposes, in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The effectiveness of any system of internal control over financial reporting is subject to inherent limitations and therefore, may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness of future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate due to change in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
This annual report does not include an attestation report of the Company’s registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management’s report was not subject to attestation by the Company’s registered public accounting firm pursuant to rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission that permit the Company to provide only management’s report in this annual report.
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Based on an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (""Exchange Act"") were effective as of December 31, 2020, to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports that are filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Inherent Limitations over Internal Controls
Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and disposition of our assets; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, do not expect that our internal controls will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of internal controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. Also, any evaluation of the effectiveness of controls in future periods are subject to the risk that those internal controls may become inadequate because of changes in business conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Report of Management's Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended). Management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations (""COSO"") updated Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013). Based on this evaluation, management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2020.
There were no changes in our internal controls that could materially affect the disclosure controls and procedures subsequent to the date of their evaluation, nor were there any material deficiencies or material weaknesses in our internal controls. As a result, no corrective actions were required or undertaken.","ITEM 9B. OTHER INFORMATION.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Board of Directors and Stockholders Issuer Direct Corporation
Raleigh, North Carolina
Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Issuer Direct Corporation and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended December 31, 2020, and the related notes. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended December 31, 2020, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
Basis for Opinion
These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.
Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matters
The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that:
(1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.
Revenue from Contracts with Customers
The Company had $18,525,717 in revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020. As disclosed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s contracts include subscriptions to its cloud-based products or contracts for communications and compliance products and services. The Company’s contracts include either a subscription to the entire platform or certain modules within the platform or an agreement to perform services, or any combination thereof, and often contain multiple subscriptions and services.
Due to the nature of the Company’s contracts including multiple performance obligations, management exercises significant judgment in the following areas in determining appropriate revenue recognition:
●
Determination of which products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately or combined.
●
Determination of stand-alone selling prices for each performance obligation.
●
Estimation of contract transaction price and allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations.
●
The pattern of delivery for each distinct performance obligation.
●
Determination of which products and services are recognized over time or point in time.
As a result, a high degree of auditor judgment was required in performing audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of management’s judgments. Changes in these judgments can have a material effect on the amount of revenue recognized on these contracts.
Based on our knowledge of the Company, we determined the nature and extent of procedures to be performed over revenue, including the determination of the revenue streams over which those procedures were performed. Our audit procedures included the following for each revenue stream where procedures were performed:
●
Obtained an understanding of the internal controls and processes in place over the Company’s revenue recognition processes.
●
Analyzed the significant assumptions and estimates made by management as discussed above.
●
Selected a sample of revenue transactions and assessed the recorded revenue, analyzed the related contract, tested management’s identification of distinct performance obligations, compared the amounts recognized for consistency with underlying documentation, and tested certain controls identified for each revenue stream.

Note 1: Description, Background and Basis of Operations
Nature of Operations
Issuer Direct Corporation (the “Company” or “Issuer Direct”) was incorporated in the State of Delaware in October 1988 under the name Docucon Inc. Subsequent to the December 13, 2007 merger with My EDGAR, Inc., the Company changed its name to Issuer Direct Corporation. Today, Issuer Direct is an industry-leading global communications and compliance company focusing on the needs of corporate issuers. Issuer Direct's principal platform, Platform id.™, empowers users by thoughtfully integrating the most relevant tools, technologies and products, thus eliminating the complexity associated with producing and distributing their business communications and financial information. The Company operates under several brands in the market, including Direct Transfer, PrecisionIR (PIR), Investor Network, Interwest and ACCESSWIRE. The Company leverages its securities compliance and regulatory expertise to provide a comprehensive set of services that enhance a customer’s ability to communicate effectively with its shareholder base while meeting all reporting regulations required.
Note 2: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. Significant intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in consolidation.
Cash Equivalents
For purposes of the Company’s financial statements, the Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity date of three months or less to be cash equivalents.
Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts
The Company monitors outstanding receivables based on factors surrounding the credit risk of specific customers, historical trends, and other information. Credit is granted on an unsecured basis. The allowance for doubtful accounts is estimated based on an assessment of the Company’s ability to collect on customer accounts receivable. There is judgment involved with estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts and if the financial condition of the Company’s customers were to deteriorate, resulting in their inability to make the required payments, the Company may be required to record additional allowances or charges against revenues. Given the current environment of the COVID-19 pandemic additional attention has been paid to the financial viability of our customers. The Company generally writes-off accounts receivable against the allowance when it determines a balance is uncollectible and no longer actively pursues its collection.
The following is a summary of our allowance for doubtful accounts during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 (in 000’s):

Concentration of Credit Risk
Financial instruments and related items which potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash, cash equivalents and accounts receivables. The Company places its cash and temporary cash investments with credit quality institutions. Such cash balances are currently in excess of the FDIC insurance limit of $250,000. To reduce its risk associated with the failure of such financial institutions, each quarter the Company evaluates the rating of the financial institution in which it holds deposits. As of December 31, 2020, the total amount exceeding such limit was $18,397,000. The Company also had cash-on-hand of $45,000 in Europe and $441,000 in Canada as of December 31, 2020.
The Company believes it did not have any financial instruments that could have potentially subjected us to significant concentrations of credit risk for any relevant period.
Revenue Recognition
Substantially all the Company’s revenue comes from contracts with customers for subscriptions to its cloud-based products or contracts for communications and compliance products and services. Customers consist of corporate issuers and professional firms, such as investor relations and public relations firms. In the case of our news distribution and webcasting offerings, our customers also include private companies. The Company accounts for a contract with a customer when there is an enforceable contract between the Company and the customer, the rights of the parties are identified, the contract has economic substance, and collectability of the contract consideration is probable. The Company's revenues are measured based on consideration specified in the contract with each customer.
The Company's contracts include either a subscription to our entire platform or certain modules within our platform, or an agreement to perform services, or any combination thereof, and often contain multiple subscriptions and services. For these bundled contracts, the Company accounts for individual subscriptions and services as separate performance obligations if they are distinct, which is when a product or service is separately identifiable from other items in the bundled package, and a customer can benefit from it on its own or with other resources that are readily available to the customer. The Company separates revenue from its contracts into two revenue streams: i) Platform and Technology and ii) Services. Performance obligations of Platform and Technology contracts include providing subscriptions to certain modules or the entire Platform id. system, distributing press releases on a per release basis or conducting webcasts or virtual annual meetings on a per event basis. Performance obligations of Services contracts include obligations to deliver compliance services and annual report printing and distribution on either a stand ready obligation or on a per project or event basis. Set up fees for compliance services are considered a separate performance obligation and are satisfied upfront. Set up fees for our transfer agent module and investor relations content management module are immaterial. The Company’s subscription and service contracts are generally for one year, with automatic renewal clauses included in the contract until the contract is cancelled. The contracts do not contain any rights of returns, guarantees or warranties. Since contracts are generally for one year, all the revenue is expected to be recognized within one year from the contract start date. As such, the Company has elected the optional exemption that allows the Company not to disclose the transaction price allocated to performance obligations that are unsatisfied or partially satisfied at the end of each reporting period.
The Company recognizes revenue for subscriptions evenly over the contract period, upon distribution for per release contracts and upon event completion for webcasting and virtual annual meeting events. For service contracts that include stand ready obligations, revenue is recognized evenly over the contract period. For all other services delivered on a per project or event basis, the revenue is recognized at the completion of the event. The Company believes recognizing revenue for subscriptions and stand ready obligations using a time-based measure of progress, best reflects the Company’s performance in satisfying the obligations.
For bundled contracts, revenue is allocated to each performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price. Standalone selling prices are based on observable prices at which the Company separately sells the subscription or services. If a standalone selling price is not directly observable, the Company uses the residual method to allocate any remaining price to that subscription or service. The Company reviews standalone selling prices, at least annually, and updates these estimates if necessary.
The Company invoices its customers based on the billing schedules designated in its contracts, typically upfront on either a monthly, quarterly or annual basis or per transaction at the completion of the performance obligation. Deferred revenue for the periods presented was primarily related to subscription and service contracts, which are billed upfront, quarterly or annually, however the revenue has not yet been recognized. The associated deferred revenue is generally recognized ratably over the billing period. Additionally, deferred revenue is related to pre-paid packages of press releases for which the releases have not yet been disseminated. Deferred revenue as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 was $2,212,000 and $1,812,000, respectively, and is expected to be recognized within one year. Revenue recognized for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, that was included in the deferred revenue balance at the beginning of each reporting period, was approximately $1,812,000 and $1,249,000, respectively. Accounts receivable, net of allowance for doubtful accounts, related to contracts with customers was $2,514,000 and $2,051,000 as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. Since substantially all the contracts have terms of one year or less, the Company has elected to use the practical expedient regarding the existence of a significant financing.
Costs to obtain contracts with customers consist primarily of sales commissions. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company has capitalized $44,000 and $21,000, respectively, of costs to obtain contracts that are expected to be amortized over more than one year. For contract costs expected to be amortized in less than one year, the Company has elected to use the practical expedient allowing the recognition of incremental costs of obtaining a contract as an expense when incurred. The Company has considered historical renewal rates, expectations of future renewals and economic factors in making these determinations.
Fixed Assets
Fixed assets are recorded at cost and depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the assets using principally the straight-line method. When items are retired or otherwise disposed of, income is charged or credited for the difference between net book value and proceeds realized thereon. Ordinary maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred, and replacements and betterments are capitalized. The range of estimated useful lives used to calculate depreciation for principal items of property and equipment are as follow:
Asset Category
Depreciation / Amortization Period
Computer equipment
years
Furniture & equipment
3 to 7 years
Leasehold improvements
8 years or lesser of the lease term
Earnings per Share
Earnings per share accounting guidance requires that basic net income per common share be computed by dividing net income for the period by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net income per share is computed by dividing the net income for the period by the weighted average number of common and dilutive common equivalent shares outstanding during the period. Shares issuable upon the exercise of stock options totaling 40,000 and 93,000 were excluded in the computation of diluted earnings per common share during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, because their impact was anti-dilutive.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Significant estimates include the allowance for doubtful accounts and the valuation of goodwill, intangible assets, deferred tax assets, and stock-based compensation. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Gain on Extinguishment of Debt
On October 2, 2017, the Company entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (the “Interwest Purchase Agreement’) to purchase all of the outstanding equity securities of Interwest Transfer Company, Inc., a Utah corporation (“Interwest”) a transfer agent business located in Salt Lake City, Utah. Under the terms of the Interwest Purchase Agreement the Company paid $1,935,000 at closing, $288,000 on the first anniversary of the closing, $320,000 on the second anniversary of the closing and called for another $320,000 to be paid upon the third anniversary date of the closing. The Company also issued 25,235 shares of restricted common stock of the Company at closing. Upon final negotiation and settlement of the third anniversary payment, the Company paid $240,000 to the seller. The difference of $80,000 that was not paid is recorded as Gain on Extinguishment of Debt on the Consolidated Statements of Income for the year ended December 31, 2020.
Income Taxes
We comply with Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) No. 740 - Income Taxes which requires an asset and liability approach to financial accounting and reporting for income taxes. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are computed for differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities that will result in future taxable or deductible amounts based on enacted tax laws and rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. Valuation allowances are established, when necessary, to reduce deferred income tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized. For any uncertain tax positions, we recognize the impact of a tax position, only if it is more likely than not of being sustained upon examination, based on the technical merits of the position. Our policy regarding the classification of interest and penalties is to classify them as income tax expense in our financial statements, if applicable.
Capitalized Software
Costs incurred to develop our cloud-based platform products are capitalized when the preliminary project phase is complete, management commits to fund the project and it is probable the project will be completed and used for its intended purposes. Once the software is substantially complete and ready for its intended use, the software is amortized over its estimated useful life, which is typically four years. Costs related to design or maintenance of the software are expensed as incurred. The Company did not capitalize any costs for software development during the year ended December 31, 2020 and capitalized $20,000 during the year ended December 31, 2019. The Company recorded amortization expense of $608,000 and $843,000 during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, $599,000 and $783,000 of which is included in Cost of revenues on the Consolidated Statements of Income. The remaining amount of $9,000 and $60,000 for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, is included in Depreciation and amortization.
The Company reviews capitalized software for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. One part of the Company’s suite of products was directed toward private companies seeking to raise capital under Regulation A+ and Regulation D. Market acceptance under these regulations is behind what was initially anticipated, resulting in lower-than-expected revenue from this product. As a result, the Company wrote-off the remaining carrying value of this product in the amount of $44,000 as of December 31, 2019. This amount is included in Depreciation and amortization expense on the Consolidated Statements of Income for the year ended December 31, 2019.
Impairment of Long-lived Assets
In accordance with the authoritative guidance for accounting for long-lived assets, assets such as property and equipment, trademarks, and intangible assets subject to amortization, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset group may not be recoverable. Recoverability of asset groups to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset group to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset group. If the carrying amount of an asset group exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of an asset group exceeds fair value of the asset group.
Lease Accounting
We determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Our operating lease agreements are primarily for office space and are included within lease right-of-use (“ROU”) assets and lease liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.
ROU assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. ROU assets and lease liabilities are recognized at the commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. Our variable lease payments consist of non-lease services related to the lease and payments under operating leases classified as short-term. Variable lease payments are excluded from the ROU assets and lease liabilities and are recognized in the period in which the obligation for those payments is incurred. As most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we use our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. ROU assets include any lease payments made and exclude lease incentives. Rental expense for lease payments related to operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Fair Value Measurements
ASC Topic 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy that requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. Assets and liabilities recorded at fair value in the financial statements are categorized based upon the hierarchy of levels of judgment associated with the inputs used to measure their fair value. Hierarchical levels directly related to the amount of subjectivity associated with the inputs to fair valuation of these assets and liabilities, are as follows:
●
Level 1 - Quoted prices are available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the reporting date. Generally, this includes debt and equity securities that are traded in an active market. Our cash and cash equivalents are quoted at Level 1.
●
Level 2 - Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. Generally, this includes debt and equity securities that are not traded in an active market.
●
Level 3 - Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities. Level 3 assets and liabilities include financial instruments whose value is determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies, or other valuation techniques, as well as instruments for which the determination of fair value requires significant management judgment or estimation.
As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we believe that the fair value of our financial instruments other than cash and cash equivalents, such as, accounts receivable, our line of credit, notes payable, and accounts payable approximate their carrying amounts.
Stock-based Compensation
The authoritative guidance for stock compensation requires that companies estimate the fair value of share-based payment awards on the date of the grant using an option-pricing model. The associated cost is recognized over the period during which an employee or director is required to provide service in exchange for the award.
Translation of Foreign Financial Statements
The financial statements of the foreign subsidiaries of the Company have been translated into U.S. dollars. All assets and liabilities have been translated at current rates of exchange in effect at the end of the period. Income and expense items have been translated at the average exchange rates for the year or the applicable interim period. The gains or losses that result from this process are recorded as a separate component of other accumulated comprehensive income until the entity is sold or substantially liquidated.
Comprehensive Income
Comprehensive income consists of net income and other comprehensive income related to changes in the cumulative foreign currency translation adjustment.
Business Combinations, Goodwill and Intangible Assets
We account for business combinations under FASB ASC No. 805 - Business Combinations and the related acquired intangible assets and goodwill under FASB ASC No. 350 - Intangibles - Goodwill and Other. The authoritative guidance for business combinations specifies the criteria for recognizing and reporting intangible assets apart from goodwill. We record the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations at their respective fair values at the date of acquisition, with any excess purchase price recorded as goodwill. Goodwill is an asset representing the future economic benefits arising from other assets acquired in a business combination that are not individually identified and separately recognized. Intangible assets consist of client relationships, customer lists, distribution partner relationships, software, technology, non-compete agreements and trademarks that are initially measured at fair value. At the time of the business combination, trademarks are considered an indefinite-lived asset and, as such, are not amortized as there is no foreseeable limit to cash flows generated from them. The goodwill and intangible assets are assessed annually for impairment, or whenever conditions indicate the asset may be impaired, and any such impairment will be recognized in the period identified. The client relationships (7-10 years), customer lists (3 years), distribution partner relationships (10 years), non-compete agreements (5 years) and software and technology (3-6 years) are amortized over their estimated useful lives (See Note 4).
Advertising
The Company expenses advertising as incurred. Advertising expense totaled $245,000 and $163,000, during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Recently adopted accounting pronouncements
On January 1, 2020, the Company adopted Accounting Standard Update (“ASU”) 2017-04 Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment. These amendments eliminate Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test. The annual, or interim, goodwill impairment test is performed by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. An impairment charge should be recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value; however, the loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. In addition, income tax effects from any tax-deductible goodwill on the carrying amount of the reporting unit should be considered when measuring the goodwill impairment loss, if applicable. The amendments also eliminate the requirements for any reporting unit with a zero or negative carrying amount to perform a qualitative assessment and, if it fails that qualitative test, to perform Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test. An entity still has the option to perform the qualitative assessment for a reporting unit to determine if the quantitative impairment test is necessary. The Company adopted this amendment as of January 1, 2020 and it has not, nor is it expected to have a significant impact to the financial statements.

During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company disposed of fixed assets totaling $377,000.
Note 4: Recent Acquisitions
Acquisition of the VisualWebcaster Platform (“VWP”)
On January 3, 2019 (the “Closing Date”), the Company entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the “VWP Agreement”) with Onstream Media Corporation, a Florida corporation (the “Seller”), whereby the Company purchased certain assets related primarily to customer accounts, intellectual property, lease deposits and assumed certain existing contractual obligations related primarily to data processing and storage, bandwidth and facility leases relating to the Seller’s VisualWebcaster Platform. The accounts receivable and the accounts payable related to VWP and existing as of the Closing Date were not included as part of the VWP Agreement.
The acquisition was accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations in accordance with FASB ASC 805, Business Combinations, which requires, among other things, that the assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recognized at their fair values as of the acquisition date. Acquisition-related costs, which totaled approximately $155,000, are not included as a component of the acquisition accounting, but are recognized as expenses in the periods in which the costs are incurred. The Company employed a third-party valuation firm to assist in determining the purchase price allocation of assets and liabilities acquired from Seller. The valuation resulted in the tangible and intangible assets and liabilities disclosed below. The income approach was used to determine the value of the customer relationships and non-compete agreement. The income approach determines the fair value for the asset based on the present value of cash flows projected to be generated by the asset. Projected cash flows are discounted at a rate of return that reflects the relative risk of achieving the cash flow and the time value of money. Projected cash flows considered multiple factors, including current revenue from existing customers; analysis of expected revenue and attrition trends; reasonable contract renewal assumptions from the perspective of a marketplace participant; probability of executives competing, expected profit margins giving consideration to marketplace synergies; and required returns to contributory assets. The relief from royalty method was used to value the technology. The relief from royalty method determines the fair value by calculating what a typical license fee would be in order to obtain the same or similar license of the technology from market participants. Projected cash flows consider revenue assumptions allocated to the technology.
The transaction consisted of a single cash payment to the Seller in the amount of $2,788,000. In connection with the acquisition, the Company assumed two short-term leases associated with an office and co-location for certain computer equipment in New York City, New York as well as entered into a three-year office lease in Florida. In addition to the intangible assets listed below, the purchase price included lease deposits of $13,000 and a right of use asset and corresponding lease liability for the office lease in Florida in the amount of $125,000.
The identified intangible assets as a result of the acquisition are as follows (in 000’s):

During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company granted 18,000 restricted stock units with an intrinsic value of $10.67, to certain members of the Board of Directors of the Company. The vesting period for the restricted stock units is the earlier of the 2021 annual meeting of shareholders or one year depending on whether a director stands for re-election at the 2021 annual meeting. During the year ended December 31, 2020, 32,000 restricted stock units with an intrinsic value of $11.61 vested. As of December 31, 2020, there was $91,000 of unrecognized compensation cost related to our unvested restricted stock units, which will be recognized through 2021. All restricted stock units have been registered with the SEC.
During the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we recorded compensation expense of $273,000 and $523,000, respectively, related to stock options and restricted stock units.
Note 9: Leases
Generally, our leasing activity consists of office leases. In March 2019, we signed a new lease to move our corporate headquarters to Raleigh, North Carolina. As we continue our transition from a services-based company to a cloud-based platform company, the new lease affords us the ability to separate our warehouse from our corporate office. The new lease, which had a lease commencement date of October 2, 2019, is for 9,766 square feet and expires December 31, 2027. Minimum lease payments are $2,997,000, not including a tenant improvement allowance of $488,000, which is included in fixed assets as of December 31, 2020. We recognized a ROU asset and corresponding lease liability of $2,596,000, which represents the present value of minimum lease payments discounted at 3.77%, the Company’s incremental borrowing rate at lease inception.
Additionally, we have an office in Salt Lake City, Utah, which is on a short-term lease that is less than twelve months. As a result, we have elected the short-term lease recognition exemption for our Utah office lease, which means, for those leases we do not expect to extend beyond twelve months, we will not recognize ROU assets or lease liabilities.
In connection with the Company’s acquisition of VWP (See Note 4), the Company assumed two short-term leases in New York City, NY and entered into a three-year office lease in Florida. We have elected the short-term lease exemption for the two New York leases because we do not expect them to extend beyond twelve months. For the Florida lease, which was signed on January 4, 2019, we recognized a ROU asset and corresponding lease liability of $125,000, which represents the present value of minimum lease payments discounted at 4.25%, the Company’s incremental borrowing rate at lease inception. After year-end, the Company vacated one of the leases in New York.
Lease liabilities totaled $2,361,000 as of December 31, 2020. The current portion of this liability of $390,000 is included in Accrued expenses on the Consolidated balance sheets and the long-term portion of $1,971,000 is included in Lease liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Rent expense consists of both operating lease expense from amortization of our ROU assets as well as variable lease expense which consists of non-lease components of office leases (i.e. common area maintenance) or rent expense associated with short- term leases. The components of lease expense were as follows (in 000’s):
Year ended
December 31,
Year ended
December 31,
Lease expense
Operating lease expense
$347
$241
Variable lease expense
Rent expense
$479
$374
The weighted-average remaining non-cancelable lease term for our operating leases was 6.9 years as of December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2020, the weighted-average discount rate used to determine the lease liability was 3.8%. The future minimum lease payments to be made under non-cancelable operating leases on December 31, 2020, are as follows (in 000’s):
Year Ended December 31:
$394
Thereafter
Total lease payments
$2,702

We have performed an evaluation of our other contracts with customers and suppliers in accordance with Topic 842 and have determined that, except for the leases described above, none of our contracts contain a lease.
Note 10: Commitments and Contingencies
From time to time, the Company may be involved in litigation that arises through the normal course of business. The Company is neither a party to any litigation nor are we aware of any such threatened or pending litigation that might result in a material adverse effect to our business.
Note 11: Revenues
We consider ourselves to be in a single reportable segment under the authoritative guidance for segment reporting, specifically a shareholder communications and compliance company for publicly traded and private companies. The following tables present revenue disaggregated by revenue stream in (000’s):

As of each reporting date, the Company’s management considers new evidence, both positive and negative, that could impact management’s view with regard to future realization of deferred tax assets. In assessing the recovery of the deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income in the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversals of future deferred tax assets, projected future taxable income, and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. It has been determined that is more likely than not that the Company's deferred tax assets are able to be realized based on future positive earnings and reversal of existing temporary differences.
The Company had no unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2020 or December 31, 2019. Interest and, if applicable, penalties are recognized related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. There are no accruals for interest and penalties on December 31, 2020.
Undistributed earnings of the Company are insignificant as of December 31, 2020. With the enactment of the 2017 Act, the Company does not consider any of its foreign earnings as indefinitely reinvested.
The Company is subject to income taxation by both federal and state taxing authorities. Income tax returns for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 are open to audit by federal and state taxing authorities.
Note 13: Employee Benefit Plans
The Company sponsors a defined contribution 401(k) Profit Sharing Plan and allows all employees in the United States to participate. Matching and profit-sharing contributions to the plan are at the discretion of management, but are limited to the amount deductible for federal income tax purposes. The Company made contributions to the plan of $24,000 and $27,000 during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.",3

Elastic is a search company.
Search is foundational to a wide variety of experiences. Elastic makes the power of search-the ability to instantly find relevant information and insights from large amounts of data-available for a diverse set of applications and solutions, including Enterprise Search, Observability, and Security.
Elastic powers the search behind a ride sharing app to help locate nearby riders and drivers. Elastic powers the search for finding the right products to add to your cart for an ecommerce application. Elastic powers the search for a digital creative software company, enabling users to search across millions of digital assets to find the right photo, font, or color palette to complete a creative project. Elastic powers the logging of billions of events per day to track and manage website performance issues and network outages of a telecommunications company with nationwide networks of mobile subscribers. Elastic powers the processing of terabytes of daily data in real time to monitor the usage of thousands of servers for a financial services company across their entire IT environments. Elastic powers a university’s cybersecurity operations to protect thousands of devices and critical data. All of this is search.
Why we search remains constant: we’re looking for insight, information, and answers. But how and what we search changes over time, from the Dewey Decimal System for libraries to Google for the World Wide Web to conversations with virtual assistants for everyday inquiries. Today, what we search has grown to include a rapidly increasing amount of structured and unstructured data from a multitude of sources such as databases, websites, applications, and mobile and connected devices. While search experiences often begin with search boxes, they are not confined to them. Dragging your finger across a map on a smartphone screen is search. Zooming into a specific time frame in a histogram is search. Mining log files for errors is search. Forecasting storage capacity two weeks into the future is search. Using natural language processing to analyze user sentiment is search.
Elastic created the Elastic Stack, a powerful set of software products that ingest and store data from any source, and in any format, and perform search, analysis, and visualization in milliseconds or less. Developers build on top of the Elastic Stack to apply the power of search to their data and solve business problems. We have also built software solutions on the Elastic Stack that address a wide variety of use cases: Elastic Enterprise Search for workplace search, app search and site search, Elastic Observability for logging, metrics and application performance management (“APM”), and Elastic Security for security information and event management (“SIEM”) and endpoint security.
The Elastic Stack and our solutions are designed to run in public or private clouds, in hybrid environments, or in traditional on-premises environments. As the technology landscape shifts, our products grow and adapt. In that sense, we believe that our company is truly elastic.
Our origins are rooted in open source, which facilitates rapid adoption of our software and enables efficient distribution of our technology. Developers can either download or deploy our software directly in the cloud as a managed offering on our website, for use in development and production environments. Our offerings include both free and paid products and solutions.
Our business model is based on a combination of free and paid proprietary software. For self-managed users who download our products, we make some of the proprietary features of our software available for free. Other proprietary features are only available through paid subscriptions, which also include access to support on all free and paid features. We also provide our software as a service (“SaaS”). There is no free subscription tier in our SaaS offerings. Unlike some open source companies, we do not build a separate enterprise version of an original open source project. Instead, we develop and test one robust codebase, over which we maintain control. We believe that maintaining full control over the source code enables us to develop better products for our users and customers. Our sales and marketing efforts start with developers and other users who have already adopted our software and then evolve to departmental decision-makers and senior executives who have broad purchasing power in their organizations. All of these actions help us build a powerful commercial business model.
Our customers often significantly expand their usage of our products over time. Expansion includes increasing the number of developers using our products, increasing the utilization of our products for a particular use case, and applying our products to new use cases. We focus some of our direct sales efforts on encouraging these types of expansion within our customer base.
Our business has experienced rapid growth around the world. As of April 30, 2021, we had over 15,000 customers compared to over 11,300 customers and over 8,100 customers as of April 30, 2020 and April 30, 2019, respectively. Our revenue was $608.5 million in the year ended April 30, 2021, $427.6 million in the year ended April 30, 2020, and $271.7 million in the year ended April 30, 2019, representing year-over-year growth of 42% and 57% for the years ended April 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Subscriptions accounted for 93%, 92% and 91% of our total revenue in the years ended
April 30, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Revenue from outside the United States accounted for 45%, 43% and 43% of our total revenue in the years ended April 30, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
In the years ended April 30, 2021, 2020 and 2019, we incurred net losses of $129.4 million, $167.2 million and $102.3 million, respectively. For the year ended April 30, 2021, our cash provided by operating activities was $22.5 million, and for the years ended April 30, 2020 and 2019, our cash used in operating activities was $30.6 million and $23.9 million, respectively. We expect we will continue to incur net losses for the foreseeable future.
Our Products
We founded Elastic to bring the power of search to a broad range of business and consumer use cases. Our products enable our users and customers to instantly find relevant information and insights in large amounts of data.
We offer the Elastic Stack, a powerful set of software products that ingest and store data from any source, in any format, and perform search, analysis, and visualization, usually in milliseconds. The Elastic Stack can be used by developers to power a variety of use cases. We also offer software solutions built in the Elastic Stack that address a wide variety of use cases. The Elastic Stack and our solutions are designed to run in public or private clouds, in hybrid environments, or in traditional on-premises environments.
The Elastic Stack
The Elastic Stack is primarily composed of the following products:
•Elasticsearch. Elasticsearch is the heart of the Elastic Stack. It is a distributed, real-time search and analytics engine and datastore for all types of data, including textual, numerical, geospatial, structured, and unstructured.
•Kibana. Kibana is the user interface for the Elastic Stack. It is the visualization layer for data stored in Elasticsearch. It is also the management and configuration interface for all parts of the Elastic Stack.
The Elastic Stack also supports data ingest with a number of supporting products:
•Logstash. Logstash is the dynamic data processing pipeline for ingesting data into Elasticsearch or other storage systems from a multitude of sources simultaneously.
•Beats. Beats is the family of lightweight, single-purpose data shippers for sending data from edge machines to Elasticsearch or Logstash.
•Elastic Agent. Elastic Agent, currently in beta, is a single, unified way to add monitoring for logs, metrics, and other types of data to each host. Elastic Agent includes integrated host protection and central management.
Some features of the Elastic Stack are free and open, available to users at no cost, while others require paid subscriptions. Paid proprietary features enable capabilities such as automating anomaly detection on time series data at scale through machine learning, facilitating compliance with data security and privacy regulations, supporting search across low cost cold and frozen data tiers, and allowing real-time notifications and alerts. The source code of both free and paid features in the Elastic Stack is visible to the public in the form of “open code.”
Our Solutions
We have built a number of solutions on top of the Elastic Stack to make it easier for organizations to use our software for common use cases. Like the Elastic Stack, our solutions comprise a combination of free and open features, and paid proprietary features. Our solutions include:
•Enterprise Search. Our Enterprise Search solution provides powerful search for documents and results living in websites, applications and workplaces. Enterprise Search includes: Workplace Search, a unified search platform for the workplace that seamlessly connects to the most widely used enterprise systems and tools; App Search, a flexible, API-driven tool for building search experiences to support websites and portals, e-commerce, mobile app search, and customer support; and Site Search, an easy way to bring powerful search to any website.
•Observability. Our Observability solution enables unified analysis across the IT ecosystem of applications, networks, and infrastructure.

operations, shareable analytics, incident management, and investigations; and Endpoint Security, for prevention, detection and response in a single, stack-integrated agent.
Our Deployment Options
The Elastic Stack and our solutions generally can be deployed in public or private clouds, in hybrid environments, or in traditional on-premises environments, to satisfy various user and customer needs.
•Self-Managed. Today, most users manage their own deployments of the Elastic Stack and our solutions. To help with more complex deployment scenarios, we offer Elastic Cloud Enterprise and Elastic Cloud on Kubernetes, paid proprietary products, to deliver centralized provisioning, management, and monitoring across multiple deployments.
•SaaS. Many customers are becoming increasingly interested in SaaS deployment alternatives that reduce the burden of administration. For these customers we have developed a family of SaaS products called Elastic Cloud, which includes Elasticsearch Service and Site Search Service. We host and manage our Elastic Cloud products on infrastructure from multiple public cloud providers.
Our Business Model
Our business model refers to how we make our software available, including our free and open distribution and go-to-market strategy, and how we charge our customers. We believe our business model creates significant value for our users, our customers, and our company.
Our business model is based on a combination of free and paid proprietary software. We market and distribute the Elastic Stack and our solutions using a free and open distribution strategy. Developers and other users are able to download our software directly from our website. Some features of our software can be used free of charge. Others are only available through paid subscriptions, which include access to proprietary features and support. These paid features can be unlocked with a simple license update, without the need to re-deploy the software. We also provide our software as a service, as part of Elastic Cloud. There is no free subscription tier in our Elastic Cloud offerings. The rate at which our customers purchase additional subscriptions and expand the value of existing subscriptions depends on a number of factors, including customers’ level of satisfaction with our products, the nature and size of the deployments, the desire to address additional use cases, and the perceived need for additional proprietary features. The source code of all Elastic Stack features is visible to the public in the form of “open code.”
Our distribution model facilitates rapid and efficient adoption, particularly by empowering individual developers and other users to download and use our software without payment, registration, or the friction of a formal sales interaction. It also fosters a vibrant developer community around our products and solutions, which drives adoption of our products and increased interaction among users. Further, this approach enables community review of our code and products, which allows us to improve the reliability and security of our software. We believe that the number of times our products have been downloaded and the size of our developer community are indicative of the benefits of our free and open strategy and the growth in adoption of our products. However, we generally do not have visibility into, and cannot accurately determine how often, our downloaded products are being actively used.
We have designed our strategy to avoid some of the risks associated with an open source model. One such risk relates to control over the direction and roadmap of our products. We maintain full control over the source code of our products and solutions. While community members may suggest changes to our products, only Elastic employees are able to commit changes to the codebase. Also, many of our free features have been historically distributed under a proprietary license. In February 2021, with the release of version 7.11 of the Elastic Stack, we changed the source code of Elasticsearch and Kibana that had previously been licensed under an open source license to be licensed under a proprietary license. Further, unlike some open source companies, we do not build a separate enterprise edition of an original open source project. Instead, we develop, maintain, and test a single robust codebase that is shared by our entire developer community.
Some open source companies sell only support for software that they make available at no cost. We believe this can create misaligned incentives in that the support vendor benefits from low software quality. Accordingly, we focus on designing high-quality software products that include proprietary features and are easy to use and reliable. We include support only as part of our subscriptions.
We believe in building products that provide value and appeal to the people who use them, including developers, architects, DevOps personnel, IT professionals, and security analysts. At the same time, a software company should be able to engage and build relationships with departmental or organizational leaders who make large technology purchasing decisions. At Elastic, we do both.
Strengths of Our Products
The strengths of our products include the following:
•Speed. The Elastic Stack can find matches for search criteria in milliseconds within even the largest structured and unstructured datasets. Its schema-less structure and inverted indices enable real-time search of high volumes of structured, unstructured, and time series data.
•Scale. The Elastic Stack is a distributed system and can scale massively. It has the ability to subdivide search indices into multiple pieces called shards, which enables data volume to be scaled horizontally and operations to be distributed across hundreds of systems or more. A developer running hundreds of nodes has the same user experience as a developer running a single node on a laptop.
•Relevance. Elasticsearch uses multiple analytical techniques to determine the similarity between stored data and queries, generating highly relevant results reflecting a deep understanding of text and context. Its sophisticated yet developer-friendly query language permits advanced search and analytics. Additionally, the speed of the Elastic Stack permits query iteration, further enhancing the relevance of search results.
•Ease of Use. The Elastic Stack is engineered to take a user from data to dashboard or inquiry to insight in minutes. It offers an easy getting started experience, featuring streamlined download and deployment, sensible defaults, a simple and intuitive query language that just works, and no need to define a schema up front. Administrative tasks such as securing the Elastic Stack are intuitive and integrated into the user experience, as are investigative tasks such as data visualization.
•Flexibility. The Elastic Stack is able to ingest, filter, store, search, and analyze data in any form, whether structured or unstructured. These capabilities enable the Elastic Stack to generate insights from a wide variety of data sources for a range of use cases. The flexibility of the Elastic Stack also enables users to begin using our products along with their existing systems, which lowers barriers to adoption.
•Extensibility. Developers can use the Elastic Stack as a foundation for addressing a wide variety of use cases. Our open approach to building the Elastic Stack empowers developers to innovate and utilize it to fit their specific needs. Additionally, our developer community actively engages with us to improve and expand the Elastic Stack.
Our Growth Strategies
We intend to pursue the following growth strategies:
•Increase product adoption by improving ease of use and growing our user community. With our engineering efforts focused on the user experience, we will continue to develop software that makes our products easier to use and adopt for both developers and non-developers. We will continue to engage with developers globally through a wide range of touch points such as community meetups, global community groups, hackathons, our global events, which we call ElasticON, and engagement on our website, user forums, and code repositories, to grow our user community.
•Expand our customer base by acquiring new customers. Through our distribution model, self-managed users can easily download our software directly from our website and access many features free of charge, which facilitates rapid adoption. Through Elastic Cloud, our SaaS offering, we provide the fastest and easiest way to get started with a free trial. However, there is no free subscription tier in Elastic Cloud. Our sales and marketing team conducts campaigns to drive further awareness and adoption within the user community. As a result, many of our sales prospects are already familiar with our technology prior to entering into a commercial relationship with us. Additionally, we leverage our network of partners to drive awareness and expand our sales and marketing reach to target new customers. We will continue to engage our community and our partners to drive awareness and to invest in our sales and marketing team to grow our customer base.
•Expand within our existing customer base through new use cases and larger deployments. We often enter an organization through a single developer or a small team for an initial project or use case with an objective to quickly solve a technical challenge or business problem. Because of the rapid success with our products, knowledge of Elastic often spreads within an organization to new teams of developers, architects, IT operations personnel, security personnel, and senior executives. We will continue to invest in helping users and customers be successful with our products, and we view initial success with our products as a path to drive expansion to new use cases and projects and larger deployments within organizations.
•Extend our product leadership through continued investment in our technology. We will continue to invest in our self-managed and SaaS products to extend into new use cases, industries, geographies, and customers.
•Increase usage of Elastic Cloud. We believe that providing our SaaS products represents a significant growth opportunity. We plan to expand Elastic Cloud geographically and through more public cloud providers. We plan to continue to invest resources in increasing the adoption of Elastic Cloud.
•Expand our strategic and regional partnerships. Our partners assist us in driving awareness of Elastic and our products, building new solutions on top of the Elastic Stack to solve customer pain points, and extending our reach in geographic areas and verticals where we do not have a formal sales presence. We have a diverse range of partners and we will continue to pursue partnerships to further the development of the Elastic Stack and our customer reach.
•Selectively pursue acquisitions and strategic investments. We have selectively pursued acquisitions and strategic investments in businesses and technologies in order to drive product and market expansion. Since inception, we have acquired technology underlying our security offerings (formerly Endgame), Site Search and App Search offerings (formerly Swiftype), our APM offering (formerly Opbeat), our machine learning feature (formerly Prelert), our Beats product (formerly Packetbeat), our Elastic Cloud SaaS offering (formerly Found) and our Kibana and Logstash products through strategic transactions. We intend to continue to pursue acquisitions and strategic investments selectively.
Customers
Organizations of all sizes, across many industries, both private and public, purchase our products for a variety of use cases. As of April 30, 2021, we had over 15,000 customers. No customer represented more than 10% of our total revenue in the year ended April 30, 2021.
Engineering
Our engineering organization focuses on enhancing existing products and developing new products, both open source and proprietary, that are easy to use and can be run in any environment including in public or private clouds, in hybrid environments, or in traditional on-premises environments. With a distributed engineering team spanning over 30 countries, we are able to recruit, hire, and retain high-quality, experienced developers, tech leads, and product managers, and operate at a rapid pace to drive product releases, fix bugs, and create new product offerings.
Our software development process is based on iterative releases across the Elastic Stack, our solutions, and Elastic Cloud. We are organized in small functional teams with a high degree of autonomy and accountability. Our distributed and highly modular team structure and well-defined software development processes also allow us to successfully incorporate technologies that we have acquired.
We intend to continue to invest in our research and development capabilities to extend our products. Research and development expense totaled $199.2 million and $165.4 million, in the years ended April 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. We plan to continue to devote significant resources to research and development.
Sales and Marketing
We make it easy for individual developers to begin using our products in order to drive viral adoption. Users can download our software directly from our website without any sales interaction, and immediately begin using the full set of free and paid features. Access to our paid features is available for an initial trial period for both self-managed and SaaS subscriptions.
As a result of our free and open strategy, our sales prospects are often already using our technology. Our sales and marketing efforts extend our free and open strategy in two key ways. First, we conduct low-touch marketing campaigns to keep users and customers engaged after they download our software. This includes providing high-quality content, documentation, webinars, videos, and blogs through our website. Second, we conduct high-touch virtual and field campaigns with qualified prospects and customers who have typically already deployed our software to drive further awareness, adoption, and expansion of our products and solutions.
Our sales teams are segmented primarily by geography and secondarily by employee count in relation to our prospects and customers. We rely on inside sales development representatives to qualify leads based on their likelihood to make a purchase. We pursue sales opportunities primarily through a direct sales motion, in some cases assisted by partners. Our relationships within customer organizations often extend beyond the initial users of the technology and include technology and business decision-makers at various levels. We also engage with our customers on an ongoing basis through a customer success team, to ensure customer satisfaction and expand their usage of our technology.
Partners
We maintain partner relationships that help us market and deliver our products to our customers and complement our community. Our partner relationships include the following:
•Cloud providers. We work with many of the major cloud providers to increase awareness of our products and make it easy to access our software. We partner with Google and Microsoft to offer our Elasticsearch Service (part of Elastic Cloud) on Google Cloud Platform (“GCP”), and Microsoft Azure, respectively, including direct purchase from us and through their respective marketplaces. We also partner with other cloud providers to provide our free and paid proprietary features to users on their cloud platforms. In addition, we make our Elasticsearch Service available on Amazon Web Services (“AWS”), for direct purchase or through the AWS marketplace. Elastic’s Elasticsearch Service is a different offering than Amazon Elasticsearch Service. We do not partner with Amazon, provide support for Amazon Elasticsearch Service, or provide Amazon or customers of Amazon Elasticsearch Service with access to any of our free or paid proprietary features.
•Systems integrators, channel partners, and referral partners. We have a global network of systems integrators, channel partners, and referral partner relationships that help deliver our products to various business and government customers around the world.
•OEM and MSP partners. Our original equipment manufacturing (“OEM”), and managed service provider (“MSP”), partners embed an Elastic subscription into the products or services they offer to their own customers. OEM or MSP partners are able to include Elastic’s paid and unpaid proprietary features in their product, receive ongoing support from Elastic for product development, and receive support for end customer issues related to Elastic.
•Technology partners. Our technology partners collaborate with Elastic to create a standardized solution for end users that includes technology from both Elastic and the partner. For example, we work with Micro Focus to integrate our products with their ArcSight product. Technology partners represent a deeper collaboration than community contributions and are distinct from distribution-oriented relationships like OEMs and MSP partners.
Professional Services
We offer consulting and training as part of our offerings. To assist customers in accelerating their success with our software, our consulting team consists of engineers and architects who bring hands-on experience and deep technical knowledge to a project. Our training offerings enable our users to gain the necessary skills to develop, deploy, and manage our software.
Customer Support
We endeavor to make it easy for users to download, install, deploy and use the Elastic Stack and our solutions. To this end, our user community functions as a source of support and enables users to engage in self-help and collaboration.
However, in many situations, such as those involving complex enterprise IT environments, large deployments and novel use cases, our users require our support. Accordingly, we include support as part of the subscriptions we sell for our products. Our global support organization consists of highly technical support engineers who provide support experiences including troubleshooting, technical audits, cluster tuning, and upgrade assistance. Our support team is distributed across over 20 countries and provides coverage 24 hours per day, 365 days per year, across multiple languages.
We believe that software companies should not have incentives to build low quality software. In that connection, we do not sell support separately from our software subscriptions.
Our Technology
Our products consist of the Elastic Stack, our solutions and software that supports our various deployment alternatives. Because our solutions are built on the Elastic Stack, innovations and new capabilities built into the Elastic Stack may benefit many of our solutions. Our customers can customize and extend our solutions to fit their needs by leveraging the power of the Elastic Stack and our developer capabilities.
Technology Features of the Elastic Stack
Elasticsearch is the heart of the Elastic Stack, where users store, search, and analyze data. Key features of Elasticsearch include the following:
•Store any type of data. Elasticsearch combines powerful parts of traditional search engines, such as an inverted index to power fast full text search and a column store for analytics, with native support for a wide range of data types, including text, dates, numbers, geospatial data, date/numeric ranges, and IP addresses. With sensible defaults, and no upfront schema definition necessary, Elasticsearch makes it easy to start simple and fine-tune as datasets grow.
•Powerful query languages. The Elasticsearch query domain specific language is a flexible, expressive search language that exposes a rich set of query capabilities across any kind of data. From simple Boolean operators to custom relevance functions, users can articulate exactly what they are looking for and bring their own definition of relevance. The query language also includes a composable aggregation framework that enables users to summarize, slice, and analyze structured or semi-structured datasets across multiple dimensions. Examples of these capabilities include tracking the top ten users by spend, looking at data week over week, analyzing data across geographies, and drilling down into details with specific filters all with a single search.
•Developer friendliness. Elasticsearch has consistent, well-documented APIs that work the same way on one node during initial development as on a hundred nodes in production. Elasticsearch also ships with a number of language clients that provide a natural way to integrate with a variety of popular programming frameworks, reducing the learning curve, and leading to a shorter time to realizing value.
•High speed. Everything stored in Elasticsearch is indexed by default, such that users do not need to decide in advance what queries they will want to run. Our architecture optimizes throughput, time-to-data availability and query latency. Elasticsearch can easily index millions of events per second, and newly added data can be available for search nearly instantly.
•High scale and availability. Elasticsearch is designed to scale horizontally and be resilient to node or hardware failures. As nodes join a cluster, data is automatically re-balanced and queries and indexing are spread across the new nodes seamlessly. This makes it easy to add hardware to increase indexing throughput or improve query throughput. Elasticsearch also detects node failures and hardware or network issues and automatically protects user data by ejecting the failing or inaccessible nodes and creating new replicas of the data.
•Machine learning and alerting. Machine learning capabilities such as anomaly detection, forecasting, and categorization are tightly integrated with the Elastic Stack to automatically model the behavior of data, such as trends and periodicity, in real time in order to identify issues faster, streamline root cause analysis, and reduce false positives. Without these capabilities, it can be very difficult to identify issues such as infrastructure problems or intruders in real time across complex, high-volume, fast-moving datasets.
•Security. Security features give administrators the rights to grant specific levels of access to their various types of users, such as IT, operations, and application teams. Elasticsearch serves as the central authentication hub for the entire Elastic Stack. Security features include encrypted communications and encryption-at-rest; role-based access control; single sign-on and authentication; field-level, attribute-level, and document-level security; and audit logging.
Kibana is the user interface for the Elastic Stack. It allows users to manage the Elastic Stack and visualize data. Additionally, the interfaces for many of our solutions are built into Kibana. Key features of Kibana include the following:
•Explore and visualize data stored in Elasticsearch. Kibana provides interactive data views, visualizations, and dashboards powered by structured filtering and unstructured search to enable users to get to answers more quickly. A variety of data visualization types, such as simple line and bar charts, purpose-built geospatial and time series visualizations, tree diagrams, network diagrams, heatmaps, scatter plots, and histograms, support diverse user needs.
•Incorporate advanced analytics and machine learning from Elasticsearch. Kibana’s query, filtering, and data summarization capabilities reflect Elasticsearch’s powerful query domain specific language and aggregation framework while making it interactive.
•Manage the Elastic Stack. Kibana presents a broad user interface showing the health of Elastic Stack components and provides cluster alerts to notify administrators of problems. Its central management user interfaces (UIs) make it easier to operate the Elastic Stack at scale.
•Home for Solutions. Kibana is where our users and customers access the user interfaces for our Observability and Security solutions. Kibana provides core services, like security, alerting, and data visualization components. This makes it easy for users to discover all of the capabilities our solutions provide, and enables solution users to benefit from the core capabilities of the Kibana.
•Application framework. Kibana is designed to be extensible. Users interested in a highly specialized visualization type not distributed with Kibana by default can customize experiences through a Kibana plugin and make the plugin available to the community. Dozens of Kibana plugins have been shared by the community via Elastic documentation and code sharing platforms such as GitHub.
Beats, Elastic Agent, and Logstash are data ingestion tools that enable users to collect and enrich any kind of data from any source for storage in Elasticsearch. Beats and Logstash have an extensible modular architecture. Beats are lightweight agents purpose-built for collecting data on devices, servers, and inside containers. Elastic Agent, currently in beta, is a single, unified way to add monitoring for logs, metrics, and other types of data to each host, and also includes integrated host protection. Key features of Beats and Elastic Agent include the following:
•Data shippers. Beats are lightweight agents built for the purposes of efficient data collection at the edge for specific types of data, such as Filebeat for the collection of logging data, Metricbeat for the collection of system or service metric data, Auditbeat for the collection of security data, Packetbeat for the collection of network data, and Heartbeat for the collection of availability data. Dozens of community Beats enable the collection of data from specialized sources. Elastic Agent introduces a new single agent architecture across hosts that simplifies management and deployment.
•Extensibility and community Beats. The Beats platform enables rapid creation of custom Beats that can be run on a variety of edge technologies for data collection. Over 90 Beats have been shared by the community via Elastic documentation and many more are available through code sharing platforms such as GitHub.
•Host protection. Specifically with Elastic Agent, we extend protection to hosts in addition to data transfer. Elastic Agent stops malware and ransomware and enables environment-wide visibility and advanced threat detection.
Logstash enables centralized collection and extract, transformation, and load capabilities. Key features of Logstash include the following:
•Data transformation engine. Logstash is a centralized data transformation engine that can receive and pull data from multiple sources, transform and filter that data, and send it to multiple outputs. Logstash has a powerful and flexible configuration language that allows users to create data stream acquisition and transformation logic without having to write code. This greatly extends and accelerates the ability to create data management pipelines to a wide variety of organizations and individuals.
•Plugins. Logstash collects data from a variety of sources, such as network devices, queues, endpoints, and public cloud services. Logstash enriches the data via lookups against local data sources, such as a geolocation database, and remote data sources, such as relational databases. Logstash can output events to Elasticsearch or downstream queues and other datastores. We develop and support more than 80 plugins for many common integrations.
•Logstash extensibility and community plugins. A vibrant community of users extends our reach through hundreds of community Logstash plugins that enable integration with a wide variety of data sources across many use cases.
Technology Features of Our Solutions
Our solutions are designed to minimize time-to-value and deployment costs of using the Elastic Stack for common use cases. The functionality of our solutions often includes specialized data collection, through standardized APIs or custom agents, and custom user interfaces for specific data analytics, visualizations, workflows, and actions. Most of our solutions can be self-managed or accessed through Elastic Cloud.
Enterprise Search gives users the tools to bring search experiences to customers, partners and teams quickly and scale them seamlessly.
•Workplace Search. Workplace Search brings modern search to collaborative decisions and experiences. It seamlessly connects to some of the world’s most widely adopted productivity tools, customer relationship management platforms, cloud storage platforms, collaboration tools, operation management platforms, and content management systems. Custom sources provide an elegant set of APIs that lets customers and users ingest any type of content from even more sources while preserving access control information.
•App Search. App Search simplifies the process of building excellent customer-facing search experiences. App Search also provides much of the shared, foundational technology that gives the products in Enterprise Search power within an intuitive user experience. App Search brings the focused power of Elasticsearch to a refined set of APIs and intuitive dashboards, allowing users to leverage scalability, tunable relevance controls, thorough documentation, well-maintained clients, and robust analytics to build a leading search experience with ease.
•Site Search. Site Search provides the tools users need to build powerful website search easily. The maintenance-free crawler keeps content current, while intuitive customization features and robust analytics provide full control over search relevance. All these capabilities are backed at scale by Elasticsearch.
Observability combines analysis across the IT ecosystem of IT applications, networks, and infrastructure to deliver actionable insights into performance, availability, usability, adoption, and anomalous behavior.
•Logs. Logs indexes, searches, and analyzes structured and unstructured logs at large scale to monitor the health and performance of an organization’s services, infrastructure, and applications. Users can analyze and visualize information extracted from logs to understand system behavior and trends to optimize performance and preemptively address potential issues. By querying logs in ad hoc ways, users can triage, troubleshoot, and resolve performance issues.
•Metrics. Metrics ingests, searches, visualizes, and analyzes numeric and time series data from IT systems, including applications, datastores, hosts, containers, cloud infrastructure, and more. Users can review performance and utilization trends to optimize and plan for future needs. Metrics helps users deliver on infrastructure service level objectives (“SLOs”), and resolve downtime or performance issues by understanding how the state of individual components fits into the bigger picture.
•APM. APM delivers insight into application performance at the code level. Developers can instrument apps and see the lifecycle of a transaction across services from front end to back end. This can give developers confidence in the code they ship, and can give operational teams visibility into code-level errors and performance bottlenecks to accelerate root cause analysis and resolution during an investigation.
•Uptime. Customers and users leverage Uptime to track and monitor the availability of the hosts, websites, services, and application endpoints that support business operations. Through proactive monitoring, customers can detect troublesome components before they are reported by end users.
Security delivers unified protection to prevent, detect, and respond to a variety of threats across the IT ecosystem.
•SIEM. Elastic SIEM automates threat detection and remediation, reducing mean time to detect (“MTTD”) and mean time to respond (“MTTR”). With prebuilt Beats integrations, SIEM can ingest data from cloud, network, endpoints, applications, and other systems. With Elastic Common Schema (“ECS”), users can centrally analyze information like logs, flows, and contextual data from disparate data sources. SIEM provides an interactive workspace for security teams to detect and respond to threats. Teams can triage events and perform investigations, gathering evidence on an interactive timeline. SIEM also streamlines opening and updating cases, forwarding potential incidents to security operations workflows and IT ticketing systems.
•Endpoint Security. Endpoint Security combines prevention, detection, and response into a single, autonomous agent that can even run in isolated environments. It is designed for ease of use and for speed, and can help stop threats in early stages of an attack. Endpoint Security includes protection against ransomware, malware, phishing, exploits, fileless attacks, and more. When deployed together, SIEM and Endpoint Security provide a strong security posture with broad visibility on potential threats.
Elastic Cloud, Elastic Cloud Enterprise, and Elastic Cloud on Kubernetes
The Elastic Stack and our solutions can be deployed in public or private clouds, in hybrid environments, or in traditional on-premises environments. We divide our deployment models into two categories: self-managed, which refers to users deploying the Elastic Stack and solutions on infrastructure they manage themselves (such as their own data center or private or public cloud environments), and Elastic Cloud, which refers to our SaaS products that we host and manage. To help self-managed users with more complex deployment scenarios, we offer Elastic Cloud Enterprise and Elastic Cloud on Kubernetes.
•Elastic Cloud. Elastic Cloud is our growing family of SaaS products and technologies that make it easy to deploy, operate, and scale Elastic products and solutions in the cloud. Elastic Cloud products include Elasticsearch Service and Site Search Service and are offered by us on certain large cloud providers.
•Elastic Cloud Enterprise and Elastic Cloud on Kubernetes. As part of building our Elastic Cloud offering, we built a comprehensive orchestration and administration infrastructure tool to easily provision, monitor, manage, secure, upgrade and backup the thousands of clusters that comprise our Elastic Cloud products. We then packaged this infrastructure into a downloadable and easily installable proprietary product called Elastic Cloud Enterprise, which makes this tool available to customers to use with their own self-managed deployments. Elastic Cloud Enterprise enables our customers to provision, monitor, manage, secure, upgrade and backup any number of
clusters. It also helps our customers improve their hardware utilization and operational efficiency by allowing them to leverage shared hardware resources to manage multiple clusters, while still maintaining a strong level of isolation between those clusters. More recently, we also launched Elastic Cloud on Kubernetes, extending our cloud orchestration capabilities to Kubernetes environments via the official Elasticsearch operator for Kubernetes.
Community
Our team extends beyond our employee base. It includes all the users who download our software. Our users interact with us on our website forums and on Twitter, GitHub, Stack Overflow, Quora, Facebook, Weibo, WeChat, and more.
In order to build products that best meet our users’ needs, we focus on, and invest in, building a strong community. Each download of the Elastic Stack is a new opportunity to educate our next contributor, hear about a new use case, explore the need for a new feature, or meet a future member of the team. Community is core to our identity, binding our products closely together with our users. Community gives us an ability to get their candid feedback, creating a direct line of communication between our users and the builders of our products across all of our features-including both free and paid capabilities-enabling us to make our products simpler and better.
The Elastic community has a Code of Conduct. It covers the behaviors of the Elastic community in any forum, mailing list, wiki, website, code repository, IRC channel, private correspondence, or public meeting. It is designed to ensure that the Elastic community is a space where members and users can freely and openly communicate, collaborate, and contribute both ideas and code. It also covers our community ground rules: be considerate, be patient, be respectful, be nice, communicate effectively, and ask for help when unsure.
Competition
Our market is highly competitive, rapidly evolving, fragmented, and subject to changing technology, shifting customer needs, and frequent introductions of new offerings. Our principal competitors include:
•For Enterprise Search (app search, site search, and workplace search): incumbent offerings such as Solr (open source offering), Lucidworks Fusion, search tools including Google Custom Search Engine (an advertisement-based site search tool with limited user controls), and workplace search tools including Coveo, Endeca (acquired by Oracle) and Autonomy (acquired by HP and now offered by Micro Focus).
•For Observability (logging, metrics, APM, and uptime monitoring): software vendors with specific observability solutions to analyze logging data, metrics, APM data, or infrastructure uptime, such as Splunk, New Relic, Dynatrace, AppDynamics (owned by Cisco Systems) and Datadog.
•For Security (SIEM and endpoint security): security analytics solutions vendors such as Splunk and Azure Sentinel (offered by Microsoft) and endpoint security vendors such as CrowdStrike, Carbon Black (acquired by VMware), McAfee and Symantec (acquired by Broadcom).
•Certain cloud hosting providers and managed service providers, including Amazon Web Services, that offer products based on older Elastic Stack releases. These offerings are not supported by Elastic and come without any of Elastic’s proprietary features, whether free or paid.
The principal competitive factors for companies in our industry are:
•product capabilities, including speed, scale, and relevance, with which to power search experiences;
•an extensible product “stack” that enables developers to build a wide variety of solutions;
•powerful and flexible technology that can manage a broad variety and large volume of data;
•ease of deployment and ease of use;
•ability to address a variety of evolving customer needs and use cases;
•strength of sales and marketing efforts;
•flexible deployment model across public or private clouds, hybrid environments, or traditional on-premises environments;
•productized solutions engineered to be rapidly adopted to address specific applications;
•mindshare with developers and IT executives;
•adoption of products by many types of users (developers, architects, DevOps personnel, IT professionals, security analysts, and departmental and organizational leaders);
•enterprise-grade technology that is secure and reliable;
•size of customer base and level of user adoption;
•quality of training, consulting, and customer support;
•brand awareness and reputation; and
•low total cost of ownership.
We believe that we compare favorably on the basis of the factors listed above. However, many of our competitors have substantially greater financial, technical and other resources, greater brand recognition, larger sales forces and marketing budgets, broader distribution networks and presence, more established relationships with current or potential customers and partners, more diverse product and services offerings and larger and more mature intellectual property portfolios. They may be able to leverage these resources to gain business in a manner that discourages customers from purchasing our offerings. Furthermore, we expect that our industry will continue to attract new companies, including smaller emerging companies, which could introduce new offerings. We may also expand into new markets and encounter additional competitors in such markets. While our products and solutions have various competitors across different use cases, such as app search, site search, workplace search, logging, metrics, APM, business analytics and security analytics, we believe that few competitors currently have the capabilities to address our entire range of use cases. We believe our industry requires constant change and innovation, and we plan to continue to evolve search as a foundational technology to solve the problems of today and new emerging problems in the future.
Intellectual Property
We rely on a combination of patents, patent applications, registered and unregistered trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, license agreements, confidentiality procedures, non-disclosure agreements with third parties, and other contractual measures to safeguard our core technology and other intellectual property assets. In addition, we maintain a policy requiring our employees, contractors, and consultants to enter into disclosure and invention assignment agreements. As of April 30, 2021, we had 24 issued patents in the United States with expirations ranging from 2031 to 2039, 57 pending U.S. patent applications, and 17 pending non-U.S. patent filings. The pending patent applications, if issued, would expire between 2032 and 2041. In addition, as of April 30, 2021, we had 38 registered trademarks in the United States, 2 pending trademark applications in the United States, as well as 326 registered trademarks in various non-U.S. jurisdictions and no pending trademark applications in various non-U.S. jurisdictions.

Human Capital Management
Our employees (whom we call “Elasticians”) and our culture are vital to Elastic’s long-term success. Our human capital management efforts are focused on:
•Attracting, engaging and retaining talent
•Maintaining our strong company culture
•Enhancing our diversity, equity and inclusion (“DEI”)
•Continuing strong employee engagement
•Facilitating continuous employee learning and development
•Offering effective total rewards, including employee well-being
Our management regularly updates our board of directors and its committees on human capital trends and employee-focused activities and initiatives.
As of April 30, 2021, we had a total of 2,179 employees in over 35 countries globally, including 946 employees located outside of the United States. In addition, approximately 30% of our workforce encompasses women and non-binary employees. None of our employees are represented by a labor union. In certain countries in which we operate, such as France and Spain, we are subject to, and comply with, local labor law requirements which may automatically make our employees subject to industry-wide collective bargaining agreements. We have not experienced any work stoppages.
Our Culture
We describe our culture by the Elastic “source code,” the things that make Elastic, Elastic. Our source code guides our culture, business, product development, people practices and brand. The guiding ideas are:
•Home, Dinner. There is no such thing as work-life balance. We are successful if we find balance in life. Elastic empowers its employees with the flexibility to do so. Be home for dinner, go for a run midday, care for a sick child, or visit a parent. Finding balance means being more innovative and efficient at work. Which makes for a better Elastic.
•Space, Time. It’s easy to get stuck in a day-to-day work pattern. Allowing for the space and time to dream requires conscious effort. Embracing a high failure rate does, too. Fulfillment comes from doing the obvious and dreaming up the un-obvious. Both are foundations of Elastic.
•IT, Depends. It’s pretty complicated to make some things simple, and even more complicated to make other things possible. We embrace and value the knowledge required to do both. When a question is asked, buckle up. Sh*t is about to get real. Your journey will likely start with “it depends.”
•Progress, SIMPLE Perfection. Perfection is not a destination. Color inside the lines or color outside the lines. Just pick a color. It’s as simple as 2048. An Elastic that moves is an Elastic that survives, thrives, and stands the test of time.
•01.02, /FORMAT. Our products are distributed by design, our company is distributed by intention. With many languages, perspectives, and cultures, it’s easy to lose something in translation. Over email and chat, doubly so. Until we get a perpetual empathy machine, don’t assume malice. A distributed Elastic makes for a diverse Elastic, which makes for a better Elastic.
•As YOU, Are. We all come in different shapes with different interests and skills. We all have an accent. Celebrate it. Just come as you are. No need to invest neurons trying to fit an arbitrary mold. We’d rather you put them to work shaping Elastic.
•HUMBLE, Ambitious. Ambition drives us to challenge ourselves and the people around us to do better. It is not an excuse to be an *sshole. Be humble. Be ambitious. At Elastic, we are both.
•Speed, SCALE, Relevance. Elastic is a search company. We focus on value to users by producing fast results that operate at scale and are relevant. This is our DNA. We believe search is an experience. It is what defines us, binds us, and makes us unique.
Elastic was born a distributed company and continues to be distributed by design. We have designed our processes, systems, and teams so that employees can generally perform their jobs without needing to be physically present in the same room or even in the same time zone. Just as distributed systems are more resilient, we believe that being distributed helps build a strong company that can scale and adapt as new challenges arise. Having a distributed workforce gives us a global candidate pool, which gives us the opportunity to cast a wider recruiting net, a critical aspect of helping open our pipelines to a broader set of diverse talent.
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion
Our focus on DEI is critical to how we develop, strengthen and sustain a sense of belonging and inclusion among all Elasticians.
Balanced Teams. We strive to be an employer of choice for a diverse and inclusive workforce through our talent brand, talent attraction, development, and retention efforts. Our recruiting approach is underpinned by the desire to create balanced teams at Elastic, which includes considering broad aspects of diversity from race and gender mix as well as diversity of thought, experience and tenure when recruiting new team members. In fiscal year 2021, the created-by-women-for-women workplace review site, Fairygodboss, recognized Elastic as number one in the Best Technology Company for Women category, and as one of the best workplaces for women in two additional categories: Best Company for Women, and Best Company Where CEOs Support Gender Diversity.
Elastician Resource Groups. We strive to embed DEI deep within our culture through various initiatives, projects and programs, the centerpiece of which is the Elastician Resource Groups (“ERGs”), which are organizationally sponsored, self-organized, Elastician-run groups. Aligned to specific shared identities, interests, affinity or allyship, such as Latinx, parent(s), disability or accessibility, Black, LGBTQ+ and others, each group identifies goals and objectives with executive sponsorship to ensure that they provide tangible benefits and result in all Elasticians feeling a sense of belonging.
Code of Conduct. All of our employees must adhere to a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics (the “Code of Conduct”) that sets standards for appropriate behavior and are required to complete annual training on the Code of Conduct and training to help prevent, identify and report any type of discrimination and harassment.
Employee Engagement
We are committed to ensuring that Elasticians have a voice in how we can collectively make Elastic a better place to work.
New Employee Onboarding. Our new employee onboarding experience is centered around attending “X-School”, our extensive new-hire orientation program, which enables new Elasticians to meet and collaborate with other new Elasticians from around the globe and to learn about our products and solutions.
Engagement Surveys. We maintain a regular pulse on how our employees are feeling through two primary feedback mechanisms - an annual employee engagement survey and a mid-year pulse survey check-in. The results of these surveys are reviewed at the company, functional, team and manager level, with action plans put in place annually. Elasticians were highly engaged in providing feedback in fiscal year 2021, with very high participation rates for the mid-year and annual surveys as well as high engagement scores across a spectrum of questions.
Learning and Development
Our Learning & Organizational Development team’s mission to enable Elasticians to pursue their purpose, in work and life, makes for a better Elastic. To that end, we have a variety of ways in which we support the continuous learning and development of all Elasticians, including access to on-demand video based learning.
We also conduct specific programs to develop managers and leaders at Elastic, including our flagship Leadership Performance Program, an externally-led program focused on high-performing leaders who have the potential to have a significant strategic impact on the achievement of our long-term objectives.
Total Rewards
Compensation, Benefits and Well-being. We provide market competitive compensation which typically includes cash compensation as well as equity awards. Reflecting our interest in the whole person, we provide programs designed to enable Elasticians to meet their well-being goals, from starting a family to being at their physical and emotional best. These programs include market competitive medical and dental programs, in addition to focus on mental health and holistic well-being. We provide market competitive paid time off (“PTO”) programs, including offering 16 weeks of paid leave to all new parents. In addition, we also provide retirement and income protection plans, which include a 401k plan with a dollar-for-dollar match by Elastic up to 6% of eligible earnings up to a plan-limit maximum for U.S.-based Elasticians as well as similar competitive plans outside of the United States.
Fair Pay. We have fair and consistent compensation practices through our use of local third-party market data specific to each country, where available, so that we understand local compensation and cost of labor levels. We retain external experts to review our compensation outcomes on an ongoing basis to ensure they are bias-free and fairly reward employee performance and contributions. We take great pride in our focus on fair pay and the positive results we’ve established. Our external review continues to validate that we have gender-based pay parity between male and female Elasticians globally.
Community Involvement. Through Elastic Cares, employees can support the charitable organizations that matter the most to them on a local and global level. Elastic Cares is a program consisting of donation matching, our nonprofit organization program which provides our technology for free to certain nonprofit organizations, and our volunteer time off (“VTO”) initiative. Employees are encouraged to volunteer for these organizations throughout the year using our VTO program which provides our employees with 40 hours of volunteer time each year.
COVID-19 Response
During the COVID-19 pandemic, our primary focus was and continues to be on the safety and well-being of our employees and their families. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, we closed our offices globally and required our employees to
work remotely. Additionally, due to concerns over risks related to travel and large gatherings, we have replaced our in-person events, including our internal global all-hands, annual flagship conference and other in-person marketing events, with web-based virtual events. Given the significant personal and professional impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, we provided reimbursements for home office equipment and established specific learning opportunities for our employees that allowed teams to better connect to each other, including fun activities to help teams bond. To allow employees to deal with and alleviate the physical, mental, and emotional effects of the pandemic on themselves and loved ones, we offered two weeks of COVID leave and implemented company-wide days off called “Shut it Down Days” twice per month.
Government Regulations
Our worldwide business activities are subject to various laws, rules, and regulations of the United States as well as of foreign governments. Compliance with these laws, rules, and regulations has not had, and is not expected to have, a material effect upon our capital expenditures, results of operations, or competitive position. Nevertheless, compliance with existing or future governmental regulations, including, but not limited to, those pertaining to global trade, business acquisitions, consumer and data protection, and taxes, could have a material impact on our business. Refer to Item 1A, “Risk Factors-Risks Related to Regulatory Matters” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K” for a discussion of these potential impacts.

Risks Related to our Business and Industry
Our business and operations have experienced rapid growth, and if we do not appropriately manage future growth, if any, or are unable to improve our systems and processes, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects will be adversely affected.
We have experienced rapid growth and increased demand for our offerings. Our employee headcount and number of customers have increased significantly. For example, our total number of customers has grown from over 2,800 as of April 30, 2017 to over 15,000 as of April 30, 2021. Further, our employee headcount is growing as we modify our pace of hiring in light of our growth plans. The growth and expansion of our business and offerings places a continuous and significant strain on our management, operational, and financial resources. In addition, as customers adopt our technology for an increasing number of use cases, we have had to support more complex commercial relationships. We may not be able to hire, train and retain enough qualified employees, and we may not be able to hire and train new employees fast enough, to maintain our growth plans. We must continue to improve and expand our information technology and financial infrastructure, our operating and administrative systems, our relationships with various partners and other third parties, and our ability to manage headcount and processes in an efficient manner to manage our growth to date and any future growth effectively.
We may not be able to sustain the diversity and pace of improvements to our offerings successfully or implement systems, processes, and controls in an efficient or timely manner or in a manner that does not negatively affect our results of operations. Our failure to improve our systems, processes, and controls, or their failure to operate in the intended manner, may result in our inability to manage the growth of our business and to forecast our revenue, expenses, and earnings accurately, or to prevent losses.
As we expand our business and operate as a public company, we may find it difficult to maintain our corporate culture while managing our employee growth. Any failure to manage our anticipated growth and related organizational changes in a manner that preserves our culture could negatively impact future growth and achievement of our business objectives. Additionally, our productivity and the quality of our offerings may be adversely affected if we do not integrate and train our new employees quickly and effectively. Failure to manage any future growth effectively could result in increased costs, negatively affect our customers’ satisfaction with our offerings, and harm our results of operations.
We have a history of losses and may not be able to achieve profitability on a consistent basis or at all, and may not be able to achieve positive cash flows on a consistent basis. As a result, our business, financial condition, and results of operations may suffer.
We have incurred losses in all years since our incorporation. We incurred a net loss of $129.4 million, $167.2 million and, $102.3 million in the years ended April 30, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. As a result, we had an accumulated deficit of $613.3 million as of April 30, 2021. We anticipate that our operating expenses will increase substantially in the foreseeable future as we continue to enhance our offerings, broaden our customer base and pursue larger transactions, expand our sales and marketing activities, expand our operations, hire additional employees, and continue to develop our technology. These efforts
may prove more expensive than we currently anticipate, and we may not succeed in increasing our revenue sufficiently, or at all, to offset these higher expenses. Revenue growth may slow or revenue may decline for a number of possible reasons, including slowing demand for our offerings, increasing competition, or economic downturns, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. You should not consider our revenue growth in recent periods as indicative of our future performance. Any failure to increase our revenue or grow our business could prevent us from achieving profitability at all or on a consistent basis, which would cause our business, financial condition, and results of operations to suffer. Additionally, although we generated positive cash flow in fiscal 2021, any failure to grow our business could prevent us from achieving positive cash flow on a consistent basis, which would cause our business, financial condition, and results of operations to suffer.
We may not be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors.
The market for our products is highly competitive, quickly evolving, and subject to rapid changes in technology. We believe that our ability to compete depends upon many factors both within and beyond our control, including the following:
•product capabilities, including speed, scale, and relevance, with which to power search experiences;
•an extensible product “stack” that enables developers to build a wide variety of solutions;
•powerful and flexible technology that can manage a broad variety and large volume of data;
•ease of deployment and ease of use;
•ability to address a variety of evolving customer needs and use cases;
•strength and execution of sales and marketing strategies;
•flexible deployment model across public or private clouds, hybrid environments, or traditional on-premises environments;
•productized solutions engineered to be rapidly adopted to address specific applications;
•mindshare with developers and IT executives;
•adoption of products by many types of users and decision makers (developers, architects, DevOps personnel, IT professionals, security analysts, and departmental and organizational leaders);
•enterprise-grade technology that is secure and reliable;
•size of customer base and level of user adoption;
•quality of training, consulting, and customer support;
•brand awareness and reputation; and
•low total cost of ownership.
We face competition from both established and emerging competitors. Our current primary competitors generally fall into the following categories:
•For Enterprise Search (app search, site search, and workplace search): incumbent offerings such as Solr (open source offering), Lucidworks Fusion, search tools including Google Custom Search Engine (an advertisement-based site search tool with limited user controls), and workplace search tools including Coveo, Endeca (owned by Oracle) and Autonomy (owned by Micro Focus).
•For Observability (logging, metrics, APM, and uptime monitoring): software vendors with specific observability solutions to analyze logging data, metrics, APM data, or infrastructure uptime, such as Splunk, New Relic, Dynatrace, AppDynamics (owned by Cisco Systems) and Datadog.
•For Security (SIEM and endpoint security): security analytics solutions vendors such as Splunk and Azure Sentinel (by Microsoft) and endpoint security vendors such as CrowdStrike, Carbon Black (owned by VMware), McAfee and Symantec (owned by Broadcom).
•Certain cloud hosting providers and managed service providers, including Amazon Web Services, that offer products based on older Elastic Stack releases. These offerings are not supported by Elastic and come without any of Elastic’s proprietary features, whether free or paid.
Some of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories, significantly greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources, stronger brand recognition, broader global distribution and presence, more established relationships with current or potential customers and partners, and larger customer bases than we do. These factors may allow our competitors to respond more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer preferences.
These competitors may engage in more extensive research and development efforts, undertake more far-reaching and successful sales and marketing campaigns, have more experienced sales professionals, execute more successfully on their go-to-market strategy and have greater access to more markets and decision makers, and adopt more aggressive pricing policies which may allow them to build larger customer bases than we have. New start-up companies that innovate and large competitors that are making significant investments in research and development may develop similar offerings that compete with our offerings or that achieve greater market acceptance than our offerings. This could attract customers away from our offerings and reduce our market share. If we are unable to anticipate or react to these competitive challenges, our competitive position would weaken, which would adversely affect our business and results of operations.
Our limited operating history makes it difficult to evaluate our current business and prospects and may increase the risks associated with your investment.
We were founded in 2012. Our limited operating history makes it difficult to evaluate our current business and our future prospects, including our ability to plan for and model future growth. We have encountered and will continue to encounter risks and difficulties frequently experienced by rapidly growing companies in constantly evolving industries, including the risks described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. If we do not address these risks successfully, our business and results of operations will be adversely affected, and the market price of our ordinary shares could decline.
Further, we have limited historical financial data, and we operate in a rapidly evolving market. As such, any predictions about our future revenue and expenses may not be as accurate as they would be if we had a longer operating history or operated in a more predictable market.
If we are not able to keep pace with technological and competitive developments, our business will be harmed.
The market for search technologies, including enterprise search, observability and security, is subject to rapid technological change, evolving industry standards, and changing regulations, as well as changing customer needs, requirements and preferences. Our success depends upon our ability to enhance existing products, expand the use cases of our products, anticipate and respond to changing customer needs, requirements and preferences, and develop and introduce in a timely manner new offerings that keep pace with technological and competitive developments. We have in the past experienced delays in releasing new products, deployment options and product enhancements and may experience similar delays in the future. As a result, in the past, some of our customers deferred purchasing our products until the next upgrade was released. Future delays or problems in the installation or implementation of our new releases may cause customers to forgo purchases of our products and purchase those of our competitors instead.
Additionally, the success of new product introductions depends on a number of factors including, but not limited to, timely and successful product development, market acceptance, our ability to manage the risks associated with new product releases, the availability of software components for new products, the effective management of development and other spending in connection with anticipated demand for new products, the availability of newly developed products, and the risk that new products may have bugs, errors, or other defects or deficiencies in the early stages of introduction. We have in the past experienced bugs, errors, or other defects or deficiencies in new products and product updates and may have similar experiences in the future. Furthermore, our ability to increase the usage of our products depends, in part, on the development of new use cases for our products, which is typically driven by our developer community and may be outside of our control. We also have invested, and may continue to invest, in the acquisition of complementary businesses, technologies, services, products and other assets that expand the products that we can offer our customers, such as our acquisition of Endgame in October 2019. We may make these investments without being certain that they will result in products or enhancements that will be accepted by existing or prospective customers. Additionally, even if we are able to develop new products and product enhancements, we cannot ensure that they will achieve market acceptance. If we are unable to successfully enhance our existing products to meet evolving customer requirements, increase adoption and usage of our products, develop new products, or if our efforts to increase the usage of our products are more expensive than we expect, then our business, results of operations and financial condition would be adversely affected.
The markets for some of our products are evolving, and our future success depends on the growth and expansion of these markets and our ability to adapt and respond effectively to evolving markets.
The markets for certain of our products, such as our Enterprise Search, Observability and Security solutions, are evolving and our products are relatively new in these markets. Accordingly, it is difficult to predict continued customer adoption and renewals for these products, customers’ demand for these products, the size, growth rate, expansion, and longevity of these markets, the entry of competitive products, or the success of existing competitive products. Our ability to penetrate these evolving markets depends on a number of factors, including the cost, performance, and perceived value associated with our products. If these markets do not continue to grow as expected, or if we are unable to anticipate or react to changes in these markets, our competitive position would weaken, which would adversely affect our business and results of operations.
The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic could harm our business and results of operations.
The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and efforts to control its spread have significantly curtailed the movement of people, goods and services worldwide, including in most or all of the regions in which we sell our products and services and conduct our business operations, negatively impacting worldwide economic activity. We have taken precautionary measures intended to help minimize the risk of the virus to our employees, our customers, and the communities in which we operate. The continued spread of the COVID-19 pandemic and the resurgence of infection rates in certain regions has caused us to continue to modify our business practices (including suspending employee travel, adapting employee work locations, and holding events and trainings virtually), and we may take further actions as may be required by government authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, customers, and business partners. There is no certainty that such measures will be sufficient to mitigate the risks posed by the virus or otherwise be satisfactory to government authorities. The full extent to which COVID-19 and our precautionary measures may continue to impact our business will depend on future developments, which continue to be highly uncertain and cannot be predicted at this time, including but not limited to, the duration and geographic spread of the pandemic, its severity, the actions to contain the virus or treat its impact, future spikes of COVID-19 infections resulting in additional preventative measures to contain or mitigate the spread of the virus, the effectiveness, distribution and acceptance of COVID-19 vaccines, including the vaccines’ efficacy against emerging COVID-19 variants, and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume. It has been and, until the COVID-19 pandemic is contained and global economic activity stabilizes, will continue to be more difficult for us to forecast our operating results. The magnitude and duration of the disruption and resulting decline in business activity remains uncertain and could negatively impact our sales and marketing efforts, our ability to enter into customer contracts in a timely manner, our international expansion efforts, our ability to deliver professional services, our ability to recruit employees across the organization which, in turn, could have longer term effects on our sales pipeline, or create operational or other challenges, any of which could harm our business. Additionally, as we begin to re-open certain of our offices where local authorities have indicated it is safe to do so, our efforts to re-open them safely may not be successful, could expose our personnel to health risks and could involve additional costs that may adversely affect our business.
In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted, and may continue to disrupt, the operations of our customers, vendors, channel partners and government entities for an indefinite period of time, including as a result of travel restrictions and/or business shutdowns, all of which could negatively impact our business and results of operations, including cash flows. Further, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has varied significantly across different industries with certain industries experiencing increased demand for their products and services as the needs of the economy shift, while others have struggled to maintain demand for their products and services consistent with historical levels. Because we have a limited history in understanding these impacts, our ability to adapt our sales and marketing initiatives to such changes may be uncertain and our ability to forecast rates of customer retention and expansion may be negatively impacted.
Even after the COVID-19 pandemic has subsided, we may continue to experience materially adverse impacts to our business as a result of its global economic impact, including any recession, economic downturn, or increased unemployment that has occurred or may occur in the future. There has been increased scrutiny of business (including technology) spending by our customers and prospective customers, particularly in industries most impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, longer sales cycles, as well as reduced demand for our solutions, customers failing to pay us under the terms of our agreements, increased cyber threats, lower renewal rates by our customers and increased competition, all of which could result in a material adverse impact on our business operations and financial condition. For instance, our Net Expansion Rate declined to below 130% at the end of fiscal 2021 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, which caused customers to expand their spending with us at a slower rate than before the COVID-19 pandemic.
While we have developed and continue to develop plans intended to help mitigate the negative impacts of the pandemic on our business, these efforts may not be effective and a protracted economic downturn may limit the effectiveness of our mitigation efforts.
Our operating results are likely to fluctuate from quarter to quarter, and our financial results in any one quarter should not be relied upon as indicative of future performance.
Our results of operations, including our revenue, cost of revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, cash flow and deferred revenue, have fluctuated from quarter-to-quarter in the past and may continue to vary significantly in the future so that period-to-period comparisons of our results of operations may not be meaningful. Accordingly, our financial results in any one quarter should not be relied upon as indicative of future performance. Our quarterly financial results may fluctuate as a result of a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control, may be difficult to predict, and may or may not fully reflect the underlying performance of our business. Factors that may cause fluctuations in our quarterly financial results include:
•our ability to attract new and retain existing customers;
•the loss of existing customers;
•customer renewal rates;
•our ability to successfully expand our business in the U.S. and internationally;
•our ability to foster an ecosystem of developers and users to expand the use cases of our products;
•our ability to gain new partners and retain existing partners;
•fluctuations in the growth rate of the overall market that our products address;
•fluctuations in the mix of our revenue, which may impact our gross margins and operating income;
•the amount and timing of operating expenses related to the maintenance and expansion of our business and operations, including investments in sales and marketing, research and development and general and administrative resources;
•network outages or performance degradation of Elastic Cloud;
•actual or perceived breaches of, or failures relating to, privacy, data protection or information security;
•additions or departures of key personnel;
•the impact of catastrophic events, man-made problems such as terrorism, natural disasters and public health epidemics and pandemics;
•general political, economic, industry and market conditions, including developments resulting from the change of administration in the United States;
•increases or decreases in the number of elements of our subscriptions or pricing changes upon any renewals of customer agreements;
•changes in our pricing policies or those of our competitors;
•the budgeting cycles and purchasing practices of customers;
•decisions by potential customers to purchase alternative solutions;
•decisions by potential customers to develop in-house solutions as alternatives to our products;
•insolvency or credit difficulties confronting our customers, which could adversely affect their ability to purchase or pay for our offerings;
•our ability to collect timely on invoices or receivables;
•delays in our ability to fulfill our customers’ orders;
•the cost and potential outcomes of future litigation or other disputes;
•future accounting pronouncements or changes in our accounting policies;
•our overall effective tax rate, including impacts caused by any reorganization in our corporate tax structure and any new legislation or regulatory developments;
•fluctuations in stock-based compensation expense;
•fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates;
•the timing and success of new offerings introduced by us or our competitors or any other change in the competitive dynamics of our industry, including consolidation among competitors, customers or partners;
•the timing of expenses related to the development or acquisition of technologies or businesses and potential future charges for impairment of goodwill from acquired companies; and
•other risk factors described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
The impact of one or more of the foregoing or other factors may cause our operating results to vary significantly. For example, the full impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is unknown and continues to evolve rapidly, and could result in material adverse changes in our results of operations for an unknown period of time as the virus and its related political, social and economic impacts spread. Such fluctuations could cause us to fail to meet the expectations of investors or securities analysts, which could cause the trading price of our ordinary shares to fall substantially, and we could face costly lawsuits, including securities class action suits, which could have an adverse effect on our business.
If we are unable to increase sales of our subscriptions to new customers, sell additional subscriptions to our existing customers, or expand the value of our existing customers’ subscriptions, our future revenue and results of operations will be harmed.
We offer certain features of our products with no payment required. Customers purchase subscriptions in order to gain access to additional functionality and support. Our future success depends on our ability to sell our subscriptions to new customers, including to large enterprises, and to expand the deployment of our offerings with existing customers by selling paid subscriptions to our existing users and expanding the value and number of existing customers’ subscriptions. Our ability to sell new subscriptions depends on a number of factors, including the prices of our offerings, the prices of products offered by our competitors, and the budgets of our customers. We also face difficulty in displacing the products of incumbent competitors. In addition, a significant aspect of our sales and marketing focus is to expand deployments within existing customers. The rate at which our existing customers purchase additional subscriptions and expand the value of existing subscriptions depends on a number of factors, including customers’ level of satisfaction with our offerings, the nature and size of the deployments, the desire to address additional use cases, and the perceived need for additional features, as well as general economic conditions. If our existing customers do not purchase additional subscriptions or expand the value of their subscriptions, our Net Expansion Rate may decline. We rely in large part on our customers to identify new use cases for our products in order to expand such deployments and grow our business. If our customers do not recognize the potential of our offerings, our business would be materially and adversely affected. If our efforts to sell subscriptions to new customers and to expand deployments at existing customers are not successful, our total revenue and revenue growth rate may decline and our business will suffer.
If our existing customers do not renew their subscriptions, it could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
We expect to derive a significant portion of our revenue from renewals of existing subscriptions. Our customers have no contractual obligation to renew their subscriptions after the completion of their subscription term. Our subscriptions for self-managed deployments typically range from one to three years, while many of our Elastic Cloud customers purchase subscriptions either on a month-to-month basis or on a committed contract of at least one year in duration.
Our customers’ renewal rates may decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including their satisfaction with our products and our customer support, our products’ ability to integrate with new and changing technologies, the frequency and severity of product outages, our product uptime or latency, and the pricing of our, or competing, products. If our customers renew their subscriptions, they may renew for shorter subscription terms or on other terms that are less economically beneficial to us. We may not accurately predict future renewal trends. If our existing customers do not renew their subscriptions, or renew on less favorable terms, our revenue may grow more slowly than expected or decline.
Our decision to no longer offer Elasticsearch and Kibana under an open source license may harm the adoption of Elasticsearch and Kibana.
In February 2021, with the release of version 7.11 of the Elastic Stack, we changed the source code of Elasticsearch and Kibana that had historically been licensed under Apache 2.0, to be dual licensed under the Elastic License 2.0 (“ELv2”) and the Server Side Public License Version 1.0 (“SSPL”), at the user’s election. Neither the Elastic License nor the SSPL has been approved by the Open Source Initiative or is included in the Free Software Foundation’s list of free software licenses. Further, neither has been interpreted by any court. While the vast majority of downloads of Elasticsearch and Kibana from mid-2018 through early 2021 were licensed under the Elastic License, the removal of the Apache 2.0 alternative could negatively impact certain developers for whom the availability of an open source license was important. In addition, some developers and the companies for whom they work may be hesitant to download or upgrade to new versions of Elasticsearch or Kibana under the Elastic License or SSPL because of uncertainty around how these licenses may be interpreted and enforced. Other developers, including competitors of Elastic such as Amazon, have announced that they have “forked” Elasticsearch and Kibana. In doing so, they will develop a new product based on the software, which they claim will continue to be licensed under Apache 2.0. The combination of uncertainty around our dual license model and the potential competition from the forked versions of our software may negatively impact adoption of Elasticsearch and Kibana, which in turn could lead to reduced brand and product awareness, ultimately leading to a decline in paying customers, which could harm our ability to grow our business or achieve profitability.
We could be negatively impacted if the Elastic License or SSPL under which some of our software is licensed are not enforceable.
We make the source code of our products available under Apache 2.0, the Elastic License, or dual licensed under the Elastic License and SSPL, depending on the product and version. Apache 2.0 is a permissive open source license that allows licensees to freely copy, modify and distribute Apache 2.0-licensed software provided that they meet certain conditions. The Elastic License is our proprietary source available license. The Elastic License permits licensees to use, copy, modify and
distribute the licensed software provided that they do not offer access to the software as a cloud service, interfere with the license key or remove proprietary notices. SSPL is a source available license that is based on the GNU Affero General Public License (“AGPL”) open source license and permits licensees to copy, modify and distribute SSPL-licensed software, but expressly requires licensees that offer the SSPL-licensed software as a third-party service to open source all of the software that they use to offer such service. We rely upon the enforceability of the restrictions set forth in the Elastic License and SSPL to protect our proprietary interests. It is possible that a court could hold that the Elastic License or SSPL are unenforceable. If a court held that the Elastic License or SSPL or certain aspects of these licenses are unenforceable, others may be able to use our software to compete with us in the marketplace in a manner not subject to the restrictions set forth in the Elastic License or SSPL.
Because of the permissive rights accorded to third parties under our open source and source available licenses, there are limited technological barriers to entry into the markets in which we compete and it may be relatively easy for competitors, some of whom may have greater resources than we have, to enter our markets and compete with us.
Anyone may obtain access to source code for the features of our software that we have licensed under open source or source available licenses. Depending on the product and version of the Elastic software, this source code is either available under Apache 2.0, SSPL, or the Elastic License. Each of these licenses allow anyone, subject to compliance with the conditions of the applicable license, to redistribute our software in modified or unmodified form and use it to compete in our markets. Such competition can develop without the degree of overhead and lead time required by traditional proprietary software companies, due to the rights granted to licensees of open source and source available software. It is possible for competitors to develop their own software, including software based on our products, potentially reducing the demand for our products and putting pricing pressure on our subscriptions. For example, Amazon offers some of the features that we had previously made available under an open source license as part of its Amazon Web Services offering. As such, Amazon competes with us for potential customers, and while Amazon cannot provide our proprietary software, Amazon’s offerings may reduce the demand for our offerings and the pricing of Amazon’s offerings may limit our ability to adjust the price of our products. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors or that competitive pressure or the availability of new software will not result in price reductions, reduced operating margins and loss of market share, any one of which could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
Our ability to grow our business will depend, in part, on the expansion and adoption of our SaaS offerings.
We believe our future success will depend, in part, on the growth in the adoption of Elastic Cloud, our family of SaaS products. We have and will continue to incur substantial costs to develop, sell and support our Elastic Cloud offerings. We believe that we must offer a family of SaaS products to address the market segment that prefers a cloud-based solution to a self-managed solution and that there will be increasing demand for cloud-based offerings of our products. In the years ended April 30, 2021, 2020 and 2019, Elastic Cloud contributed 27%, 22% and 17% of our total revenue, respectively. However, as the use of cloud-based computing solutions is rapidly evolving, it is difficult to predict the potential growth, if any, of general market adoption, customer adoption and retention rates of our cloud-based offerings. There could be decreased demand for our cloud-based offerings due to reasons within or outside of our control, including, among other things, lack of customer acceptance, technological challenges with bringing cloud offerings to market and maintaining those offerings, security or privacy concerns, our inability to properly manage and support our cloud-based offerings, competing technologies and products, weakening economic conditions, and decreases in corporate spending. For example, Amazon Web Services offers SaaS products based on older Elastic Stack releases. As such, Amazon competes with us for potential customers, and while Amazon cannot provide our proprietary software, Amazon's offerings may reduce the demand for our offerings and the pricing of Amazon's offerings may limit our ability to adjust the price of our products. If we are not able to develop, market or deliver cloud-based offerings that satisfy customer requirements technically or commercially, or if our investments in cloud-based offerings do not yield the expected return, or if we are unable to decrease the cost of providing our cloud-based offerings, our business, competitive position, financial condition and results of operations may be harmed.
If we do not effectively develop and expand our sales and marketing capabilities, including expanding and training our sales force, we may be unable to add new customers, increase sales to existing customers or expand the value of our existing customers’ subscriptions and our business will be adversely affected.
We dedicate significant resources to sales and marketing initiatives, which require us to invest significant financial and other resources, including in markets in which we have limited or no experience. Our business and results of operations will be harmed if our sales and marketing efforts do not generate significant revenue increases or increases that are smaller than anticipated.
We may not achieve revenue growth from expanding our sales force if we are unable to hire, train, and retain talented and effective sales personnel. We depend on our sales force to obtain new customers and to drive additional sales to existing customers. We believe that there is significant competition for sales personnel, including sales representatives, sales managers,
and sales engineers, with the requisite skills and technical knowledge. Our ability to achieve significant revenue growth will depend, in large part, on our success in recruiting, training and retaining sufficient sales personnel to support our growth, and as we introduce new products, solutions and marketing strategies, we may need to re-train existing sales personnel. New hires require significant training and may take significant time before they achieve full productivity. Our recent hires and planned hires may not become productive as quickly as we expect, and we may be unable to hire or retain sufficient numbers of qualified individuals in the markets where we do business or plan to do business. In addition, particularly as we continue to grow rapidly, a large percentage of our sales force will have relatively little experience working with us, our subscriptions, and our business model. If we are unable to hire and train sufficient numbers of effective sales personnel, our new and existing sales personnel are unable to achieve desired productivity levels in a reasonable period of time, our sales personnel are not successful in obtaining new customers or increasing sales to our existing customer base, or our sales and marketing programs are not effective, our growth and results of operations could be negatively impacted and our business will be harmed.
Our ability to increase sales of our offerings is highly dependent on the quality of our customer support, and our failure to offer high quality support would have an adverse effect on our business, reputation and results of operations.
After our products are deployed within our customers’ IT environments, our customers depend on our technical support services to resolve issues relating to our products. If we do not succeed in helping our customers quickly resolve post-deployment issues or provide effective ongoing support and education on our products, our ability to sell additional subscriptions to existing customers or expand the value of existing customers’ subscriptions would be adversely affected and our reputation with potential customers could be damaged. Many larger enterprise and government entity customers have more complex IT environments and require higher levels of support than smaller customers. If we fail to meet the requirements of these enterprise customers, it may be more difficult to grow sales with them.
Additionally, it can take several months to recruit, hire, and train qualified technical support employees. We may not be able to hire such resources fast enough to keep up with demand, particularly if the sales of our offerings exceed our internal forecasts. Due to the ongoing uncertainty related to the COVID-19 pandemic, there may also be more competition for qualified employees and delays in hiring, onboarding and training new employees. To the extent that we are unsuccessful in hiring, training, and retaining adequate support resources, our ability to provide adequate and timely support to our customers, and our customers’ satisfaction with our offerings, will be adversely affected. Our failure to provide and maintain, or a market perception that we do not provide or maintain, high-quality support services would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
We rely significantly on revenue from subscriptions and, because we recognize a significant portion of the revenue from subscriptions over the term of the relevant subscription period, downturns or upturns in sales are not immediately reflected in full in our results of operations.
Subscription revenue accounts for the substantial majority of our revenue, comprising 93%, 92% and 91% of total revenue in the years ended April 30, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. We recognize a significant portion of our subscription revenue monthly over the term of the relevant time period. As a result, much of the subscription revenue we report each fiscal quarter is the recognition of deferred revenue from subscription contracts entered into during previous fiscal quarters. Consequently, a decline in new or renewed subscriptions in any one fiscal quarter will not be fully or immediately reflected in revenue in that fiscal quarter and will negatively affect our revenue in future fiscal quarters. Accordingly, the effect of significant downturns in new or renewed sales of our subscriptions is not reflected in full in our results of operations until future periods.
A real or perceived defect, security vulnerability, error, or performance failure in our software could cause us to lose revenue, damage our reputation, and expose us to liability.
Our products are inherently complex and, despite extensive testing and quality control, have in the past and may in the future contain defects or errors, especially when first introduced, or otherwise not perform as contemplated. These defects, security vulnerabilities, errors or performance failures could cause damage to our reputation, loss of customers or revenue, product returns, order cancellations, service terminations, or lack of market acceptance of our software. As the use of our products, including products that were recently acquired or developed, expands to more sensitive, secure, or mission critical uses by our customers, we may be subject to increased scrutiny, potential reputational risk, or potential liability should our software fail to perform as contemplated in such deployments. We have in the past and may in the future need to issue corrective releases of our software to fix these defects, errors or performance failures, which could require us to allocate significant research and development and customer support resources to address these problems.
Any limitation of liability provisions that may be contained in our customer and partner agreements may not be effective as a result of existing or future applicable law or unfavorable judicial decisions. The sale and support of our products
entail the risk of liability claims, which could be substantial in light of the use of our products in enterprise-wide environments. In addition, our insurance against this liability may not be adequate to cover a potential claim.
Incorrect implementation or use of, or our customers’ failure to update, our software could result in customer dissatisfaction and negatively affect our business, operations, financial results, and growth prospects.
Our products are often operated in large scale, complex IT environments. Our customers and some partners require training and experience in the proper use of and the benefits that can be derived from our products to maximize their potential. If our products are not implemented, configured, updated or used correctly or as intended, or in a timely manner, inadequate performance, errors, loss of data, corruptions and/or security vulnerabilities may result. For example, there have been and may in the future continue to be, reports of our customers not properly securing implementations of our products, which can result in unprotected data. Because our customers rely on our software to manage a wide range of operations, the incorrect implementation, use of, or our customers’ failure to update, our software or our failure to train customers on how to use our software productively may result in customer dissatisfaction, negative publicity and may adversely affect our reputation and brand. Failure by us to effectively provide training and implementation services to our customers could result in lost opportunities for follow-on sales to these customers and decrease subscriptions by new customers, and adversely affect our business and growth prospects.
If third parties offer inadequate or defective implementations of software that we have previously made available under an open source license, our reputation could be harmed.
Certain cloud hosting providers and managed service providers, including Amazon Web Services, offer SaaS products based on older Elastic Stack releases, using the names of our products in marketing such offerings. These offerings are not supported by us and come without any of our proprietary features. We do not control how these third parties may use or offer our open source technology. These third parties could inadequately or incorrectly implement our open source technology, or fail to update such technology in light of changing technological or security requirements, which could result in real or perceived defects, security vulnerabilities, errors, or performance failures with respect to their offerings. Users, customers, and potential customers could confuse these third-party products with our products, and attribute such defects, security vulnerabilities, errors, or performance failures to our products. Any damage to our reputation and brand from defective implementations of our open source software could result in lost sales and lack of market acceptance of our products and could adversely affect our business and growth prospects.
We rely on traditional web search engines to direct traffic to our website. If our website fails to rank prominently in unpaid search results, traffic to our website could decline and our business would be adversely affected.
Our success depends in part on our ability to attract users through unpaid Internet search results on traditional web search engines, such as Google. The number of users we attract to our website from search engines is due in large part to how and where our website ranks in unpaid search results. These rankings can be affected by a number of factors, many of which are not in our direct control, and they may change frequently. For example, a search engine may change its ranking algorithms, methodologies or design layouts. As a result, links to our website may not be prominent enough to drive traffic to our website, and we may not know how or otherwise be in a position to influence the results. Any reduction in the number of users directed to our website could reduce our revenue or require us to increase our customer acquisition expenditures.
If our security measures are breached or unauthorized access to private or proprietary data is otherwise obtained, our software may be perceived as not being secure, customers may reduce the use of or stop using our products, and we may incur significant liabilities.
Any security breach, including those resulting from a cybersecurity attack, phishing attack, or any unauthorized access, unauthorized usage, virus, malware, ransomware or similar breach or disruption to our networks and systems, or those of third parties upon which we rely, could result in the loss of confidential information, damage to our reputation, litigation, regulatory investigations or other liabilities. These attacks may come from individual hackers, criminal groups, and state-sponsored organizations. Cyber threats are constantly evolving and becoming increasingly sophisticated and complex, increasing the difficulty of detecting and successfully defending against them. As a provider of security solutions, we may be specifically targeted by bad actors for attacks intended to circumvent our security capabilities as an entry point into customers’ endpoints, networks, or systems. If our security measures are breached as a result of third-party action, employee error, defect or bug in our products, malfeasance or otherwise and, as a result, someone obtains unauthorized access to our confidential information or personal information or the confidential information or personal information of our customers, our reputation may be damaged, our business may suffer and we could incur significant liability. Even the perception of inadequate security may damage our reputation and negatively impact our ability to win new customers and retain existing customers. Further, we could be required to expend significant capital and other resources to address any data security incident or breach.
In addition, many of our customers may use our software for processing their sensitive and proprietary information, including business strategies, financial and operational data, personal or identifying information and other related data. As a result, unauthorized access or use of this data could result in the loss, compromise, corruption or destruction of our customers’ sensitive and proprietary information and lead to litigation, regulatory investigations and claims, indemnity obligations, and other liabilities. It could also hinder our ability to obtain and maintain information security certifications that support customers’ adoption of our products and our retention of those customers. We have implemented administrative, technical and physical measures designed to protect the integrity of customer information and prevent data loss, misappropriation and other security breaches and incidents and may incur significant costs in connection with the implementation of additional preventative measures in the future.
We engage third-party vendors and service providers to store and otherwise process some of our and our customers’ data, including sensitive and personal information. There have been and may continue to be significant supply chain cyber attacks generally, and our third-party vendors and service providers may be targeted or impacted by such attacks. We cannot guarantee that our or our third-party vendors and service providers’ systems and networks have not been breached or that they do not contain exploitable defects or bugs that could result in a breach of or disruption to our systems and networks or the systems and networks of third parties that support us and our services. Our ability to monitor our third-party vendors and service providers’ data security is limited, and, in any event, third parties may be able to circumvent those security measures, resulting in the unauthorized access to, misuse, disclosure, loss or destruction of our and our customers’ data, including sensitive and personal information.
Techniques used to sabotage or obtain unauthorized access to systems or networks are constantly evolving and, in some instances, are not identified until launched against a target. We and our service providers may be unable to anticipate these techniques, react in a timely manner, or implement adequate preventative measures. Security risks are also heightened during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic as more individuals are working remotely and utilizing home networks for transmitting information, and reported ransomware incidents with significant operational impacts also appear to be escalating in frequency and degree. In addition, laws, regulations, government guidance, and industry standards and practices in the United States and elsewhere are rapidly evolving to combat these threats. We may face increased compliance burdens regarding such requirements with regulators and customers regarding our products and services and also incur additional costs for oversight and monitoring of our own supply chain. We and our customers may also experience increased costs associated with security measures and increased risk of suffering cyberattacks, including ransomware. Should we or the third-party vendors upon which we rely experience such attacks, including from ransomware, our operations may also be hindered or interrupted, with foreseeable secondary contractual, regulatory, financial, and reputational harms that may arise from such an incident.
Further, we cannot assure that any limitations of liability provisions in our customer and user agreements, contracts with third-party vendors and service providers or other contracts would be enforceable or adequate or would otherwise protect us from any liabilities or damages with respect to any particular claim relating to a security breach or other security-related matter. We also cannot be sure that our existing insurance coverage will continue to be available on acceptable terms or will be available in sufficient amounts to cover claims related to a security incident or breach, or that the insurer will not deny coverage as to any future claim. The successful assertion of claims against us that exceed available insurance coverage, or the occurrence of changes in our insurance policies, including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or co-insurance requirements, could have a material adverse effect on our business, including our financial condition, operating results, and reputation.
Interruptions or performance problems associated with our technology and infrastructure, and our reliance on technologies from third parties, may adversely affect our business operations and financial results.
We rely on third-party cloud platforms to host our cloud offerings. If we experience an interruption in service for any reason, our cloud offerings would similarly be interrupted. An interruption in our services to our customers could cause our customers’ internal and consumer-facing applications to not function properly, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, customer relationships and reputation.
In addition, our website and internal technology infrastructure may experience performance issues due to a variety of factors, including infrastructure changes, human or software errors, website or third-party hosting disruptions, capacity constraints, technical failures, natural disasters or fraud or security attacks. Our use of third-party open source software may increase this risk. If our website is unavailable or our users are unable to download our products or order subscriptions or services within a reasonable amount of time or at all, our business could be harmed. We expect to continue to make significant investments to maintain and improve website performance and to enable rapid releases of new features and applications for our products. To the extent that we do not effectively upgrade our systems as needed and continually develop our technology to accommodate actual and anticipated changes in technology, our business and results of operations may be harmed.
We rely on third-party service providers for many aspects of our business, and any failure to maintain these relationships could harm our business.
Our success depends upon our relationships with third-party service providers, including providers of cloud hosting infrastructure, customer relationship management systems, financial reporting systems, human resource management systems, credit card processing platforms, marketing automation systems, and payroll processing systems, among others. If any of these third parties experience difficulty meeting our requirements or standards, become unavailable due to extended outages or interruptions, temporarily or permanently cease operations, face financial distress or other business disruptions, increase their fees, if our relationships with any of these providers deteriorate, or if any of the agreements we have entered into with such third parties are terminated or not renewed without adequate transition arrangements, we could suffer liabilities, penalties, fines, increased costs and delays in our ability to provide customers with our products and services, our ability to manage our finances could be interrupted, receipt of payments from customers may be delayed, our processes for managing sales of our offerings could be impaired, our ability to generate and manage sales leads could be weakened, or our business operations could be disrupted. Any of such disruptions may adversely impact our business and our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows could be adversely affected until we replace such providers or develop replacement technology or operations. In addition, if we are unsuccessful in identifying high-quality service providers, negotiating cost-effective relationships with them or effectively managing these relationships, it could adversely affect our business and financial results.
The length of our sales cycle can be unpredictable, particularly with respect to sales through our channel partners or sales to large customers, and our sales efforts may require considerable time and expense.
Our results of operations may fluctuate, in part, because of the length and variability of the sales cycle of our subscriptions and the difficulty in making short-term adjustments to our operating expenses. Our results of operations depend in part on sales to new customers, including large customers, and increasing sales to existing customers. The length of our sales cycle, from initial contact with our sales team to contractually committing to our subscriptions can vary substantially from customer to customer based on deal complexity as well as whether a sale is made directly by us or through a channel partner. Our sales cycle can extend to more than a year for some customers, and the length of sales cycles may be further impacted due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Some customers have been scrutinizing their spending more carefully given a challenging economic environment associated with the pandemic, and we generally expect this to continue. This might cause sales cycles to become longer or become more unpredictable. As we target more of our sales efforts at larger enterprise customers, we may face greater costs, longer sales cycles, greater competition and less predictability in completing some of our sales. A customer’s decision to use our solutions may be an enterprise-wide decision, which may require greater levels of education regarding the use cases of our products or prolonged negotiations. In addition, larger customers may demand more configuration, integration services and features. It is difficult to predict exactly when, or even if, we will make a sale to a potential customer or if we can increase sales to our existing customers. As a result, large individual sales have, in some cases, occurred in quarters subsequent to those we anticipated, or have not occurred at all. The loss or delay of one or more large transactions in a quarter could affect our cash flows and results of operations for that quarter and for future quarters. Because a substantial proportion of our expenses are relatively fixed in the short term, our cash flows and results of operations will suffer if revenue falls below our expectations in a particular quarter, which could cause the price of our ordinary shares to decline.
We depend on our senior management and other key employees, and the loss of one or more of these employees or an inability to attract and retain highly skilled employees could harm our business.
Our future success depends, in part, on our ability to continue to attract and retain highly skilled personnel. The loss of the services of any of our key personnel, the inability to attract or retain qualified personnel, or delays in hiring required personnel, particularly in engineering and sales, may seriously harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Further, our ability to attract additional qualified personnel may be impacted by the economic uncertainty and insecurity caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The loss of services of any of our key personnel also increases our dependency on other key personnel who remain with us. Although we have entered into employment offer letters with our key personnel, their employment is for no specific duration and constitutes at-will employment. We are also substantially dependent on the continued service of our existing engineering personnel because of the complexity of our products.
Our future performance also depends on the continued services and continuing contributions of our senior management, particularly our Chief Executive Officer and Chairman, Shay Banon, to execute on our business plan and to identify and pursue new opportunities and product innovations. We do not maintain key person life insurance policies on any of our employees. The loss of services of senior management could significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our development and strategic objectives, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Any search for senior management in the future or any search to replace the loss of any senior management may be prolonged, and we may not be able to attract a qualified candidate or replacement, as applicable, in a timely manner or at all, particularly as potential candidates may be wary to transition during the unstable economic conditions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic could make it more difficult to onboard, provide training to and integrate any senior
management or key employees, which could adversely affect their productivity and our business. If we are unable to mitigate these or other similar risks as we experience management turnover, our business, results of operation and financial condition may be adversely affected.
Additionally, the industry in which we operate is generally characterized by significant competition for skilled personnel as well as high employee attrition. We may not be successful in attracting, integrating, or retaining qualified personnel to fulfill our current or future needs. We may need to invest significant amounts of cash and equity to attract and retain new employees, and we may never realize returns on these investments. Also, to the extent we hire personnel from competitors, we may be subject to allegations that they have been improperly solicited, that they have divulged proprietary or other confidential information, or that their former employers own their inventions or other work product.
If we are not able to maintain and enhance our brand, especially among developers, our ability to expand our customer base will be impaired and our business and operating results may be adversely affected.
We believe that developing and maintaining widespread awareness of our brand, especially with developers, is critical to achieving widespread acceptance of our software and attracting new users and customers. We also believe that the importance of brand recognition will increase as competition in our market increases. Successfully maintaining and enhancing our brand will depend largely on the effectiveness of our marketing efforts, our ability to maintain our customers’ trust, our ability to continue to develop new functionality and use cases, and our ability to successfully differentiate our products and platform capability from competitive products. Brand promotion activities may not generate user or customer awareness or increase revenue, and even if they do, any increase in revenue may not offset the expenses we incur in building our brand. For instance, our continued focus and investment in ElasticON and similar investments in our brand, user engagement, and customer engagement may not generate the desired customer awareness or a sufficient financial return. If we fail to successfully promote and maintain our brand, we may fail to attract or retain users and customers necessary to realize a sufficient return on our brand-building efforts, or to achieve the widespread brand awareness that is critical for broad customer adoption of our products, which would adversely affect our business and results of operations.
Our corporate culture has contributed to our success, and if we cannot maintain this culture as we grow, we could lose the innovation, creativity and entrepreneurial spirit we have worked to foster, which could harm our business.
We believe that our culture has been and will continue to be a key contributor to our success. We expect to continue to hire as we expand. If we do not continue to maintain our corporate culture as we grow, we may be unable to foster the innovation, creativity, and entrepreneurial spirit we believe we need to support our growth. Moreover, many of our existing employees may be able to receive significant proceeds from sales of our ordinary shares in the public markets, which could lead to employee attrition and disparities of wealth among our employees that adversely affects relations among employees and our culture in general. Additional headcount growth may result in a change to our corporate culture, which could harm our business.
We rely on channel partners to execute a portion of our sales; if our channel partners fail to perform or we are unable to maintain successful relationships with our channel partners, our ability to market, sell and distribute our solution will be more limited, and our results of operations could be harmed.
A portion of our revenue is generated by sales through our channel partners, especially to U.S. federal government customers and in certain international markets, and these sales may grow and represent a larger portion of our revenues in the future. We provide certain of our channel partners with specific training and programs to assist them in selling our offerings, but there can be no assurance that these steps will be effective. In addition, our channel partners may be unsuccessful in marketing and selling our offerings, particularly in light of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. If we are unable to develop and maintain effective sales incentive programs for our channel partners, we may not be able to incentivize these partners to sell our offerings to customers.
Some of these partners may also market, sell, and support offerings that compete with ours, may devote more resources to the marketing, sales, and support of such competitive offerings, may have incentives to promote our competitors’ offerings to the detriment of our own or may cease selling our offerings altogether. Our agreements with our channel partners typically have a duration of one to three years, and generally may be terminated for any reason by either party with advance notice prior to each renewal date. We may not be able to retain these channel partners or secure additional or replacement channel partners. The loss of one or more of our significant channel partners or a decline in the number or size of orders from any of them could harm our results of operations. In addition, many of our new channel partners require extensive training and may take several months or more to achieve productivity. Our channel partner sales structure could subject us to lawsuits, potential liability, and reputational harm if, for example, any of our channel partners misrepresents the functionality of our offerings to customers or violates laws or our or their corporate policies. If our channel partners are unsuccessful in fulfilling the orders for our offerings, or if we are unable to enter into arrangements with and retain high quality channel partners, our ability to sell our offerings and results of operations could be harmed.
If we are unable to maintain successful relationships with our partners, our business operations, financial results and growth prospects could be adversely affected.
We maintain partnership relationships with a variety of partners, including cloud providers, systems integrators, channel partners, referral partners, OEM and MSP partners, and technology partners, to deliver offerings to our end customers and complement our broad community of users. In particular, we partner with various cloud providers to jointly market, sell and deliver our Elastic Cloud offerings, and in some instances this also involves technical integration with such cloud providers.
Our agreements with our partners are generally non-exclusive, meaning our partners may offer customers the offerings of several different companies, including offerings that compete with ours, or may themselves be or become competitors. If our partners do not effectively market and sell our offerings, choose to use greater efforts to market and sell their own offerings or those of our competitors, fail to meet the needs of our customers, or fail to deliver professional services to our customers particularly in light of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, our ability to grow our business and sell our offerings may be harmed. Our partners may cease marketing our offerings with limited or no notice and with little or no penalty. The loss of a substantial number of our partners, our possible inability to replace them, or the failure to recruit additional partners could harm our results of operations.
Our ability to achieve revenue growth in the future will depend in part on our success in maintaining successful relationships with our partners and in helping our partners enhance their ability to market and sell our subscriptions. If we are unable to maintain our relationships with these partners, our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows could be harmed.
The sales prices of our offerings may decrease, which may reduce our gross profits and adversely affect our financial results.
The sales prices for our offerings may decline or we may introduce new pricing models for a variety of reasons, including competitive pricing pressures, discounts, in anticipation of or in conjunction with the introduction of new offerings, or promotional programs. Competition continues to increase in the market segments in which we operate, and we expect competition to further increase in the future, thereby leading to increased pricing pressures. Larger competitors with more diverse offerings may reduce the price of offerings that compete with ours or may bundle them with other offerings. Additionally, currency fluctuations in certain countries and regions may negatively impact actual prices that customers and channel partners are willing to pay in those countries and regions. Any decrease in the sales prices for our offerings, without a corresponding decrease in costs or increase in volume, would adversely impact our gross profit. Gross profit could also be adversely impacted by a shift in the mix of our subscriptions from self-managed to our cloud offering, for which we incur hosting costs, as well as any increase in our mix of professional services relative to subscriptions. We may not be able to maintain our prices and gross profits at levels that will allow us to achieve and maintain profitability.
We expect our revenue mix to vary over time, which could harm our gross margin and operating results.
We expect our revenue mix to vary over time due to a number of factors, and we expect that revenue from Elastic Cloud will continue to become a larger part of our revenue mix. Due to the differing revenue recognition policies applicable to our subscriptions and professional services, shifts in our business mix from quarter to quarter could produce substantial variation in revenue recognized. Further, our gross margins and operating results could be harmed by changes in revenue mix and costs, together with numerous other factors, including entry into new markets or growth in lower margin markets; entry into markets with different pricing and cost structures; pricing discounts; and increased price competition. Any one of these factors or the cumulative effects of certain of these factors may result in significant fluctuations in our gross margin and operating results. This variability and unpredictability could result in our failure to meet internal expectations or those of securities analysts or investors for a particular period. If we fail to meet or exceed such expectations for these or any other reasons, the market price of our ordinary shares could decline.
Failure to protect our proprietary technology and intellectual property rights could substantially harm our business and results of operations.
Our success depends to a significant degree on our ability to protect our proprietary technology, methodologies, know-how and brand. We rely on a combination of trademarks, copyrights, patents, contractual restrictions, and other intellectual property laws and confidentiality procedures to establish and protect our proprietary rights. However, the steps we take to protect our intellectual property rights may be inadequate. We will not be able to protect our intellectual property rights if we are unable to enforce our rights or if we do not detect unauthorized use of our intellectual property rights. The source code of the proprietary features for the Elastic Stack is publicly available, which may enable others to replicate our proprietary technology and compete more effectively. If we fail to protect our intellectual property rights adequately, our competitors may gain access to our proprietary technology and our business may be harmed. In addition, defending our intellectual property rights might entail significant expense. Any patents, trademarks, or other intellectual property rights that we have or may obtain
may be challenged by others or invalidated through administrative process or litigation. As of April 30, 2021, we had 24 issued U.S. patents, 57 pending U.S. patent applications, and 17 pending non-U.S. filings. There can be no assurance that our patent applications will result in issued patents. Even if we continue to seek patent protection in the future, we may be unable to obtain further patent protection for our technology. In addition, any patents issued in the future may not provide us with competitive advantages, or may be successfully challenged by third parties. Furthermore, legal standards relating to the validity, enforceability, and scope of protection of intellectual property rights are uncertain. Despite our precautions, it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy our products and use information that we regard as proprietary to create offerings that compete with ours. Effective patent, trademark, copyright, and trade secret protection may not be available to us in every country in which our products are available. We may be unable to prevent third parties from acquiring domain names or trademarks that are similar to, infringe upon, or diminish the value of our trademarks and other proprietary rights. The laws of some countries may not be as protective of intellectual property rights as those in the United States, and mechanisms for enforcement of intellectual property rights may be inadequate. As we expand our international activities, our exposure to unauthorized copying and use of our products and proprietary information will likely increase. Accordingly, despite our efforts, we may be unable to prevent third parties from infringing upon or misappropriating our intellectual property.
We enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and consultants and enter into confidentiality agreements with other parties. No assurance can be given that these agreements will be effective in controlling access to and distribution of our proprietary information. Further, these agreements may not prevent our competitors from independently developing technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our products.
In order to protect our intellectual property rights, we may be required to spend significant resources to monitor and protect our intellectual property rights. Litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights and to protect our trade secrets. For example, on September 4, 2019, we filed suit against floragunn GmbH in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California for copyright infringement and contributory copyright infringement, and on September 27, 2019, we filed a suit against Amazon.com, Inc. in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California for trademark infringement and false advertising. Litigation brought to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights could be costly, time-consuming, and distracting to management, and could result in the impairment or loss of portions of our intellectual property. Further, our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights may be met with defenses, counterclaims, and countersuits attacking the validity and enforceability of our intellectual property rights. Our inability to protect our proprietary technology against unauthorized copying or use, as well as any costly litigation or diversion of our management’s attention and resources, could delay further sales or the implementation of our products, impair the functionality of our products, delay introductions of new products, result in our substituting inferior or more costly technologies into our products, or injure our reputation.
We could incur substantial costs as a result of any claim of infringement, misappropriation or violation of another party’s intellectual property rights.
In recent years, there has been significant litigation involving patents and other intellectual property rights in the software industry. Companies providing software are increasingly bringing and becoming subject to suits alleging infringement, misappropriation or violation of proprietary rights, particularly patent rights, and to the extent we gain greater market visibility, we face a higher risk of being the subject of intellectual property infringement, misappropriation or violation claims. We do not currently have a large patent portfolio, which could prevent us from deterring patent infringement claims through our own patent portfolio, and our competitors and others may now and in the future have significantly larger and more mature patent portfolios than we have. The risk of patent litigation has been amplified by the increase in the number of a type of patent holder, which we refer to as a non-practicing entity, whose sole or principal business is to assert such claims and against whom our own intellectual property portfolio may provide little deterrent value. We could incur substantial costs in prosecuting or defending any intellectual property litigation. If we sue to enforce our rights or are sued by a third party that claims that our products infringe, misappropriate or violate their rights, the litigation could be expensive and could divert our management resources.
Any intellectual property litigation to which we might become a party, or for which we are required to provide indemnification, may require us to do one or more of the following:
•cease selling or using products that incorporate the intellectual property rights that we allegedly infringe, misappropriate or violate;
•make substantial payments for legal fees, settlement payments or other costs or damages;
•obtain a license, which may not be available on reasonable terms or at all, to sell or use the relevant technology; or
•redesign the allegedly infringing products to avoid infringement, misappropriation or violation, which could be costly, time-consuming or impossible.
If we are required to make substantial payments or undertake any of the other actions noted above as a result of any intellectual property infringement, misappropriation or violation claims against us or any obligation to indemnify our customers for such claims, such payments or actions could harm our business.
Indemnity provisions in various agreements potentially expose us to substantial liability for intellectual property infringement, misappropriation, violation and other losses.
Our agreements with customers and other third parties may include indemnification provisions under which we agree to indemnify them for losses suffered or incurred as a result of claims of intellectual property infringement, misappropriation or violation, damages caused by us to property or persons, or other liabilities relating to or arising from our software, services or other contractual obligations. Large indemnity payments could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. Although we normally contractually limit our liability with respect to such indemnity obligations, we may still incur substantial liability related to them. Any dispute with a customer with respect to such obligations could have adverse effects on our relationship with that customer and other existing customers and new customers and harm our business and results of operations.
Our use of third-party open source software within our products could negatively affect our ability to sell our products and subject us to possible litigation.
Our technologies incorporate open source software from other developers, and we expect to continue to incorporate such open source software in our products in the future. Few of the licenses applicable to open source software have been interpreted by courts, and there is a risk that these licenses could be construed in a manner that could impose unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize our products. Moreover, we cannot assure that we have not incorporated third-party open source software in our software in a manner that is inconsistent with the terms of the applicable license or our current policies and procedures. If we fail to comply with these licenses, we may be subject to certain requirements, including requirements that we offer our solutions that incorporate the open source software for no cost, that we make available source code for modifications or derivative works we create based upon, incorporating or using the open source software and that we license such modifications or derivative works under the terms of applicable open source licenses. If an author or other third party that distributes such open source software were to allege that we had not complied with the conditions of one or more of these licenses, we could be required to incur significant legal expenses defending against such allegations and could be subject to significant damages, enjoined from the sale of our products that contained the open source software and required to comply with onerous conditions or restrictions on these products, which could disrupt the distribution and sale of these products. In addition, there have been claims challenging the ownership rights in open source software against companies that incorporate open source software into their products, and the licensors of such open source software provide no warranties or indemnities with respect to such claims. In any of these events, we and our customers could be required to seek licenses from third parties in order to continue offering our products, and to re-engineer our products or discontinue the sale of our products in the event re-engineering cannot be accomplished on a timely basis. We and our customers may also be subject to suits by parties claiming infringement, misappropriation or violation due to the reliance by our solutions on certain open source software, and such litigation could be costly for us to defend or subject us to an injunction. Some open source projects have known vulnerabilities and architectural instabilities and as provided on an “as-is” basis which, if not properly addressed, could negatively affect the performance of our product. Any of the foregoing could require us to devote additional research and development resources to re-engineer our solutions, could result in customer dissatisfaction, and may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
One of our marketing strategies is to offer some of our product features for free and to provide free trials of some of our paid features, and we may not be able to realize the benefits of this strategy.
We are dependent upon lead generation strategies, including offering free use of some of our product features and free trials of some of our paid features. These strategies may not be successful in continuing to generate sufficient sales opportunities necessary to increase our revenue. Many users never convert from the free use model or from free trials to the paid versions of our products. To the extent that users do not become, or we are unable to successfully attract, paying customers, we will not realize the intended benefits of these marketing strategies and our ability to grow our revenue will be adversely affected.
With the acquisition of Endgame, we face risks related to the integration of combined businesses, our cash resources and financial results, undisclosed liabilities, and employee and customer retention.
Since the closing of the acquisition of Endgame in October 2019, we have devoted significant management attention and resources to integrating the business practices and operations of the former Endgame business with our business. Potential difficulties we may encounter as we continue to integrate Endgame into our business strategy include those related to the costs
of integration and compliance, diversion of management’s attention, our ability to create and enforce uniform standards, procedures, policies and information systems, potential unknown liabilities, and unforeseen increased expenses or delays.
Our due diligence review in connection with the acquisition may not have discovered undisclosed liabilities of Endgame. If there are undisclosed liabilities, Elastic as a successor owner may be responsible for such undisclosed liabilities. Such undisclosed liabilities could have an adverse effect on the business and results of operations and may adversely affect the value of our ordinary shares.
The acquisition may also result in significant charges or other liabilities that could adversely affect our results of operations, such as cash expenses and non-cash accounting charges incurred in connection with the acquisition and/or integration of the combined businesses and operations.
Our international operations and expansion expose us to several risks.
As of April 30, 2021, we had customers located in over 100 countries, and our strategy is to continue to expand internationally. In addition, as a result of our strategy of leveraging a distributed workforce, as of April 30, 2021, we had employees located in over 35 countries. Our current international operations involve and future initiatives may involve a variety of risks, including:
•unexpected changes in regulatory requirements, taxes, trade laws, tariffs, export quotas, custom duties or other trade restrictions;
•different labor regulations, especially in the European Union, where labor laws are generally more advantageous to employees as compared to the United States, including deemed hourly wage and overtime regulations in these locations;
•exposure to many stringent, particularly in the European Union, and potentially inconsistent laws and regulations relating to privacy, data protection and information security;
•changes in a specific country’s or region’s political or economic conditions;
•political, economic and trade uncertainties or instability related to the effect of the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union (Brexit), including the effects of the Trade and Cooperation Agreement between the European Union, the European Atomic Energy Community and the United Kingdom signed in December 2020, on the economies of, and the relationships between, the United Kingdom, European Union, United States and other countries;
•the evolving relations between the United States and China;
•changes in relations between the Netherlands and the United States;
•risks resulting from changes in currency exchange rates and inflation;
•the impact of public health epidemics or pandemics on our employees, partners and customers;
•challenges inherent to efficiently managing an increased number of employees over large geographic distances, including the need to implement appropriate systems, policies, benefits and compliance programs;
•risks relating to the implementation of trade and economic sanctions, including restrictions promulgated by the OFAC, and other similar trade protection regulations and measures in the United States or in other jurisdictions;
•risks relating to our third-party vendors and service providers’ storage and processing of some of our and our customers’ data, including any supply chain cyber attacks;
•reduced ability to timely collect amounts owed to us by our customers in countries where our recourse may be more limited;
•limitations on our ability to reinvest earnings from operations derived from one country to fund the capital needs of our operations in other countries;
•limited or unfavorable intellectual property protection; and
•exposure to liabilities under anti-corruption and anti-money laundering laws, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended (“FCPA”), and similar applicable laws and regulations in other jurisdictions.
If we are unable to address these difficulties and challenges or other problems encountered in connection with our international operations and expansion, we might incur unanticipated liabilities or we might otherwise suffer harm to our business generally.
If we are not successful in sustaining and expanding our international business, we may incur additional losses and our revenue growth could be harmed.
Our future results depend, in part, on our ability to sustain and expand our penetration of the international markets in which we currently operate and to expand into additional international markets. We depend on direct sales and our channel partner relationships to sell our offerings in international markets. Our ability to expand internationally will depend upon our ability to deliver functionality and foreign language translations that reflect the needs of the international clients that we target. Our ability to expand internationally involves various risks, including the need to invest significant resources in such expansion, and the possibility that returns on such investments will not be achieved in the near future or at all in these less familiar competitive environments. We may also choose to conduct our international business through other partnerships. If we are unable to identify partners or negotiate favorable terms, our international growth may be limited. In addition, we have incurred and may continue to incur significant expenses in advance of generating material revenue as we attempt to establish our presence in particular international markets.
If we need to raise additional capital or generate the significant capital necessary to expand our operations and invest in new offerings, it could reduce our ability to compete and could harm our business.
We may need to raise additional funds in the future, and we may not be able to obtain additional debt or equity financing on favorable terms, if at all. If we raise additional equity financing, our shareholders may experience significant dilution of their ownership interests and the per share value of our ordinary shares could decline. Furthermore, if we engage in debt financing, the holders of debt would have priority over the holders of our ordinary shares, and we may be required to accept terms that restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness. We may also be required to take other actions that would otherwise be in the interests of the debt holders and force us to maintain specified liquidity or other ratios, any of which could harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition. If we need additional capital and cannot raise it on acceptable terms, we may not be able to, among other things:
•develop or enhance our products;
•continue to expand our sales and marketing and research and development organizations;
•acquire complementary technologies, products or businesses;
•expand operations in the United States or internationally;
•hire, train, and retain employees; or
•respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated working capital requirements.
Our failure to have sufficient capital to do any of these things could harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
A portion of our revenue is generated by sales to government entities, which are subject to a number of challenges and risks.
Sales to government entities are subject to a number of risks. Selling to government entities can be highly competitive, expensive, and time-consuming, often requiring significant upfront time and expense without any assurance that these efforts will generate a sale. Government certification requirements for products like ours may change, thereby restricting our ability to sell into the U.S. federal government sector, U.S. state government sector, or government sectors of countries other than the United States until we have attained the revised certification. For example, we hold a U.S. Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program Authority to Operate at a moderate impact level; however, such authority is costly to maintain and if we were to lose our certification in the future, it would restrict our ability to sell to government customers. On May 12, 2021, the Biden Administration issued an Executive Order that will ultimately result in additional security requirements for government agencies and their contractors, for example, multifactor authentication, encryption for data at rest and in transit, and broad log creation, preservation, and production requirements. Furthermore, the Executive Order accelerates agency planning and implementation requirements for “zero trust architecture” and will establish a standards-development effort for a software bill of materials. This may increase compliance costs directly for government contracts and indirectly to the extent such requirements require changes or new efforts at an enterprise level. If we are unable to timely meet such requirements, our ability to compete for and maintain federal government contracts may be diminished, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
Government demand and payment for our offerings may be affected by public sector budgetary cycles and funding authorizations, with funding reductions or delays adversely affecting public sector demand for our offerings. Sales to government agencies, including classified contracts, are subject to complex regulations. Failure to comply with such regulations could result in contract terminations or other adverse consequences, including but not limited to adversely affecting our eligibility to sell to government agencies in the future. Additionally, we rely on certain partners to provide technical support
services to certain of our government entity customers to resolve any issues relating to our products. If our partners do not effectively assist our government entity customers in deploying our products, succeed in helping our government entity customers quickly resolve post-deployment issues, or provide effective ongoing support, our ability to sell additional offerings to new and existing government entity customers would be adversely affected and our reputation could be damaged.
Government entities may have statutory, contractual, or other legal rights to terminate contracts with us or our channel partners for convenience or due to a default, and any such termination may adversely affect our future results of operations. In addition, multi-year contracts with government entities are usually conditioned on annual fiscal funding actions that the relevant legislative or other decision-making body must take in order to fund each year of a contract. Such legislative or decision-making bodies may elect not to fund each year of a contract. Governments routinely investigate and audit government contractors’ administrative processes, and any unfavorable audit could result in the government refusing to continue buying our subscriptions, a reduction of revenue, or fines or civil or criminal liability if the audit uncovers improper or illegal activities, which could adversely affect our results of operations in a material way.
Unanticipated changes in effective tax rates or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our income or other tax returns could expose us to greater than anticipated tax liabilities.
Our income tax obligations are based in part on our corporate structure and intercompany arrangements, including the manner in which we develop, value, and use our intellectual property and the valuations of our intercompany transactions. The tax laws applicable to our business, including the laws of the Netherlands, the United States and other jurisdictions, are subject to change and interpretation, and certain jurisdictions may aggressively interpret their laws in an effort to raise additional tax revenue. For example, recently, in the United States, the Biden administration has proposed a number of changes, including an increase to the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 21% to 28%. In addition, other countries, as well as organizations such as the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, have recently proposed or recommended changes to existing tax laws or have enacted new laws that could impact our tax obligations in countries where we do business or cause us to change the way we operate our business. Any new legislation or interpretations of existing legislation could result in increased taxation of our international earnings.
The taxing authorities of the jurisdictions in which we operate may challenge our methodologies for valuing developed technology or intercompany arrangements, which could increase our worldwide effective tax rate and harm our financial position and results of operations. Tax authorities examine and may audit our income tax returns and other non-income tax returns, such as payroll, sales, value-added, net worth or franchise, property, goods and services, and excise taxes, in both the United States and foreign jurisdictions. It is possible that tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken, and any adverse outcome of such a review or audit could have a negative effect on our financial position and results of operations. Further, the determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires significant judgment by management, and there are transactions where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Although we believe that our estimates are reasonable, the ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements and may materially affect our financial results in the period or periods for which such determination is made.
Our corporate structure and intercompany arrangements are subject to the tax laws of various jurisdictions, and we could be obligated to pay additional taxes, which would harm our results of operations.
Based on our current corporate structure, we may be subject to taxation in several jurisdictions around the world with increasingly complex tax laws, the application of which can be uncertain. The amount of taxes we pay in these jurisdictions could increase substantially as a result of changes in the applicable tax principles, including increased tax rates, new tax laws or revised interpretations of existing tax laws and precedents. In addition, the authorities in the jurisdictions in which we operate could review our tax returns or require us to file tax returns in jurisdictions in which we are not currently filing, and could impose additional tax, interest and penalties. These authorities could also claim that various withholding requirements apply to us or our subsidiaries, assert that benefits of tax treaties are not available to us or our subsidiaries, or challenge our methodologies for valuing developed technology or intercompany arrangements, including our transfer pricing. The relevant taxing authorities may determine that the manner in which we operate our business does not achieve the intended tax consequences. If such a disagreement was to occur, and our position was not sustained, we could be required to pay additional taxes, and interest and penalties. Any increase in the amount of taxes we pay or that are imposed on us could increase our worldwide effective tax rate and harm our business and results of operations.
Our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards to offset future taxable income may be subject to certain limitations.
As of April 30, 2021 and 2020, we had net operating loss carryforwards in various jurisdictions of $2.2 billion and $1.3 billion, respectively, which may be utilized against future income taxes. Limitations imposed by the applicable jurisdictions on our ability to utilize net operating loss carryforwards could cause income taxes to be paid earlier than would be paid if such limitations were not in effect and could cause such net operating loss carryforwards to expire unused, in each case
reducing or eliminating the benefit of such net operating loss carryforwards. Furthermore, we may not be able to generate sufficient taxable income to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards before they expire. If any of these events occur, we may not derive some or all of the expected benefits from our net operating loss carryforwards.
We are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, which could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations.
A portion of our subscriptions are generated and operating expenses are incurred outside the United States and denominated in foreign currencies and are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly against the Euro. In part as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, foreign currency exchange rates have been and could continue to be subject to increased volatility. The strengthening of the U.S. dollar increases the real cost of our offerings to our customers outside of the United States, leading to delays in the purchase of our offerings and the lengthening of our sales cycle. If the strength of the U.S. dollar increases, this could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, increased international sales in the future, including through our channel partners, may result in greater foreign currency denominated sales, increasing our foreign currency risk. Moreover, operating expenses incurred outside the United States and denominated in foreign currencies are increasing and are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. If we are not able to successfully hedge against the risks associated with currency fluctuations, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. To date, we have not entered into any hedging transactions in an effort to reduce our exposure to foreign currency exchange risk. While we may decide to enter into hedging transactions in the future, the availability and effectiveness of these hedging transactions may be limited and we may not be able to successfully hedge our exposure, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
Seasonality may cause fluctuations in our sales and results of operations.
Historically, we have experienced quarterly fluctuations and seasonality based on the timing of entering into agreements with new and existing customers and the mix between annual and monthly contracts entered in each reporting period. Trends in our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows are impacted by seasonality in our sales cycle which generally reflects a trend to greater sales in our second and fourth quarters and lower sales in our first and third quarters, though we believe this trend has been somewhat masked by our overall growth. We expect that this seasonality will continue to affect our results of operations in the future, and might become more pronounced as we continue to target larger enterprise customers.
Risks Related to Regulatory Matters
In connection with the operation of our business, we may collect, store, transfer and otherwise process certain personal data. As a result, our business is subject to a variety of government and industry regulations, as well as other obligations, related to privacy, data protection and information security.
Privacy, data protection and information security have become significant issues in various jurisdictions where we offer our products. The regulatory frameworks for these issues worldwide are rapidly evolving and are likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future. Federal, state, or non-U.S. government bodies or agencies have in the past adopted, and may in the future adopt, new laws and regulations or may make amendments to existing laws and regulations affecting data protection, data privacy and/or information security and/or regulating the use of the Internet as a commercial medium. For example, the recently enacted California Consumer Privacy Act (the “CCPA”) provides new data privacy rights for California residents. The enforcement of the CCPA by the California Attorney General commenced July 1, 2020. We cannot fully predict the impact of the CCPA on our business or operations, but we may be required to modify our data processing practices and policies and to incur substantial costs and expenses in connection with our compliance or the compliance of our customers or vendors. The CCPA also provides for civil penalties and a private right of action for violations, which may increase our compliance costs and potential liability. Additionally, a new privacy law, the California Privacy Rights Act (“CPRA”), was approved by California voters in the November 3, 2020 election. The CPRA creates obligations relating to consumer data beginning on January 1, 2022, with implementing regulations expected on or before July 1, 2022, and enforcement beginning July 1, 2023. We will continue to monitor developments related to the CPRA and anticipate additional costs and expenses associated with CPRA compliance. Other U.S. states also are considering omnibus privacy legislation and industry organizations regularly adopt and advocate for new standards in these areas. Many obligations under the CCPA and these other laws and legislative proposals remain uncertain, and we cannot fully predict their impact on our business. If we fail to comply with any of these laws or standards, we may be subject to investigations, enforcement actions, civil litigation, fines and other penalties, all of which may generate negative publicity and have a negative impact on our business.
Additionally, in the United States, we may be subject to investigation and/or enforcement actions brought by federal agencies and state attorneys general and consumer protection agencies. We publicly post statements and other documentation
regarding our practices concerning the processing, use and disclosure of personally identifiable information. Although we endeavor to comply with our published statements and documentation, we may at times fail to do so or be alleged to have failed to do so. The publication of our privacy statement and other documentation that provide promises and assurances about privacy and security can subject us to potential state and federal action if they are found to be deceptive, unfair, or misrepresentative of our actual practices.
Internationally, most jurisdictions in which we operate have established their own privacy, data protection and information security legal frameworks with which we or our customers must comply. Within the European Union, the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) became fully effective on May 25, 2018, and applies to the processing (which includes the collection and use) of personal data. The GDPR imposes significant obligations and risk upon our business and provides for substantial penalties to which we could be subject in the event of any non-compliance. Administrative fines under the GDPR can amount up to 20 million Euros or four percent of the group’s annual global turnover, whichever is higher. Further, the United Kingdom has implemented legislation that substantially implements the GDPR in the United Kingdom, which legislation provides for penalties for violations of up to the greater of 17.5 million British pounds or four percent of the group’s annual global turnover. Following the exit of the United Kingdom from the European Union however, aspects of U.K. data protection law and the relationship of the United Kingdom and the European Union in the medium to longer term remain unclear, including with respect to how data transfers to and from the United Kingdom will be regulated.
We have incurred substantial expense in complying with new data protection legal frameworks and we may be required to make additional, significant changes in our business operations, all of which may adversely affect our revenue and our business overall. Additionally, because these new regimes lack a substantial enforcement history, we are unable to predict how emerging standards may be applied to us. Despite our efforts to attempt to comply with new data protection obligations, a regulator may determine that we have not done so and subject us to fines and public censure, which could harm our company.
Among other requirements, the GDPR regulates transfers of personal data subject to the GDPR to third countries that have not been found to provide adequate protection to such personal data, including the United States. Some countries also are considering or have passed legislation requiring local storage and processing of data, or similar requirements, which could increase the cost and complexity of delivering our services. We have undertaken certain efforts to conform transfers of personal data from the European Economic Area (“EEA”), to the United States and other jurisdictions based on our understanding of current regulatory obligations and the guidance of data protection authorities, including standard contractual clauses approved by the European Commission (the “SCCs”). Despite this, we may be unsuccessful in maintaining conforming means of transferring such data from the EEA, in particular as a result of continued legal and legislative activity within the EEA that has challenged or called into question existing means of data transfers to countries that have not been found to provide adequate protection for personal data.
The regulatory environment applicable to handling of EEA residents' personal data, and our actions taken in response, may cause us to assume additional liabilities or incur additional costs. In the Schrems II decision issued by the Court of Justice of the European Union (“CJEU”) on July 16, 2020, the CJEU, among other things, imposed additional obligations on companies when relying on the SCCs. We and our customers may face EEA regulators applying different standards to certain data transfers or requiring additional steps in connection with data transfers, and may be required to engage in new contract negotiations with third parties that aid in processing data on our behalf. We may be unsuccessful in maintaining legitimate means for our transfer and receipt of personal data from the EEA, and may experience hesitancy, reluctance, or refusal by European or multi-national customers to continue to use our products due to the potential risk exposure to such customers as a result of sentiment in the EEA regarding international data transfers and data protection obligations imposed on them. We may find it necessary to establish systems to maintain personal data originating from the EEA in the EEA, or may need to take other steps with respect to data handling and data transfers, including means to provide for local data processing, which may involve substantial expense and may require us to divert resources from other aspects of our business, all of which may adversely affect our business. We and our customers may face a risk of enforcement actions by European data protection authorities until the time, if any, that personal data transfers to us and by us from the EEA are legitimized under European law. These and the other risks described above could result in harm to our business, operating results and financial condition. In addition to government regulation, privacy advocates and industry groups may propose new and different self-regulatory standards that may legally or contractually apply to us. One example of such a self-regulatory standard is the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (“PCI DSS”), which relates to the processing of payment card information. In the event we or our payment processors fail to comply with the PCI DSS, fines and other penalties could result, and we may suffer reputational harm and damage to our business. Further, our customers increasingly expect us to comply with more stringent privacy, data protection and information security requirements than those imposed by laws, regulations or self-regulatory requirements, and we may be obligated contractually to comply with additional or different standards relating to our handling or protection of data on or by our offerings. Any failure to meet our customers’ requirements may adversely affect our revenues and prospects for growth.
We also expect that there will continue to be changes in interpretations of existing laws and regulations, or new proposed laws, regulations, and other obligations concerning privacy, data protection and information security, which could
impair our or our customers’ ability to collect, use or disclose information relating to consumers, which could decrease demand for our offerings, increase our costs and impair our ability to maintain and grow our customer base and increase our revenue. Because the interpretation and application of many laws and regulations relating to privacy, data protection and information security, along with industry standards, are uncertain, it is possible that these laws and regulations may be interpreted and applied in manners that are, or are alleged to be, inconsistent with our data management practices or the features of our products, and we could face fines, lawsuits, regulatory investigations and other claims and penalties, and we could be required to fundamentally change our products or our business practices, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business. Any inability to adequately address privacy, data protection and information security concerns, even if unfounded, or any actual or perceived failure to comply with applicable privacy, data protection or information security laws, regulations and other obligations, could result in additional cost and liability to us, damage our reputation, inhibit sales and adversely affect our business. Furthermore, the costs of compliance with, and other burdens imposed by, the laws, regulations and policies that are applicable to the businesses of our customers may limit the use and adoption of, and reduce the overall demand for, our products. Privacy, data protection and information security concerns, whether valid or not valid, may inhibit market adoption of our products, particularly in certain industries and countries outside of the United States. If we are not able to adjust to changing laws, regulations and standards related to the Internet, our business may be harmed.
We are subject to governmental export and import controls and economic sanctions programs that could impair our ability to compete in international markets or subject us to liability if we violate these controls.
Our software and services, in some cases, are subject to U.S. export control laws and regulations including the Export Administration Regulations (“EAR”), and trade and economic sanctions maintained by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”). As such, an export license may be required to export or reexport our software and services to certain countries and end-users for certain end-uses. If we were to fail to comply with such U.S. export controls laws and regulations, U.S. economic sanctions, or other similar laws, we could be subject to both civil and criminal penalties, including substantial fines, possible incarceration for employees and managers for willful violations, and the possible loss of our export or import privileges. Obtaining the necessary export license for a particular sale or offering may not be possible and may be time-consuming and may result in the delay or loss of sales opportunities. Furthermore, U.S. export control laws and economic sanctions in many cases prohibit the export of software and services to certain U.S. embargoed or sanctioned countries, governments and persons, as well as for prohibited end-uses. Monitoring and ensuring compliance with these complex U.S. export control laws is particularly challenging because our offerings are widely distributed throughout the world, and information available on the users of these offerings is, in some cases, limited. In addition, because we incorporate encryption functionality into our products, we are also subject to certain provisions of these laws that apply to encryption items. Even though we take precautions to ensure that we and our partners comply with all relevant export control laws and regulations, any failure by us or our partners to comply with such laws and regulations could have negative consequences for us, including reputational harm, government investigations and penalties.
In addition, various countries regulate the export and import of certain encryption software and technology, including through import permit and license requirements, and have enacted laws that could limit our ability to distribute our products and services or could limit our end-customers’ ability to implement our products in those countries. Changes in our products or changes in export and import regulations in such countries may create delays in the introduction of our products and services into international markets, prevent our end-customers with international operations from deploying our products globally or, in some cases, prevent or delay the export or import of our products and services to certain countries, governments or persons altogether. The following developments could result in decreased use of our products and services by, or in our decreased ability to export or sell our products to, existing or potential end-customers with international operations: any change in export or import laws or regulations, economic sanctions or related legislation; shift in the enforcement or scope of existing export, import or sanctions laws or regulations; or change in the countries, governments, persons, or technologies targeted by such export, import or sanctions laws or regulations. Any decreased use of our products or services or limitation on our ability to export to or sell our products or services in international markets could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.
Failure to comply with anti-bribery, anti-corruption, and anti-money laundering laws could subject us to penalties and other adverse consequences.
We are subject to the FCPA, the U.K. Bribery Act and other anti-corruption, anti-bribery and anti-money laundering laws in various jurisdictions both domestic and abroad. We leverage channel partners to sell our offerings abroad and use other third parties, including recruiting firms, professional employer organizations, legal, accounting and other professional advisors, and local vendors to meet our needs associated with doing business abroad. We and these third parties may have direct or indirect interactions with officials and employees of government agencies, or state-owned or affiliated entities, and we may be held liable for the corrupt or other illegal activities of our channel partners and third-party representatives, as well as our employees, representatives, contractors, partners, and agents, even if we do not explicitly authorize such activities. While we
have policies and procedures to address compliance with such laws, we cannot assure you that the channel partners, third-party representatives, our employees, contractors or agents will not take actions in violation of our policies and applicable law, for which we may be ultimately held responsible. Any violation of the FCPA, U.K. Bribery Act or other applicable anti-bribery, anti-corruption laws, and anti-money laundering laws could result in whistleblower complaints, adverse media coverage, investigations, loss of export privileges, severe criminal or civil sanctions, or suspension or debarment from U.S. government contracts, all of which may have an adverse effect on our reputation, business, operating results and prospects.
Risks Related to Ownership of our Ordinary Shares
The market price for our ordinary shares has been and is likely to continue to be volatile or may decline regardless of our operating performance.
The stock markets, and securities of technology companies in particular, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many technology companies. Stock prices of many technology companies have fluctuated in a manner unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. The economic impact and uncertainty of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic have exacerbated this volatility in both the overall stock markets and the market price of our ordinary shares. In the past, shareholders have instituted securities class action litigation following periods of market volatility. If we were to become involved in securities litigation, it could subject us to substantial costs, divert resources and the attention of management from our business and adversely affect our business. The market price of our ordinary shares may fluctuate significantly in response to numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control, including:
•actual or anticipated changes or fluctuations in our operating results;
•the financial projections we may provide to the public, any changes in these projections or our failure to meet these projections;
•announcements by us or our competitors of new offerings or new or terminated significant contracts, commercial relationships or capital commitments;
•industry or financial analyst or investor reaction to our press releases, other public announcements, and filings with the SEC;
•rumors and market speculation involving us or other companies in our industry;
•a gain or loss of investor confidence in the market for technology stocks or the stock market in general;
•future sales or expected future sales of our ordinary shares;
•investor perceptions of us, the benefits of our offerings and the industries in which we operate;
•price and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market from time to time;
•changes in operating performance and/or stock market valuations of other technology companies generally, or those in our industry in particular;
•failure of industry or financial analysts to maintain coverage of us, changes in financial estimates by any analysts who follow our company, or our failure to meet these estimates or the expectations of investors;
•actual or anticipated developments in our business or our competitors’ businesses or the competitive landscape generally;
•litigation involving us, our industry or both, or investigations by regulators into our operations or those of our competitors;
•developments or disputes concerning our intellectual property rights or our solutions, or third-party proprietary rights;
•announced or completed acquisitions of businesses or technologies by us or our competitors;
•breaches of, or failures relating to, privacy, data protection or information security;
•new laws or regulations or new interpretations of existing laws or regulations applicable to our business;
•any major changes in our management or our board of directors, particularly with respect to Mr. Banon;
•general economic conditions and slow or negative growth of our markets, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic; and
•other events or factors, including those resulting from war, incidents of terrorism or responses to these events.
We may fail to meet our publicly announced guidance or other expectations about our business and future operating results, which would cause our stock price to decline.
We have provided and may continue to provide guidance and other expectations in our quarterly and annual earnings conference calls, quarterly and annual earnings releases, or otherwise, regarding our future performance. Guidance, as well as other expectations, are forward-looking and represent our management’s estimates as of the date of release and are based upon a number of assumptions and estimates that, while presented with numerical specificity, are inherently subject to significant business, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies on our business, many of which are beyond our control and are based upon specific assumptions with respect to future business decisions, some of which will change. One of those key assumptions relates to the impact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and the associated economic uncertainty on our business, which is inherently difficult to predict. Furthermore, analysts and investors may develop and publish their own projections of our business, which may form a consensus about our future performance. Our actual business results may vary significantly from such guidance or other expectations or that consensus due to a number of factors, many of which are outside of our control, including due to the global economic uncertainty and financial market conditions caused by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, and which could adversely affect our business and future operating results. There are no comparable recent events that provide insights as to the probable effect of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, and, as a result, the ultimate impact of the COVID-19 outbreak is highly uncertain and subject to change. Furthermore, if we make downward revisions of our previously announced guidance or other expectations, if we withdraw our previously announced guidance or other expectations, or if our publicly announced guidance or other expectations of future operating results fail to meet expectations of securities analysts, investors or other interested parties, the price of our ordinary shares would decline. In light of the foregoing, investors are urged not to rely upon our guidance or other expectations in making an investment decision regarding our ordinary shares.
Any failure to successfully implement our operating strategy or the occurrence of any of the events or circumstances set forth in this “Risk Factors” section in this report could result in the actual operating results being different from our guidance or other expectations, and the differences may be adverse and material.
The concentration of our share ownership with insiders will likely limit your ability to influence corporate matters, including the ability to influence the outcome of director elections and other matters requiring shareholder approval.
Our executive officers and directors together beneficially owned 20.7% of our ordinary shares outstanding as of April 30, 2021. As a result, these shareholders, acting together, will have significant influence over matters that require approval by our shareholders, including matters such as adoption of the financial statements, declarations of dividends, the appointment and dismissal of directors, capital increases, amendment to our articles of association and approval of significant corporate transactions. Corporate action might be taken even if other shareholders oppose them. This concentration of ownership might also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of us that other shareholders may view as beneficial.
The issuance of additional shares in connection with financings, acquisitions, investments, our share incentive plans or otherwise will dilute all other shareholders.
Our articles of association authorize us to issue up to 165 million ordinary shares and up to 165 million preference shares with such rights and preferences as included in our articles of association. On September 28, 2018, our extraordinary general meeting of shareholders (the “2018 Extraordinary Meeting”) empowered our board of directors to issue ordinary shares and preference shares up to our authorized share capital for a period of five years from October 10, 2018. Subject to compliance with applicable rules and regulations, we may issue ordinary shares or securities convertible into ordinary shares from time to time in connection with a financing, acquisition, investment, our share incentive plans or otherwise. Any such issuance could result in substantial dilution to our existing shareholders unless pre-emptive rights exist and cause the market price of our ordinary shares to decline.
Certain holders of our ordinary shares may not be able to exercise pre-emptive rights and as a result may experience substantial dilution upon future issuances of ordinary shares.
Holders of our ordinary shares in principle have a pro rata pre-emptive right with respect to any issue of ordinary shares or the granting of rights to subscribe for ordinary shares, unless Dutch law or our articles of association state otherwise or unless explicitly provided otherwise in a resolution by our general meeting of shareholders (the “General Meeting”), or-if authorized by the annual General Meeting or an extraordinary General Meeting-by a resolution of our board of directors. Our 2018 Extraordinary Meeting has empowered our board of directors to limit or exclude pre-emptive rights on ordinary shares for a period of five years from October 10, 2018, which could cause existing shareholders to experience substantial dilution of their interest in us.
Pre-emptive rights do not exist with respect to the issue of preference shares and holders of preference shares, if any, have no pre-emptive right to acquire newly issued ordinary shares. Also, pre-emptive rights do not exist with respect to the issue of shares or grant of rights to subscribe for shares to employees of the company or contributions in kind.
Sales of substantial amounts of our ordinary shares in the public markets, or the perception that they might occur, could reduce the price that our ordinary shares might otherwise attain.
Sales of a substantial number of shares of our ordinary shares in the public market, particularly sales by our directors, executive officers and significant shareholders, or the perception that these sales could occur, could adversely affect the market price of our ordinary shares and may make it more difficult for you to sell your ordinary shares at a time and price that you deem appropriate.
In addition, holders of an aggregate of 18,138,691 ordinary shares, based on shares outstanding as of April 30, 2021, are entitled to rights with respect to registration of these shares under the Securities Act pursuant to our amended and restated investors’ rights agreement, dated July 19, 2016. If these holders of our ordinary shares, by exercising their registration rights, sell a large number of shares, they could adversely affect the market price for our ordinary shares. We have also filed registration statements on Form S-8 under the Securities Act registering all ordinary shares that we may issue under our equity compensation plan, which may in turn be sold and may adversely affect the market price for our ordinary shares.
Certain anti-takeover provisions in our articles of association and under Dutch law may prevent or could make an acquisition of our company more difficult, limit attempts by our shareholders to replace or remove members of our board of directors and may adversely affect the market price of our ordinary shares.
Our articles of association contain provisions that could delay or prevent a change in control of our company. These provisions could also make it difficult for shareholders to appoint directors that are not nominated by the current members of our board of directors or take other corporate actions, including effecting changes in our management. These provisions include:
•the staggered three-year terms of the members of our board of directors, as a result of which only approximately one-third of the members of our board of directors may be subject to election in any one year;
•a provision that the members of our board of directors may only be removed by a General Meeting by a two-thirds majority of votes cast representing at least 50% of our issued share capital if such removal is not proposed by our board of directors;
•a provision that the members of our board of directors may only be appointed upon binding nomination of the board of directors, which can only be overruled with a two-thirds majority of votes cast representing at least 50% of our issued share capital;
•the inclusion of a class of preference shares in our authorized share capital that may be issued by our board of directors, in such a manner as to dilute the interest of shareholders, including any potential acquirer or activist shareholder, in order to delay or discourage any potential unsolicited offer or shareholder activism;
•requirements that certain matters, including an amendment of our articles of association, may only be brought to our shareholders for a vote upon a proposal by our board of directors; and
•minimum shareholding thresholds, based on nominal value, for shareholders to call General Meetings of our shareholders or to add items to the agenda for those meetings.
We are subject to the Dutch Corporate Governance Code but do not comply with all the suggested governance provisions of the Dutch Corporate Governance Code. This may affect your rights as a shareholder.
As a Dutch company, we are subject to the Dutch Corporate Governance Code (“DCGC”). The DCGC contains both principles and suggested governance provisions for management boards, supervisory boards, shareholders and general meetings, financial reporting, auditors, disclosure, compliance and enforcement standards. The DCGC is based on a “comply or explain” principle. Accordingly, public companies are required to disclose in their annual reports, filed in the Netherlands, whether they comply with the suggested governance provisions of the DCGC. If they do not comply with those provisions (e.g., because of a conflicting requirement), the company is required to give the reasons for such noncompliance. The DCGC applies to all Dutch companies listed on a government-recognized stock exchange, whether in the Netherlands or elsewhere, including the NYSE. The principles and suggested governance provisions apply to our board of directors (in relation to role and composition, conflicts of interest and independency requirements, board committees and remuneration), shareholders and the General Meeting (for example, regarding anti-takeover protection and our obligations to provide information to our shareholders) and financial reporting (such as external auditor and internal audit requirements). We comply with all applicable provisions of the DCGC except where such provisions conflict with U.S. exchange listing requirements or with market
practices in the United States or the Netherlands. This may affect your rights as a shareholder, and you may not have the same level of protection as a shareholder in a Dutch company that fully complies with the suggested governance provisions of the DCGC.
We do not intend to pay dividends in the foreseeable future. As a result, your ability to achieve a return on your investment will depend on appreciation in the price of our ordinary shares.
We have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our shares. We currently intend to retain all available funds and any future earnings for use in the operation of our business and do not anticipate paying any dividends on our ordinary shares in the foreseeable future. Were this position to change, payment of future dividends may be made only if our equity exceeds the amount of the paid-in and called-up part of the issued share capital, increased by the reserves required to be maintained by Dutch law or by our articles of association. Accordingly, investors must rely on sales of their ordinary shares after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any future gains on their investments.
Claims of U.S. civil liabilities may not be enforceable against us.
We are incorporated under the laws of the Netherlands and substantial portions of our assets are located outside of the United States. In addition, two members of our board of directors and certain experts named herein reside outside the United States. As a result, it may be difficult for investors to effect service of process within the United States upon us or such other persons residing outside the United States, or to enforce outside the United States judgments obtained against such persons in U.S. courts in any action, including actions predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal securities laws. In addition, it may be difficult for investors to enforce, in original actions brought in courts in jurisdictions located outside the United States, rights predicated upon the U.S. federal securities laws.
There is no treaty between the United States and the Netherlands for the mutual recognition and enforcement of judgments (other than arbitration awards) in civil and commercial matters. Therefore, a final judgment rendered by any federal or state court in the United States based on civil liability, whether or not predicated solely upon the U.S. federal securities laws, would not be enforceable in the Netherlands unless the underlying claim is re-litigated before a Dutch court of competent jurisdiction. In such proceedings, however, a Dutch court may be expected to recognize the binding effect of a judgment of a federal or state court in the United States without re-examination of the substantive matters adjudicated thereby, if (i) the jurisdiction of the U.S. federal or state court has been based on internationally accepted principles of private international law, (ii) that judgment resulted from legal proceedings compatible with Dutch notions of due process, (iii) that judgment does not contravene public policy of the Netherlands and (iv) that judgment is not incompatible with (x) an earlier judgment of a Dutch court between the same parties, or (y) an earlier judgment of a foreign court between the same parties in a dispute regarding the same subject and based on the same cause, if that earlier foreign judgment is recognizable in the Netherlands.
Based on the foregoing, there can be no assurance that U.S. investors will be able to enforce against us or members of our board of directors, officers or certain experts named herein, who are residents of the Netherlands or countries other than the United States, any judgments obtained in U.S. courts in civil and commercial matters, including judgments under the U.S. federal securities laws.
In addition, there can be no assurance that a Dutch court would impose civil liability on us, the members of our board of directors, our officers or certain experts named herein in an original action predicated solely upon the U.S. federal securities laws brought in a court of competent jurisdiction in the Netherlands against us or such members, officers or experts, respectively.
U.S. persons who hold our ordinary shares may suffer adverse tax consequences if we are characterized as a passive foreign investment company.
A non-U.S. corporation will generally be considered a passive foreign investment company (“PFIC”), for U.S. federal income tax purposes, in any taxable year if either (1) at least 75% of its gross income for such year is passive income or (2) at least 50% of the value of its assets (based on an average of the quarterly values of the assets during such year) is attributable to assets that produce or are held for the production of passive income (“the PFIC asset test”). For purposes of the PFIC asset test, the value of our assets will generally be determined by reference to our market capitalization. Based on our past and current projections of our income and assets, we do not expect to be a PFIC for the current taxable year or for the foreseeable future. Nevertheless, a separate factual determination as to whether we are or have become a PFIC must be made each year (after the close of such year). Since our projections may differ from our actual business results and our market capitalization and value of our assets may fluctuate, we cannot assure you that we will not be or become a PFIC in the current taxable year or any future taxable year. If we are a PFIC for any taxable year during which a U.S. person (as defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended) holds our ordinary shares, such U.S. person may be subject to adverse tax consequences. Each U.S. person who holds our ordinary shares is strongly urged to consult his, her or its tax advisor regarding the application of these rules and the availability of any potential elections.
If a U.S. person is treated as owning at least 10% of our ordinary shares, such U.S. person may be subject to adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences.
If a U.S. person is treated as owning (directly, indirectly, or constructively) at least 10% of the total combined voting power of our shares, or of the total value of our shares, such shareholder may be treated as a “United States shareholder” with respect to each “controlled foreign corporation” in our group (if any). Under changes implemented by the legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, because our group includes one or more U.S. subsidiaries, certain of our non-U.S. subsidiaries could be treated as controlled foreign corporations (regardless of whether we are treated as a controlled foreign corporation). A United States shareholder of a controlled foreign corporation may be required to report annually and include in its U.S. taxable income its pro rata share of “Subpart F income,” “global intangible low-taxed income,” and investments in U.S. property by controlled foreign corporations, regardless of whether we make any distributions. An individual that is a United States shareholder with respect to a controlled foreign corporation generally would not be allowed certain tax deductions or foreign tax credits that would be allowed to a United States shareholder that is a U.S. corporation. We cannot provide any assurances that we will assist investors in determining whether we or any of our non-U.S. subsidiaries is treated as a controlled foreign corporation or whether any investor is treated as a United States shareholder with respect to any such controlled foreign corporation or furnish to any investor who may be a United States shareholder information that may be necessary to comply with the aforementioned reporting and tax paying obligations. Failure to comply with these reporting obligations may subject a shareholder who is a United States shareholder to significant monetary penalties and may prevent from starting the statute of limitations with respect to such shareholder’s U.S. federal income tax return for the year for which reporting was due. A U.S. person should consult its advisors regarding the potential application of these rules to an investment in our ordinary shares.
We may not be able to make distributions or repurchase shares without subjecting our shareholders to Dutch withholding tax, and dividends distributed on our ordinary shares to certain related parties in low-tax jurisdictions might in the future become subject to an additional Dutch withholding tax.
We have not paid a dividend on our ordinary shares in the past and we do not intend to pay any dividends to holders of our ordinary shares in the foreseeable future. See “Risk Factors-We do not intend to pay dividends in the foreseeable future. As a result, your ability to achieve a return on your investment will depend on appreciation in the price of our ordinary shares.” However, if we ever do pay dividends or repurchase shares, then under current Dutch tax law, the dividend paid or repurchase price paid may be subject to Dutch dividend withholding tax at a rate of 15% under the Dutch Dividend Withholding Tax Act (Wet op de dividendbelasting 1965, “Regular Dividend Withholding Tax”), unless a domestic or treaty exemption applies.
On March 25, 2021, the Dutch State Secretary of Finance submitted a proposal of law to the Dutch parliament pursuant to which an alternative withholding tax (“Alternative Withholding Tax”) will be imposed on dividends paid to related entities in designated low-tax jurisdictions, effective 1 January 2024. An entity is considered related if (i) it has a “Qualifying Interest” in our company, (ii) our company has a “Qualifying Interest” in the entity holding the ordinary shares, or (iii) a third party has a ""Qualifying Interest"" in both our company and the entity holding the ordinary shares. The term “Qualifying Interest” means a direct or indirectly held interest either by an entity individually or jointly if an entity is part of a collaborating group (samenwerkende groep) that enables such entity or such collaborating group to exercise a definite influence over another entities' decisions, such as our company or an entity holding ordinary shares as the case may be, and allows it to determine the other entities' activities. The Alternative Withholding Tax will be imposed at the highest Dutch corporate income tax rate in effect at the time of the distribution (currently 25%). The Alternative Withholding Tax will be reduced, but not below zero, with any Regular Dividend Withholding Tax imposed on distributions. As such, based on currently applicable rates, the overall effective rate of withholding of Regular Dividend Withholding Tax and Alternative Withholding Tax will not exceed the highest corporate income tax rate in effect at the time of the distribution (currently 25%). The proposal of law is subject to amendment during the course of the legislative process and it needs to be approved by both chambers of the Dutch parliament before it can enter into force.
If we cease to be a Dutch tax resident for the purposes of a tax treaty concluded by the Netherlands and in certain other events, we could potentially be subject to a proposed Dutch dividend withholding tax in respect of a deemed distribution of our entire market value less paid-up capital.
Under a proposal of law currently pending before the Dutch parliament, the Emergency act conditional dividend exit tax (Spoedwet conditionele eindafrekening dividendbelasting “Dividend Exit Tax”), we will be deemed to have distributed an amount equal to our entire market capitalization less recognized paid-up capital immediately before the occurrence of certain events, including if we cease to be a Dutch tax resident for purposes of a tax treaty concluded by the Netherlands and become, for purposes of such tax treaty, a tax resident of a non-qualifying jurisdiction. This deemed distribution will be subject to a 15% tax. An automatic interest free unconditional indefinite extension for the full amount of the tax will be granted. However, the extension will expire, inter alia, if and to the extent we make distributions after the taxable event for the purposes of the Dividend Exit Tax (in respect of which the extension is granted). In that event, the Dividend Exit Tax rules prescribe that we
will have a right to recover the tax from our shareholders through set-off against their dividend receivable. If we do not recover this amount from our shareholders, we will have to pay such part of the deferred tax ourselves. It is not certain whether the Dividend Exit Tax will be enacted and if so, in what form. If enacted in its present form before the Dutch parliament the Dividend Exit Tax will have retroactive effect from September 18, 2020.
General Risk Factors
Unfavorable or uncertain conditions in our industry or the global economy or reductions in information technology spending, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, could limit our ability to grow our business and negatively affect our results of operations.
Our results of operations may vary based on the impact of changes in our industry or the global economy on us or our customers. Current or future economic uncertainties or downturns could adversely affect our business and results of operations. Negative conditions in the general economy both in the United States and abroad, including conditions resulting from changes in gross domestic product growth, financial and credit market fluctuations, international trade relations, political instability or unrest and new developments resulting from recent elections and changes of administration, natural catastrophes, warfare, infectious diseases and terrorist attacks on the United States, Europe, the Asia Pacific region or elsewhere, could cause a decrease in business investments by our customers and potential customers, including spending on information technology, and negatively affect the growth of our business. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic has curtailed business spending by our customers, resulted in business disruptions for us and/or our customers, restricted travel to customer sites and resulted in a quarantine of affected populations impacting our employees, partners and customers. Additionally, mitigation and containment measures adopted by government authorities to contain the spread of COVID-19 in the U.S. and abroad may significantly impact business continuity for our partners and our customers, reduce our customers’ business operations, delay their engagement with us (including due to travel restrictions and restrictions on in-person meetings) and could thereby adversely affect our business and financial results. Further, these measures by government authorities may continue to remain in place for a significant period of time or, even if lifted, could be reinstated at any time, and additional and/or extended measures could significantly impact the ability of our employees and customers and vendors to work productively.
To the extent our offerings are perceived by customers and potential customers as discretionary, our revenue may be disproportionately affected by delays or reductions in general information technology spending. Also, customers may choose to develop in-house software as an alternative to using our products. Moreover, competitors may respond to market conditions by lowering prices. We cannot predict the timing, strength or duration of any economic slowdown, instability or recovery, generally or within any particular industry. If the economic conditions of the general economy or markets in which we operate do not improve, or worsen from present levels, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.
We may acquire other businesses which could require significant management attention, disrupt our business, or dilute shareholder value. We may be unable to integrate acquired businesses and technologies, and acquisitions could adversely affect our results of operations.
As part of our business strategy, we may acquire or make investments in complementary companies, products, or technologies. We have in the past acquired, and expect in the future to acquire, businesses that we believe will complement or augment our existing business, such as our acquisition of Endgame in October 2019. The identification of suitable acquisition candidates is difficult, and we may not be able to complete such acquisitions on favorable terms, if at all. If we do complete future acquisitions, we may not ultimately strengthen our competitive position or achieve our goals and business strategy, we may be subject to claims or liabilities assumed from an acquired company, product, or technology, and any acquisitions we complete could be viewed negatively by our customers, investors, and securities analysts. In addition, if we are unsuccessful at integrating Endgame or future acquisitions, or the technologies associated with such acquisitions, into our company, the revenue and results of operations of the combined company could be adversely affected. Any integration process may require significant time and resources, which may disrupt our ongoing business and divert management’s attention, and we may not be able to manage the integration process successfully. We may not successfully evaluate or utilize acquired technology or personnel, realize anticipated synergies from acquisitions, or accurately forecast the financial impact of an acquisition transaction and integration of such acquisition, including accounting charges. We may have to pay cash, incur debt, or issue equity or equity-linked securities to pay for any future acquisitions, each of which could adversely affect our financial condition or the market price of our ordinary shares. The sale of equity or issuance of equity-linked debt to finance any future acquisitions could result in dilution to our shareholders. The incurrence of indebtedness would result in increased fixed obligations and could also include covenants or other restrictions that would impede our ability to manage our operations. Additionally, we may acquire development stage companies that are not yet profitable, and that require continued investment, which could adversely affect our results of operations and liquidity. The occurrence of any of these risks could harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
Catastrophic events, or man-made problems such as terrorism, may disrupt our business.
A significant natural disaster, such as an earthquake, fire, flood, or significant power outage could have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. The impact of climate change may increase these risks due to changes in weather patterns, such as increases in storm intensity, sea-level rise, melting of permafrost and temperature extremes in areas where we or our suppliers and customers conduct business. We have a number of our employees and executive officers located in the San Francisco Bay Area, a region known for seismic activity and wildfires. In the event our or our partners’ abilities are hindered by any of the events discussed above, sales could be delayed, resulting in missed financial targets for a particular quarter. In addition, acts of terrorism, acts of war, other geo-political unrest or health issues, such as an outbreak of pandemic or epidemic diseases, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, or fear of such events, could cause disruptions in our business or the business of our partners, customers or the economy as a whole. Any disruption in the business of our partners or customers that affects sales in a given fiscal quarter could have a significant adverse impact on our quarterly results for that and future quarters. For example, the full extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts our business, results of operations and financial condition will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected the economies of many countries, resulting in economic downturns that could affect demand for our products and likely impact our operating results. All of the aforementioned risks may be further increased if our disaster recovery plans prove to be inadequate. See the risk factor entitled “The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic could harm our business and results of operations.”
If our estimates or judgments relating to our critical accounting policies are based on assumptions that change or prove to be incorrect, our results of operations could fall below expectations of securities analysts and investors, resulting in a decline in the trading price of our ordinary shares.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, as provided in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets, liabilities, equity, revenue, and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. Our results of operations may be adversely affected if our assumptions change or if actual circumstances differ from those in our assumptions, which could cause our results of operations to fall below our publicly announced guidance or the expectations of securities analysts and investors, resulting in a decline in the market price of our ordinary shares. Significant assumptions and estimates used in preparing our consolidated financial statements include those related to revenue recognition, measurement of stock-based compensation expense, accounting of intangible assets, goodwill impairment test, and accounting for income taxes including deferred tax assets and liabilities.
If industry or financial analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, or if they issue inaccurate or unfavorable research regarding our ordinary shares, our share price and trading volume could decline, which could adversely affect our business.
The trading market for our ordinary shares is influenced by the research and reports that industry or financial analysts publish about us or our business. We do not control these analysts, or the content and opinions included in their reports. If any of the analysts who cover us issues an inaccurate or unfavorable opinion regarding our company, our stock price would likely decline. In addition, the stock prices of many companies in the technology industry have declined significantly after those companies have failed to meet, or significantly exceed, the financial guidance publicly announced by the companies or the expectations of analysts or public investors. If our financial results fail to meet, or significantly exceed, our announced guidance or the expectations of analysts or public investors, our stock price may decline. Further, analysts could downgrade our ordinary shares or publish unfavorable research about us. If one or more of the analysts who cover our company ceases to cover us, or fails to publish reports on us regularly, our visibility in the financial markets could decrease, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline and could adversely affect our business.
The requirements of being a public company may strain our resources, divert management’s attention and affect our ability to attract and retain senior management and qualified board members.
As a public company, we are subject to the reporting and corporate governance requirements of the Exchange Act, the listing requirements of the NYSE and other applicable securities rules and regulations, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. Compliance with these rules and regulations has increased, and we expect will continue increasing our legal and financial compliance costs, make some activities more difficult, time-consuming or costly and increase demand on our systems and resources.
Among other things, the Exchange Act requires that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and results of operations, and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires that we maintain effective disclosure controls and
procedures and internal control over financial reporting. In order to improve our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting to meet this standard, significant resources and management oversight is required. As a result, management’s attention may be diverted from other business concerns, which could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Although we have already hired additional personnel to help comply with these requirements, we may need to further expand our legal and finance departments in the future or hire outside consultants, which will increase our costs and expenses.
In addition, changing laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure are creating uncertainty for public companies, increasing legal and financial compliance costs and making some activities more time-consuming. These laws, regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations, in many cases due to their lack of specificity, and, as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies. This could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices. We intend to invest resources to comply with evolving laws, regulations and standards, and this investment may result in increased general and administrative expense and a diversion of management’s time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. If our efforts to comply with new laws, regulations and standards differ from the activities intended by regulatory or governing bodies, regulatory authorities may initiate legal proceedings against us and our business and prospects may be harmed. As a result of disclosure of information in the filings required of a public company and in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our business and financial condition will become more visible, which may result in threatened or actual litigation, including by competitors and other third parties. If such claims are successful, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be materially harmed, and even if the claims do not result in litigation or are resolved in our favor, these claims, and the time and resources necessary to resolve them, could divert the resources of our management and materially harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. These factors could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified senior management or members of our board of directors, particularly to serve on our audit and compensation committees.
If we fail to maintain an effective system of disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting, we may be unable to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud, and investor confidence and the market price of our ordinary shares may decline, which could adversely affect our business.
As a public company in the United States, we are subject to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. In order to maintain and improve the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, we have expended and anticipate that we will continue to expend significant resources, including accounting-related costs and significant management oversight. For example, since our IPO, we have hired additional accounting and financial staff with appropriate public company experience and technical accounting knowledge to assist in our compliance efforts. We have incurred and expect to continue to incur significant expenses and devote substantial management effort toward compliance with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. To assist us in complying with these requirements we may need to hire more employees in the future, or engage outside consultants, which will increase our operating expenses.
Despite significant investment, our current controls and any new controls that we develop may become inadequate because of changes in conditions in our business. Further, weaknesses in our disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting may be discovered in the future. Any failure to implement or maintain effective controls or any difficulties encountered in their implementation or improvement could harm our results of operations or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations and may result in a restatement of our financial statements for prior periods. Any failure to implement and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could also adversely affect the results of periodic management evaluations and annual independent registered public accounting firm attestation reports regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting that are required to be included in our periodic reports that we file with the SEC.
Ineffective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial and other information, subject us to sanctions or investigations by the NYSE, the SEC or other regulatory authorities, and would likely cause the trading price of our ordinary shares to decline, which could adversely affect our business.","Item 1B.

None","Item 2. Properties.
As a distributed company, we employ a distributed workforce with offices and employee hubs around the world. The largest of these hubs is located in Mountain View, California, where we lease approximately 40,000 square feet.
All offices are leased and we do not own any real property. We intend to procure additional space in the future as we continue to add employees and expand geographically. We believe that our current facilities are adequate to meet our current needs and that, as we grow, suitable additional space will be available to either expand existing hubs or open new hubs in new locations.","Item 3. Legal Proceedings.
The information called for by this Item is incorporated herein by reference to Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” Note 7, “Commitments and Contingencies” included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
From time to time, we may be subject to legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business, including patent, commercial, product liability, employment, class action, whistleblower and other litigation and claims, as well as governmental and other regulatory investigations and proceedings. In addition, third parties may from time to time assert claims against us in the form of letters and other communications. We are not currently a party to any legal proceedings that, if determined adversely to us, would, in our opinion, have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. Future litigation may be necessary to defend ourselves, our partners and our customers by determining the scope, enforceability and validity of third-party proprietary rights, or to establish our proprietary rights. The results of any current or future litigation cannot be predicted with certainty, and regardless of the outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on us because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources and other factors.","Item 4.

Overview
Elastic is a search company. We deliver technology that enables users to search through massive amounts of structured and unstructured data for a wide range of use cases. Our primary offering is the Elastic Stack, a powerful set of software products that ingest and store data from any source, and in any format, and perform search, analysis, and visualization in milliseconds or less. The Elastic Stack is designed for direct use by developers to power a variety of use cases. We also offer three software solutions - Enterprise Search, Observability, and Security - built on the Elastic Stack. Our solutions are designed to be deployed everywhere: in public or private clouds, in hybrid environments, or in traditional on-premises environments. Our products are used by individual developers and organizations of all sizes across a wide range of industries.
Elasticsearch is the heart of the Elastic Stack. It is a distributed, real-time search and analytics engine and datastore for exploring all types of data including textual, numerical, geospatial, structured, and unstructured. The first public release of Elasticsearch was in 2010 by our co-founder Shay Banon as an open source project. The Company was formed in 2012. Since then, we have added new products, released new features, acquired companies, and created new solutions to expand the functionality of our products.
Our business model is based on a combination of free and paid proprietary software. We market and distribute the Elastic Stack and our solutions using a free and open distribution strategy. Developers are able to download our software directly from our website. Some features of our software can be downloaded and used free of charge. Others are only available through paid subscriptions, which include access to specific proprietary features and also include support. These paid features can be unlocked without the need to re-deploy the software. There is no free subscription tier in our cloud offerings, where all subscriptions are paid.
In February 2021, with the release of version 7.11 of the Elastic Stack, we changed the way we license Elasticsearch and Kibana, the visualization layer for data stored in Elasticsearch. We moved the source code that had historically been licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 open source license (“Apache 2.0”), to be dual licensed under ELv2, our proprietary source available license, and SSPL, at the user’s election. ELv2 is a permissive source available license, allowing free use, modification, creation of derivative works, and redistribution, while providing protection from cloud service providers who offer these products as a service without collaborating with us. SSPL is a source available license that provides many of the freedoms of an open source license, but with certain restrictions. This source code license change had no effect on our customers or the vast majority of our users.
We believe that our free and open distribution strategy drives a number of benefits for our users, our customers, and our company. It facilitates rapid and efficient developer adoption, particularly by empowering individual developers to download and use our software without payment, registration, or the friction of a formal sales interaction. It fosters a vibrant developer community around our products and solutions, which drives adoption of our products and increased interaction among users. Further, this approach enables community review of our code and products, which allows us to improve the reliability and security of our software.
We generate revenue primarily from sales of subscriptions for our software. We offer various paid subscription tiers that provide different levels of rights to use proprietary features and access to support. We do not sell support separately. Our subscription agreements for self-managed and Elastic Cloud deployments typically have terms of one to three years and we usually bill for them annually in advance. Elastic Cloud customers may also purchase subscriptions on a month-to-month basis without a commitment, with usage billed at the end of each month. Subscriptions accounted for 93%, 92% and 91% of total
revenue in the years ended April 30, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. We also generate revenue from consulting and training services.
We had over 15,000 customers, over 11,300 customers and over 8,100 customers as of April 30, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. We define a customer as an entity that generated revenue in the quarter ending on the measurement date from an annual or month-to-month subscription. Affiliated entities are typically counted as a single customer. The annual contract value (“ACV”) of a customer’s commitments is calculated based on the terms of that customer’s subscriptions, and represents the total committed annual subscription amount as of the measurement date. Month-to-month subscriptions are not included in the calculation of ACV. The number of customers who represented greater than $100,000 in ACV was over 730, over 610, and over 440 as of April 30, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
We engage in various sales and marketing efforts to extend our free and open distribution model. We employ multi-touch marketing campaigns to nurture our users and customers and keep them engaged after they download our software. Additionally, we maintain direct sales efforts focused on users and customers who have adopted our software, as well as departmental decision-makers and senior executives who have broad purchasing power in their organizations. Our sales teams are primarily segmented by geographies and secondarily by the employee count of our customers. They focus on both initial conversion of users into customers and additional sales to existing customers. In addition to our direct sales efforts, we also maintain partnerships to further extend our reach and awareness of our products around the world.
We continue to make substantial investments in developing the Elastic Stack and our solutions and expanding our global sales and marketing footprint. With a distributed team spanning over 35 countries, we are able to recruit, hire, and retain high-quality, experienced technical and sales personnel and operate at a rapid pace to drive product releases, fix bugs, and create and market new products. We had 2,179 employees as of April 30, 2021.
We have experienced significant growth, with revenue increasing to $608.5 million in the year ended April 30, 2021 from $427.6 million in the year ended April 30, 2020 and $271.7 million in the year ended April 30, 2019, representing year-over-year growth of 42% for the year ended April 30, 2021 and 57% for the year ended April 30, 2020. In the year ended April 30, 2021, revenue from outside the United States accounted for 45% of our total revenue. For our non-U.S. operations, the majority of our revenue and expenses are denominated in currencies such as the Euro and British pound. No customer represented more than 10% of our total revenue in the years ended April 30, 2021, 2020, and 2019. We have not been profitable to date. In the years ended April 30, 2021, 2020 and 2019, we incurred net losses of $129.4 million, $167.2 million and $102.3 million, respectively. Our net cash provided by operating activities was $22.5 million in the year ended April 30, 2021 and cash used in operating activities in the years ended April 30, 2020 and 2019 was $30.6 million and $23.9 million, respectively. We have experienced losses in each year since our incorporation and as of April 30, 2021, had an accumulated deficit of $613.3 million. We expect we will continue to incur net losses for the foreseeable future. There can be no assurance as to when we may become profitable.
COVID-19
In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic. Efforts to control its spread have significantly curtailed the movement of people, goods and services worldwide, including in most or all of the regions in which we sell our products and services and conduct our business operations, negatively impacting worldwide economic activity. The ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operational and financial performance will depend on certain developments, including the duration and spread of the virus, success of preventative measures to contain or mitigate the spread of the virus and emerging variants, effectiveness, distribution and acceptance of COVID-19 vaccines, impact on our customers and our sales cycles, impact on our customer, employee or industry events, effect on our vendors, and the uneven impact of the COVID-19 pandemic to certain industries, all of which continue to remain uncertain and cannot be predicted.
The continuing COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a global slowdown of economic activity and its impact has varied significantly across different industries with certain industries experiencing increased demand for their products and services, while others have struggled to maintain demand for their products and services consistent with historical levels. There have been delays in purchasing decisions from existing and prospective customers, longer sales cycles, delayed implementation of professional services, reduced renewals of subscriptions by existing customers, and changes in approaches to creating sales pipeline in the absence of in-person marketing events, resulting in headwinds for calculated billings and our Net Expansion Rate.
Notwithstanding the potential and actual adverse impacts described above, as the pandemic has caused more of our customers to shift to a virtual workforce or accelerate their digital transformation efforts, we believe the value of our solutions is becoming even more evident. In addition, we have benefited from lower spending on travel due to COVID-19 travel restrictions and from holding events virtually, and we expect lower travel costs to continue in the near-term.
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic and in an effort to focus on maintaining business continuity and preparing for the future and long-term success of our business, we have taken precautionary measures intended to help minimize the risk of
the virus to our employees, our customers, and the communities in which we operate, including modifying our business practices, such as suspending employee travel, adapting employee work locations, and holding events and trainings virtually. Further, we also temporarily reduced the pace of our investments in our business in response to the COVID-19 pandemic in the first quarter of fiscal 2021, but began to gradually increase our investments in our business since then. We intend to continue to increase the pace of our investments in the business in fiscal 2022. We continue to monitor the major impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and make changes in our business as appropriate, in response to such impacts. See “Risk Factors” included in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of additional risks.
Key Factors Affecting Our Performance
We believe that the growth and future success of our business depends on many factors, including those described below. While each of these factors presents significant opportunities for our business, they also pose important challenges that we must successfully address in order to sustain our growth and improve our results of operations.
Growing the Elastic community. Our strategy consists of providing access to source available software, on both a free and paid basis, and fostering a community of users and developers. Our strategy is designed to pursue what we believe to be significant untapped potential for the use of our technology. After developers begin to use our software and start to participate in our developer community, they become more likely to apply our technology to additional use cases and evangelize our technology within their organizations. This reduces the time required for our sales force to educate potential leads on our solutions. In order to capitalize on our opportunity, we intend to make further investments to keep the Elastic Stack accessible and well known to software developers around the world. We intend to continue to invest in our products and support and engage our user base and developer community through content, events, and conferences in the U.S. and internationally. Our results of operations may fluctuate as we make these investments.
Developing new features for the Elastic Stack. The Elastic Stack is applied to various use cases by customers, including through the solutions we offer. Our revenue is derived primarily from subscriptions of Enterprise Search, Observability and Security built into the Elastic Stack. We believe that releasing additional features of the Elastic Stack, including our solutions, drives usage of our products and ultimately drives our growth. To that end, we plan to continue to invest in building new features and solutions that expand the capabilities of the Elastic Stack. These investments may adversely affect our operating results prior to generating benefits, to the extent that they ultimately generate benefits at all.
Growing our customer base by converting users of our software to paid subscribers. Our financial performance depends on growing our paid customer base by converting free users of our software into paid subscribers. Our distribution model has resulted in rapid adoption by developers around the world. We have invested, and expect to continue to invest, heavily in sales and marketing efforts to convert additional free users to paid subscribers. Our investment in sales and marketing is significant given our large and diverse user base. The investments are likely to occur in advance of the anticipated benefits resulting from such investments, such that they may adversely affect our operating results in the near term.
Expanding within our current customer base. Our future growth and profitability depend on our ability to drive additional sales to existing customers. Customers often expand the use of our software within their organizations by increasing the number of developers using our products, increasing the utilization of our products for a particular use case, and expanding use of our products to additional use cases. We focus some of our direct sales efforts on encouraging these types of expansion within our customer base.
An indication of how our customer relationships have expanded over time is through our Net Expansion Rate, which is based upon trends in the ACV of customers that have entered into annual subscription agreements. To calculate an expansion rate as of the end of a given month, we start with the ACV from all such customers as of twelve months prior to that month end, or Prior Period Value. We then calculate the ACV from these same customers as of the given month end, or Current Period Value, which includes any growth in the value of their subscriptions and is net of contraction or attrition over the prior twelve months. We then divide the Current Period Value by the Prior Period Value to arrive at an expansion rate. The Net Expansion Rate at the end of any period is the weighted average of the expansion rates as of the end of each of the trailing twelve months. We believe that our Net Expansion Rate provides useful information about the evolution of our business’ existing customers. The Net Expansion Rate includes the dollar-weighted value of our subscriptions that expand, renew, contract, or attrit. For instance, if each customer had a one-year subscription and renewed its subscription for the exact same amount, then the Net Expansion Rate would be 100%. Customers who reduced their annual subscription dollar value (contraction) or did not renew their annual subscription (attrition) would adversely affect the Net Expansion Rate. Our Net Expansion Rate was slightly below 130% at the end of fiscal 2021.
As large organizations expand their use of the Elastic Stack across multiple use cases, projects, divisions and users, they often begin to require centralized provisioning, management and monitoring across multiple deployments. To satisfy these requirements, we offer the Elastic Enterprise subscription. We will continue to focus some of our direct sales efforts on driving adoption of our paid offerings.
Increasing adoption of Elastic Cloud. Elastic Cloud, our family of SaaS products that includes Elasticsearch Service and Site Search Service, is an important growth opportunity for our business. Organizations are increasingly looking for SaaS deployment alternatives with reduced administrative burdens. In some cases, users of our source available software that have been self-managing deployments of the Elastic Stack subsequently become paying subscribers of Elastic Cloud. In the years ended April 30, 2021, 2020 and 2019, Elastic Cloud contributed 27%, 22% and 17% of our total revenue, respectively. We believe that offering a SaaS deployment alternative is important for achieving our long-term growth potential, and we expect Elastic Cloud’s contribution to our subscription revenue to increase over time. However, an increase in the relative contribution of Elastic Cloud to our business could adversely impact our gross margin as a result of the associated hosting costs.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
In addition to our results determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, we believe the following non-GAAP measures are useful in evaluating our operating performance. We use the following non-GAAP financial information to evaluate our ongoing operations and for internal planning and forecasting purposes. We believe that non-GAAP financial information, when taken collectively, may be helpful to investors because it provides consistency and comparability with past financial performance. However, non-GAAP financial information is presented for supplemental informational purposes only, has limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial information presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. In particular, free cash flow is not a substitute for cash used in operating activities. Additionally, the utility of free cash flow as a measure of our financial performance and liquidity is further limited as it does not represent the total increase or decrease in our cash balance for a given period. In addition, other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate similarly-titled non-GAAP measures differently or may use other measures to evaluate their performance, all of which could reduce the usefulness of our non-GAAP financial measures as tools for comparison. A reconciliation is provided below for each non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable financial measure stated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Investors are encouraged to review the related GAAP financial measures and the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, and not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business.
We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures, when taken together with the corresponding GAAP financial measures, provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance by excluding certain items that may not be indicative of our business, operating results or future outlook.
Non-GAAP Gross Profit and Non-GAAP Gross Margin
We define non-GAAP gross profit and non-GAAP gross margin as GAAP gross profit and GAAP gross margin, respectively, excluding stock-based compensation expense, employer payroll taxes on employee stock transactions, and amortization of acquired intangible assets. We believe non-GAAP gross profit and non-GAAP gross margin provide our management and investors consistency and comparability with our past financial performance and facilitate period-to-period comparisons of operations, as these metrics generally eliminate the effects of certain variables from period to period for reasons unrelated to overall operating performance.

Non-GAAP Operating Loss and Non-GAAP Operating Margin
We define non-GAAP operating loss and non-GAAP operating margin as GAAP operating loss and GAAP operating margin, respectively, excluding stock-based compensation expense, employer payroll taxes on employee stock transactions, amortization of acquired intangible assets, and acquisition-related expenses. We believe non-GAAP operating loss and non-GAAP operating margin provide our management and investors consistency and comparability with our past financial performance and facilitate period-to-period comparisons of operations, as these metrics generally eliminate the effects of certain variables from period to period for reasons unrelated to overall operating performance.

Free Cash Flow and Free Cash Flow Margin
Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure that we define as net cash provided by (used in) operating activities less purchases of property and equipment and capitalized internal-use software costs. Free cash flow margin is calculated as free cash flow divided by total revenue. We believe that free cash flow and free cash flow margin are useful indicators of liquidity that provide information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated from our core operations that, after the purchases of property and equipment, can be used for strategic initiatives, including investing in our business and selectively pursuing acquisitions and strategic investments. We further believe that historical and future trends in free cash flow and free cash flow margin, even if negative, provide useful information about the amount of net cash provided by (used in) operating activities that is available (or not available) to be used for strategic initiatives. For example, if free cash flow is negative, we may need to access cash reserves or other sources of capital to invest in strategic initiatives. One limitation of free cash flow and free cash flow margin is that they do not reflect our future contractual commitments. Additionally, free cash flow does not represent the total increase or decrease in our cash balance for a given period.
The following table presents our cash flows for the periods presented and a reconciliation of free cash flow and free cash flow margin to net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP:

Calculated Billings
We define calculated billings as total revenue plus the increase in total deferred revenue as presented on or derived from our consolidated statements of cash flows less the (increase) decrease in total unbilled accounts receivable in a given period. Calculated billings exclude deferred revenue and unbilled accounts receivable acquired through acquisitions in the period of the acquisition. We typically invoice our customers annually in advance, and to a lesser extent multi-year in advance, quarterly in advance, monthly in advance, monthly in arrears or upon delivery. Our management uses calculated billings to understand and evaluate our near-term cash flows and operating results. The following table presents our calculated billings for the periods presented and a reconciliation of calculated billings to total revenue, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP:

Components of Results of Operations
Revenue
Subscription. Our revenue is primarily generated through the sale of subscriptions to software, which is either self-managed by the user or hosted and managed by us in the cloud. Subscriptions provide the right to use paid proprietary software features and access to support for our paid and unpaid software.
A portion of the revenue from self-managed subscriptions is generally recognized up front at the point in time when the license is delivered. This revenue is presented as License - self-managed in our consolidated statements of operations. The remainder of revenue from self-managed subscriptions is recognized ratably over the subscription term while revenue from subscriptions that require access to the cloud or that are hosted and managed by us or by a partner on our behalf in the cloud is recognized ratably over the subscription term or on a usage basis; both are presented within Subscription - self-managed and SaaS in our consolidated statements of operations.
Professional services. Professional services is composed of consulting services as well as public and private training. Consulting services are generally time-based arrangements. Revenue for professional services is recognized as these services are performed.
Cost of Revenue
Subscription. Cost of license - self-managed consists of amortization of certain intangible assets. Cost of subscription - self-managed and SaaS consists primarily of personnel and related costs for employees associated with supporting our subscription arrangements, certain third-party expenses, and amortization of certain intangible and other assets. Personnel and related costs, or personnel costs, comprise cash compensation, benefits and stock-based compensation to employees, costs of third-party contractors, and allocated overhead costs. Third-party expenses consist of cloud hosting costs and other expenses directly associated with our customer support. We expect our cost of subscription - self-managed and SaaS to increase in absolute dollars as our subscription revenue increases.
Professional services. Cost of professional services revenue consists primarily of personnel costs directly associated with delivery of training, implementation and other professional services, costs of third-party contractors, facility rental charges and allocated overhead costs. We expect our cost of professional services revenue to increase in absolute dollars as we invest in our business and as professional services revenue increases.
Gross profit and gross margin. Gross profit represents revenue less cost of revenue. Gross margin, or gross profit as a percentage of revenue, has been and will continue to be affected by a variety of factors, including the timing of our acquisition of new customers and our renewals with existing customers, the average sales price of our subscriptions and professional services, the amount of our revenue represented by hosted services, the mix of subscriptions sold, the mix of revenue between subscriptions and professional services, the mix of professional services between consulting and training, transaction volume growth and support case volume growth. We expect our gross margin to fluctuate over time depending on the factors described above. We expect our revenue from Elastic Cloud to continue to increase as a percentage of total revenue, which we expect will adversely impact our gross margin as a result of the associated hosting costs.
Operating Expenses
Research and development. Research and development expense mainly consists of personnel costs and allocated overhead costs for employees and contractors. We expect our research and development expense to increase in absolute dollars for the foreseeable future as we continue to develop new technology and invest further in our existing products.
Sales and marketing. Sales and marketing expense mainly consists of personnel costs, commissions, allocated overhead costs and costs related to marketing programs and user events. Marketing programs consist of advertising, events, brand-building and customer acquisition and retention activities. We expect our sales and marketing expense to increase in absolute dollars as we expand our salesforce and increase our investments in marketing resources. We capitalize sales
commissions and associated payroll taxes paid to internal sales personnel that are related to the acquisition of customer contracts. Sales commissions costs are amortized over the expected benefit period.
General and administrative. General and administrative expense mainly consists of personnel costs for our management, finance, legal, human resources, and other administrative employees. Our general and administrative expense also includes professional fees, accounting fees, audit fees, tax services and legal fees, as well as insurance, allocated overhead costs, and other corporate expenses. We expect our general and administrative expense to increase in absolute dollars as we increase the size of our general and administrative functions to support the growth of our business. We also anticipate that we will continue to incur additional costs for employees and third-party consulting services related to operating as a public company.
Other Income, Net
Other income, net primarily consists of gains and losses from transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency, interest income and interest expense.
Provision for (Benefit from) Income Taxes
Provision for (benefit from) income taxes consists primarily of income taxes related to the Netherlands, U.S. federal, state and foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct business. Our effective tax rate is affected by recurring items, such as tax rates in jurisdictions outside the Netherlands and the relative amounts of income we earn in those jurisdictions, and non-deductible stock-based compensation.

Total subscription revenue increased $175.2 million, or 45%, in the year ended April 30, 2021 compared to the prior year. The increase in revenue was primarily caused by volume-driven increases from new business, as existing customers purchased additional subscriptions, and we grew our subscription customer base to over 15,000 customers in the year ended April 30, 2021 compared to over 11,300 customers in the prior year.
Professional services revenue increased by $5.7 million, or 16%, in the year ended April 30, 2021 compared to the prior year. The increase in professional services revenue was attributable to increased adoption of our professional services consulting offerings.

Total cost of subscription revenue increased by $36.7 million, or 43%, in the year ended April 30, 2021 compared to the prior year. This increase was primarily due to an increase of $26.2 million in cloud infrastructure costs and an increase of $8.1 million in personnel and related charges from growth in headcount in our support organization. In addition, amortization of acquired intangible assets increased $1.2 million. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $1.7 million in travel expenses due to COVID-19 related travel restrictions. The increase in personnel and related costs includes an increase of $4.3 million in salaries and related taxes and an increase of $3.0 million in stock-based compensation expense. Total subscription margin remained flat at 78% in the year ended April 30, 2021 compared to the prior year.
Cost of professional services revenue increased by $1.6 million, or 4%, in the year ended April 30, 2021 compared to the prior year. This increase was primarily due to an increase of $5.9 million in personnel and related costs, including increases of $3.8 million in salaries and related taxes and $1.8 million in stock-based compensation driven by an increase in headcount in our consulting and training organizations. In addition, subcontractor costs increased $0.5 million. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $3.4 million in travel expenses and a decrease of $1.3 million in training facility costs due to COVID-19 related restrictions.
Gross margin for professional services revenue was 6% in the year ended April 30, 2021 compared to (4)% for the prior year. The increase in margin is primarily due to the increase in revenue, and a lower than proportionate increase in cost of professional services. The cost of professional services remained relatively flat due to a decrease in travel related costs as we shifted to virtual delivery of professional services in light of travel restrictions due to COVID-19. In recent periods, we have invested in headcount for our professional services organization that we believe will be needed as we continue to grow and expect travel related costs will increase in the future once travel restrictions lift. Our gross margin for professional services may fluctuate, decline or be negative in the near-term as we seek to expand our professional services business.

In addition, bad debt expense related to expected credit losses on accounts receivable and write-off of uncollectible balances increased by $4.2 million, consulting expense increased by $1.8 million and insurance, business taxes, and charitable donations increased by $2.6 million. These increases were largely offset by a decrease of $1.6 million in travel expenses due to COVID-19 travel restrictions. The increase in personnel and related costs includes an increase of $9.5 million in salaries and related taxes, an increase of $5.0 million in stock-based compensation expense, an increase of $0.7 million in employee benefits expense and an increase of $0.5 million in recruiting costs, which were partially offset by a decrease in acquisition related compensation of $12.5 million.

Other income, net increased by $5.8 million, or 296%, in the year ended April 30, 2021 compared to the prior year. This increase was due to a net increase in foreign currency gains of $9.9 million related primarily to remeasurement of certain asset and liability balances that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the entities in which they are recorded. The foreign currency gains were partially offset by a decrease of $4.0 million in interest income due to lower interest rates.

The provision for income taxes was $7.7 million in the year ended April 30, 2021 compared to a benefit from income taxes of $2.0 million in the prior year. The additional tax expense is primarily due to an increase of $4.6 million in income taxes from foreign subsidiaries. A tax benefit associated with stock-based compensation of $100.0 million was offset by the provision of a valuation allowance of $100.0 million for deferred tax assets in the United States, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom. Our effective tax rate was (6.3)% and 1.2% of our net loss before taxes for the years ended April 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

Quarterly Trends in Revenue and Expense
Our quarterly total subscription revenue increased sequentially in each of the periods presented due to the expansion of our existing customer subscription footprint and an increase in the number of new customers. Historically, we have experienced quarterly fluctuations and seasonality based on the timing of entering into new agreements with customers, the timing of renewals, and the mix between annual and monthly contracts entered in each reporting period. Revenue trends are impacted by seasonality in our sales cycle which generally reflects a trend to greater revenue in our second and fourth quarters and lower revenue in our first and third quarters, though we believe this trend has been somewhat masked by our overall revenue growth. Because we generally invoice annually in advance for subscription agreements at least one year in duration, but we recognize the majority of the revenue ratably over the term of those agreements, a substantial portion of the revenue that we report in each period is attributable to the recognition of deferred revenue relating to subscriptions invoiced during previous periods. Consequently, increases or decreases in subscriptions in any one period typically will not be fully reflected in our revenue for that period and will positively or negatively affect our revenue in future periods. Accordingly, the effect of downturns in sales and market acceptance of our products may not be fully reflected in our results of operations until future periods. We may also experience greater variability and reduced comparability of our quarterly revenue and results with respect to timing and size of our monthly SaaS subscription contracts, particularly for smaller customers. The increase in professional services revenue was a result of an increase in standalone consulting and training services due to increased adoption of our offerings.
Our cost of revenue increased sequentially in each of the quarters presented, primarily driven by expanded adoption of Elastic Cloud by existing and new customers, which resulted in increased hosting costs, as well as growth in personnel costs as we grew our support and professional services teams.
Our total gross margin increased in the year ended April 30, 2021 due to an increase in our professional services margin, which may fluctuate, decline or be negative in the near-term as we seek to expand our professional services business.
We expect our revenue from Elastic Cloud to continue to increase as a percentage of total revenue, which may adversely impact our gross margin as a result of the associated hosting costs.
Our operating expenses generally increased sequentially over the periods presented as we grew the associated headcount and other costs.
We are subject to income taxes in the Netherlands, the United States, and numerous other jurisdictions. Our tax expense fluctuates between quarters primarily as a result of seasonally higher earnings in the second and fourth quarters and due to the impact of tax rates in foreign jurisdictions, and the relative amounts of income we earn in those jurisdictions.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
As of April 30, 2021, we had cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash of $400.8 million and $2.9 million, respectively, and working capital of $187.2 million. Our restricted cash constitutes cash deposits with financial institutions in support of letters of credit in favor of landlords for non-cancelable lease agreements.
We have generated significant operating losses from our operations as reflected in our accumulated deficit of $613.3 million as of April 30, 2021. We have historically incurred, and expect to continue to incur, operating losses and may generate negative cash flows from operations on an annual basis for the foreseeable future due to the investments we intend to make as described above, and as a result, we may require additional capital resources to execute on our strategic initiatives to grow our business.
We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund our operating and capital needs for at least the next 12 months, despite the uncertainty in the changing market and economic conditions related to COVID-19. Our assessment of the period of time through which our financial resources will be adequate to support our operations is a forward-looking statement and involves risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could vary as a result of, and our future capital requirements, both near-term and long-term, will depend on, many factors, including our growth rate, the timing and extent of spending to support our research and development efforts, the expansion of sales and marketing activities, the timing of new introductions of solutions or features, and the continuing market acceptance of our solutions and services. We may in the future enter into arrangements to acquire or invest in complementary businesses, services and technologies, including intellectual property rights. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could use our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect. We may be required to seek additional equity or debt financing. In the event that additional financing is required from outside sources, we may not be able to raise it on terms acceptable to us or at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital when desired, or if we cannot expand our operations or otherwise capitalize on our business opportunities because we lack sufficient capital, our business, operating results and financial condition would be adversely affected.
The following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods presented:
Year Ended April 30,
2021 2020 2019
(in thousands)
Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities
$ 22,545 $ (30,564) $ (23,937)
Net cash used in investing activities
$ (1,518) $ (29,187) $ (8,283)
Net cash provided by financing activities
$ 77,258 $ 58,539 $ 281,788
Net Cash Provided By (Used in) Operating Activities
Net cash provided by operating activities during the year ended April 30, 2021 was $22.5 million, which resulted from a net loss of $129.4 million adjusted for non-cash charges of $150.2 million and net cash inflow of $1.8 million from changes in operating assets and liabilities. Non-cash charges primarily consisted of $93.7 million for stock-based compensation expense, $41.0 million for amortization of deferred contract acquisition costs, $17.2 million of depreciation and intangible asset amortization expense and $7.9 million in non-cash operating lease costs, which were partially offset by net foreign currency transaction gains of $9.5 million and $0.1 million of other non-cash transactions. The net cash inflow from changes in operating assets and liabilities was the result of a $115.9 million increase in deferred revenue due to higher billings and a net increase of $7.2 million in accounts payable, accrued expenses and accrued compensation and benefits due to growth in our business and higher headcount. These inflows were partially offset by an increase of $24.0 million in accounts receivable due to higher billings and timing of collections from our customers, an increase in deferred contract acquisition costs of $81.1 million as our sales commissions increased due to the addition of new customers and expansion of our existing customer subscriptions, an increase of $8.3 million in prepaid and other assets and a decrease of $7.9 million in operating lease liabilities.
Net cash used in operating activities during the year ended April 30, 2020 was $30.6 million, which resulted from a net loss of $167.2 million adjusted for non-cash charges of $117.0 million and net cash inflow of $19.6 million from changes in operating assets and liabilities. Non-cash charges primarily consisted of $60.0 million for stock-based compensation expense, $28.3 million for amortization of deferred contract acquisition costs, $12.9 million of depreciation and intangible asset amortization expense, $8.8 million of non-cash acquisition expense, $7.4 million in non-cash operating lease costs and $1.1 million of other non-cash transactions which were partially offset by a $1.5 million increase in deferred income taxes. The net cash inflow from changes in operating assets and liabilities was the result of a $85.7 million increase in deferred revenue due to higher billings and a net increase of $30.9 million in accounts payable, accrued expenses and accrued compensation and benefits due to growth in our business and higher headcount, and a decrease of $2.7 million in prepaid and other assets. These inflows were partially offset by a $46.8 million increase in accounts receivable due to higher billings and timing of collections from our customers, an increase in deferred contract acquisition costs of $46.2 million as our sales commissions increased due to the addition of new customers and expansion of our existing customer subscriptions and a $6.7 million decrease in operating lease liabilities relating to the adoption of the new lease accounting standard.
Net Cash Used in Investing Activities
Net cash used in investing activities of $1.5 million during the year ended April 30, 2021 was primarily due $3.9 million of capital expenditures and capitalization of $0.3 million in internal-use software costs during the period, partially offset by cash provided by other investing activities of $2.7 million.
Net cash used in investing activities of $29.2 million during the year ended April 30, 2020 was primarily due to $24.4 million cash used for the acquisition of Endgame and $5.1 million of capital expenditures during the period.
Net Cash Provided by Financing Activities
Net cash provided by financing activities of $77.3 million during the year ended April 30, 2021 was due to proceeds from option exercises during the period.
Net cash provided by financing activities of $58.5 million during the year ended April 30, 2020 was due to $61.5 million proceeds from option exercises during the period, which was partially offset by payment of withholding taxes of $2.8 million for an acquisition-related expense that was settled in ordinary shares of the Company.
Off Balance Sheet Arrangements
We did not have, during the periods presented, nor do we currently have any off balance sheet financing arrangements or any relationships with any unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, including entities referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, that were established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes.
Contractual Obligations and Commitments
Our principal commitments consist of obligations under operating leases for office space and purchase obligations. The following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of April 30, 2021:
Total Less than
1 year 1-3 years 3-5 years More than
5 years
(in thousands)
Purchase obligations(1)
$ 348,478 $ 56,346 $ 182,132 $ 110,000 $ -

Total $ 379,502 $ 65,327 $ 196,280 $ 117,895 $ -
(1)Primarily consists of our purchase obligations under non-cancellable agreements for cloud hosting, subscription software, and sales and marketing. Actual payments under the cloud hosting capacity commitments may be higher than the total minimum depending on services used.
(2)Consists of future non-cancelable minimum rental payments under operating leases for our offices, excluding rent payments from our sub-tenants and variable operating expenses.
In addition to the contractual obligations set forth above, as of April 30, 2021, we had $2.1 million in letters of credit outstanding in favor of certain landlords for office space. These letters of credit renew annually and expire on various dates through 2023.
The contractual commitment amounts in the table above are associated with agreements that are enforceable and legally binding. Obligations under contracts that we can cancel without a significant penalty are not included in the table above.
Purchase orders issued in the ordinary course of business are not included in the table above, as our purchase orders represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements.
We have also excluded unrecognized tax benefits from the contractual obligations table above. A variety of factors could affect the timing of payments for the liabilities related to unrecognized tax benefits. Therefore, we cannot reasonably estimate the timing of such payments. We believe that these matters will likely not be resolved in the next 12 months and accordingly we have classified the estimated liability as non-current in the consolidated balance sheet. For further information see Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Critical Accounting Policies
We prepare our financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”). The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires certain estimates, assumptions and judgments to be made that may affect our consolidated financial statements. Accounting policies that have a significant impact on our results are described in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The accounting policies discussed in this section are those that we consider to be the most critical. We consider an accounting policy to be critical if the policy is subject to a material level of judgment and if changes in those judgments are reasonably likely to materially impact our results.
Revenue Recognition
We generate our revenue primarily from the sale of self-managed subscriptions (which include licenses for proprietary features, support, and maintenance) and SaaS subscriptions. We also generate revenue from professional services, which consist of consulting and training.
Under ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, we recognize revenue when our customer obtains control of promised products or services in an amount that reflects the consideration that we expect to receive in exchange for those goods or services. Our contracts include varying terms and conditions, and identifying and evaluating the impact of these terms and conditions on revenue recognition requires significant judgment. In determining the appropriate amount of revenue to be recognized as we fulfill our obligations under each of our agreements, we perform the following steps:
(i) identification of the contract with a customer;
We contract with customers through order forms, which in some cases are governed by master sales agreements. We determine that we have a contract with a customer when the order form has been approved, each party’s rights regarding the products or services to be transferred can be identified, the payment terms for the services can be identified, we have determined the customer has the ability and intent to pay, and the contract has commercial substance. We apply judgment in determining the customer’s ability and intent to pay, which is based on a variety of factors, including the customer’s historical payment experience or, in the case of a new customer, credit, reputation, and financial or other information pertaining to the customer. At contract inception we evaluate whether two or more contracts should be combined and accounted for as a single contract and whether the combined or single contract includes more than one performance obligation. We have concluded that our contracts with customers do not contain warranties that give rise to a separate performance obligation.
(ii) identification of the performance obligations in the contract;
Performance obligations promised in a contract are identified based on the products and services that will be transferred to the customer that are both capable of being distinct, whereby the customer can benefit from the products or services either on their own or together with other resources that are readily available from third parties or from us, and are distinct in the context of the contract, whereby the transfer of the products and services is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract.
Our self-managed subscriptions include both license providing the right to use proprietary features in our software, as well as an obligation to provide support (on both open source and proprietary features) and maintenance. Our SaaS products provide access to hosted software as well as support, which we consider to be a single performance obligation.
Services-related performance obligations relate to the provision of consulting and training services. These services are distinct from subscriptions and do not result in significant customization of the software.
(iii) determination of the transaction price;
The transaction price is the total amount of consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for the subscriptions and services in a contract. Variable consideration is included in the transaction price if, in our judgment, it is probable that a
significant future reversal of cumulative revenue under the contract will not occur. None of our contracts contain a significant financing component.
(iv) allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations; and
If the contract contains a single performance obligation, the entire transaction price is allocated to the single performance obligation. For contracts that contain multiple performance obligations, we allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation based on a relative standalone selling price (“SSP”). The SSP is determined based on the prices at which we separately sell these products assuming the majority of these fall within a pricing range. In instances where SSP is not directly observable, such as when we do not sell the software license separately, we derive the SSP using information that may include market conditions and other observable and unobservable inputs which can require significant judgment. There is typically more than one SSP for individual products and services due to the stratification of those products and services by quantity, term of the subscription, sales channel and other circumstances. If one of the performance obligations is outside of the SSP range, we allocate the transaction price considering the midpoint of the SSP range. We also consider if there are any additional material rights inherent in a contract, and if so, we allocate a portion of the transaction price to such rights based on a relative SSP.
(v) recognition of revenue when we satisfy each performance obligation.
Revenue is recognized at the time the related performance obligation is satisfied by transferring the promised product or service to the customer. Our self-managed subscriptions include both upfront revenue recognition when the license is delivered, as well as revenue recognized ratably over the contract period for support and maintenance based on the stand-ready nature of these subscription elements. Revenue from our SaaS products is recognized ratably over the contract period as we satisfy the performance obligation.
Professional services comprise consulting services as well as public and private training. Consulting services are generally time-based arrangements. Revenue from professional services is recognized as these services are performed.
We generate sales directly through our sales team and through our channel partners. Sales to channel partners are made at a discount and revenues are recorded at this discounted price once all the revenue recognition criteria above are met. To the extent that we offer rebates, incentives, or joint marketing funds to such channel partners, recorded revenues are reduced by this amount. Channel partners generally receive an order from an end-customer prior to placing an order with us. Payment from channel partners is not contingent on the partner’s collection from end-customers.
Contract Balances
The timing of revenue recognition may differ from the timing of invoicing to customers. For annual contracts, we typically invoice customers at the time of entering into the contract. For multi-year agreements, we generally invoice customers on an annual basis prior to each anniversary of the contract start date. We record unbilled accounts receivable related to revenue recognized in excess of amounts invoiced as we have an unconditional right to invoice and receive payment in the future related to those fulfilled obligations. Contract liabilities consist of deferred revenue which is recognized over the contractual period.
Deferred Contract Acquisition Costs
Deferred contract acquisition costs represent costs that are incremental to the acquisition of customer contracts, which consist mainly of sales commissions and associated payroll taxes. We determine whether costs should be deferred based on sales compensation plans, if the commissions are in fact incremental and would not have occurred absent the customer contract.
Effective May 1, 2019, we updated our sales commissions plan by incorporating different commission rates for contracts with new customers and incremental sales to existing customers, and for subsequent subscription renewals. Subsequent to this change, sales commissions for renewal of a subscription contract are not considered commensurate with the commissions paid for contracts with new customers and incremental sales to existing customers given the substantive difference in commission rates in proportion to their respective contract values. Commissions paid for contracts with new customers and incremental sales to existing customers are amortized over an estimated period of benefit of five years while commissions paid for renewal contracts are amortized based on the pattern of the associated revenue recognition over the related contractual renewal period for the pool of renewal contracts. We determine the period of benefit for commissions paid for contracts with new customers and incremental sales to existing customers by taking into consideration its initial estimated customer life and the technological life of its software and related significant features. Commissions paid on professional services are typically amortized in accordance with the associated revenue as the commissions paid on new and renewal professional services are commensurate with each other. Amortization of deferred contract acquisition costs is recognized in sales and marketing expense in the consolidated statement of operations.
We did not recognize any impairment of deferred contract acquisition costs during the years ended April 30, 2021, 2020 and 2019.
Stock-Based Compensation Expense
Compensation expense related to stock-based awards granted to employees is calculated based on the fair value of such awards on the date of grant. We determine the grant date fair value of the awards using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The related stock-based compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the period in which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the stock-based award, which is generally four years.
Our use of the Black-Scholes option pricing model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions, including the fair value of the underlying ordinary shares, the expected term of the option, the expected volatility of the price of our ordinary shares, risk-free interest rates and the expected dividend yield of our ordinary shares. The assumptions used to determine the fair value of the awards represent management’s best estimates. These estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management’s judgment.
These assumptions and estimates are as follows:
•Fair value of ordinary shares. See “Ordinary Share Valuations” below.
•Expected term. The expected term represents the period that our stock-based awards are expected to be outstanding. The expected term assumptions were determined based on the vesting terms, exercise terms and contractual lives of the options. For option grants that are considered “plain vanilla,” the expected term was estimated using the simplified method. The simplified method calculates the expected term as the midpoint between the vesting date and the contractual expiration date of the award.
•Expected volatility. Since we have a limited trading history of our ordinary shares, the expected volatility is derived from the average historical stock volatilities of several unrelated public companies within our industry that we consider to be comparable to its own business over a period equivalent to the option’s expected term.
•Risk-free interest rate. We base the risk-free interest rate used in the Black-Scholes option pricing model on the implied yield available on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with a remaining term equivalent to that of the options for each expected term.
•Dividend yield. The expected dividend assumption is based on our current expectations about our anticipated dividend policy. As we have no history of paying any dividends, we used an expected dividend yield of zero.
The following table summarizes the assumptions used in the Black-Scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of our stock options granted and assumed:
Year Ended April 30,
2021 2020 2019
Expected term (in years) 6.02 - 6.08 2.00 - 7.27 6.02 - 6.08
Expected stock price volatility 62.6% - 63.9% 54.8% 40.5% - 46.7%
Risk-free interest rate 0.4% - 1.1% 1.4% - 2.0% 2.4% - 3.1%
Dividend yield 0% 0% 0%
We will continue to use judgment in evaluating the assumptions related to our stock-based compensation on a prospective basis. As we continue to accumulate additional data related to our ordinary shares, we may refine our estimation process, which could materially impact our future stock-based compensation expense.
Prior to our IPO, we also assessed the need to record stock-based compensation expense when certain of our affiliated shareholders purchased shares from our employees and founders in excess of fair value of such shares. We recognized any such excess value as stock-based compensation expense in our consolidated statements of operations.
Ordinary Share Valuations
For valuations after the completion of the IPO, our compensation committee determines the fair value of the ordinary shares underlying equity awards based on the closing price of our ordinary shares as reported on the date of the grant. Our ordinary shares are publicly traded and are therefore subject to potentially significant fluctuations in the market price. Increases and decreases in the market price of our ordinary shares will also increase and decrease the fair value of our stock-based awards granted in future periods.
Prior to the completion of our IPO, the fair value of the ordinary shares underlying our equity awards was determined by our board of directors, after considering contemporaneous third-party valuations and input from management. The
valuations of our ordinary shares were determined in accordance with the guidelines outlined in the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Practice Aid, Valuation of Privately-Held-Company Equity Securities Issued as Compensation. In the absence of a public trading market, our board of directors, with input from management, exercised significant judgment and considered numerous objective and subjective factors to determine the fair value of our ordinary shares as of the date of each option grant, including the following factors:
•contemporaneous valuations performed at periodic intervals by unrelated third-party valuation firms;
•the prices, rights, preferences and privileges of our redeemable convertible preference shares relative to those of our ordinary shares;
•the lack of marketability of our ordinary shares;
•our actual and expected operating and financial performance;
•current business conditions and projections;
•our hiring of key personnel and the experience of our management;
•our history and the timing of the introduction of new products;
•our stage of development;
•the likelihood of achieving a liquidity event, such as an initial public offering or a merger or acquisition of our business given prevailing market conditions;
•the illiquidity of stock-based awards involving securities in a private company;
•the market performance of comparable publicly traded companies;
•secondary stock transactions, including a secondary stock purchase transaction that included certain of our employees, founders and certain of our affiliated shareholders; and
•U.S. and global capital markets conditions.
In valuing our ordinary shares, the fair value of our business, or enterprise value, was determined using both the income approach and market approach. The income approach estimates value based on the expectation of future cash flows that a company will generate. These future cash flows are discounted to their present values using a discount rate based on the capital rates of return for venture-backed early stage companies and is adjusted to reflect the risks inherent in our cash flows. The market approach estimates value based on a comparison of the company to comparable public companies in a similar line of business. From the comparable companies, a representative market value multiple is determined and then applied to the company’s financial results to estimate the value of the subject company.
The resulting equity value was then allocated to each class of stock using an option pricing methodology and Probability Weighted Expected Return Method or PWERM. The option pricing method is based on a binomial lattice model, which allows for the identification for a range of possible future outcomes, each with an associated probability. The option pricing method is appropriate to use when the range of possible future outcomes is difficult to predict and thus creates highly speculative forecasts. PWERM involves a forward-looking analysis of the possible future outcomes of the enterprise. This method is particularly useful when discrete future outcomes can be predicted at a relatively high confidence level with a probability distribution. Discrete future outcomes considered under the PWERM include an IPO, as well as non-IPO market based outcomes. Determining the fair value of the enterprise using the PWERM requires us to develop assumptions and estimates for both the probability of an IPO liquidity event and stay private outcomes, as well as the values we expect those outcomes could yield. We apply significant judgment in developing these assumptions and estimates, primarily based upon the enterprise value we determined using the income approach and market approach, our knowledge of the business and our reasonable expectations of discrete outcomes occurring. After the equity value is determined and allocated to the various classes of shares, a discount for lack of marketability, or DLOM, is applied to arrive at the fair value of ordinary shares. A DLOM is applied based on the theory that as an owner of a private company stock, the stockholder has limited opportunities to sell this stock and any such sale would involve significant transaction costs, thereby reducing overall fair market value.
Our assessments of the fair value of ordinary shares for grant dates between the dates of the valuations were based in part on the current available financial and operational information and the ordinary share value provided in the most recent valuation as compared to the timing of each grant. For financial reporting purposes, we considered the amount of time between the valuation date and the grant date to determine whether to use the latest ordinary share valuation. This determination included an evaluation of whether the subsequent valuation indicated that any significant change in valuation had occurred between the previous valuation and the grant date.
Acquisitions, Goodwill and Intangible Assets
We allocate the fair value of purchase consideration in a business combination to tangible assets, liabilities assumed and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is allocated to goodwill. The allocation of the purchase consideration requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. These estimates can include, but are not limited to, future expected cash flows from acquired customers and acquired technology from a market participant perspective, useful lives and discount rates. Management’s estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable, and, as a result, actual results may differ from estimates. During the measurement period, which is up to one year from the acquisition date, we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to earnings.
We assess goodwill for impairment at least annually, in the fourth quarter, and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. For the purposes of impairment testing, we have determined that we have one reporting unit. Our test of goodwill impairment starts with a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative goodwill impairment test. If qualitative factors indicate that the fair value of the reporting unit is more likely than not less than its carrying amount, then a quantitative goodwill impairment test is performed. For the quantitative analysis, we compare the fair value of our reporting unit to its carrying value and recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value.
Acquired intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives. We evaluate the recoverability of our intangible assets for possible impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. Recoverability of these assets is measured by a comparison of the carrying amounts to the future undiscounted cash flows the intangible assets are expected to generate. If such review indicates that the carrying amount of our intangible assets is not recoverable, the carrying amount of such assets is reduced to fair value.
Income Taxes
We are subject to income taxes in the Netherlands and numerous other jurisdictions including federal, state, and local jurisdictions in the United States and all other tax jurisdictions or countries in which we conduct business. Earnings from our non-Dutch activities are subject to local country income tax.
We follow the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. This method requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities. We assess whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized. We record a valuation allowance to our deferred tax assets to the extent we believe they are not more likely than not to be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income.
We recognize the tax benefit from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the tax authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefit is measured based on the largest benefit that is more likely than not of being realized upon ultimate settlement. We adjust reserves for our uncertain tax positions due to changing facts and circumstances. We recognize interest and penalties due to taxing authorities as a component of provision for income taxes.
We make estimates and judgments about our future taxable income based on assumptions that are consistent with our plans and estimates. Should the actual amounts differ from estimates, the amount of valuation allowance could be materially impacted. Any adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance would be recorded in the consolidated statement of operations for the periods in which the adjustment is determined to be required.","Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.
We have operations both within the United States and internationally, and we are exposed to market risk in the ordinary course of our business.
Interest Rate Risk
We had cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash of $403.7 million as of April 30, 2021. Our cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash are held in cash deposits and money market funds. The primary objectives of our investment activities are the preservation of capital, the fulfillment of liquidity needs and the fiduciary control of cash and investments. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes. Due to the short-term nature of these instruments, we do not believe that
an immediate 10% increase or decrease in interest rates would have a material effect on the fair market value of our investment portfolio. Declines in interest rates, however, would reduce our future interest income.
Foreign Currency Risk
Our revenue and expenses are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars. To date, we have not had a formal hedging program with respect to foreign currency, but we may do so in the future if our exposure to foreign currency should become more significant. For business conducted outside of the United States, we may have both revenue and costs incurred in the local currency of the subsidiary, creating a partial natural hedge. Changes to exchange rates therefore have not had a significant impact on our operating results to date; however, we will continue to reassess our foreign exchange exposure as we continue to grow our business globally.
We have experienced and will continue to experience fluctuations in net loss as a result of transaction gains or losses related to remeasurement of certain asset and liability balances that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the entities in which they are recorded. An immediate 10% increase or decrease in the relative value of the U.S. dollar to other currencies could have a material effect on our net loss. As a component of other income, net, we recognized a foreign currency transaction gain of $7.7 million and a foreign currency transaction loss of $2.2 million in the years ended April 30, 2021 and April 30, 2020, respectively.
As of April 30, 2021, our cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash were primarily denominated in U.S. dollars, Euros, and British pounds. A 10% increase or decrease in current exchange rates would have an impact of approximately $11.0 million on our cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash balances.
Inflation Risk
We do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.","Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.

Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Elastic N.V. and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of April 30, 2021 and 2020, and the related consolidated statements of operations, of comprehensive loss, of redeemable convertible preference shares and shareholders’ equity (deficit), and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended April 30, 2021, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of April 30, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of April 30, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended April 30, 2021 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of April 30, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.
Basis for Opinions
The Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Critical Audit Matters
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.
Revenue Recognition - Identification and Evaluation of Terms and Conditions in Contracts
As described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, management applies the following steps in their determination of revenue to be recognized: (i) identification of the contract with a customer; (ii) identification of the performance obligations in the contract; (iii) determination of the transaction price; (iv) allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations; and (v) recognition of revenue when the Company satisfies each performance obligation. The Company’s contracts include varying terms and conditions, and identifying and evaluating the impact of these terms and conditions on revenue recognition requires significant judgment. For the fiscal year ended April 30, 2021, the Company’s revenue was $608.5 million.
The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to revenue recognition, specifically the identification and evaluation of terms and conditions in contracts, is a critical audit matter are the significant judgment by management in identifying and evaluating terms and conditions in contracts that impact revenue recognition. This in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and in evaluating the audit evidence to determine whether terms and conditions in contracts were appropriately identified and evaluated by management.
Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the revenue recognition process, including controls related to the identification and evaluation of terms and conditions in contracts that impact revenue recognition. These procedures also included (i) testing the completeness and accuracy of management’s identification and evaluation of the specific terms with customers by examining revenue contracts on a sample basis and (ii) assessing the terms and conditions of the contract including their impact on revenue recognition.

1. Organization and Description of Business
Elastic N.V. (“Elastic” or the “Company”) was incorporated under the laws of the Netherlands in 2012. Elastic is a search company. It created the Elastic Stack, a powerful set of software products that ingest and store data from any source and in any format, and perform search, analysis, and visualization in milliseconds or less. Developers build on top of the Elastic Stack to apply the power of search to their data and solve business problems. The Company also offers software solutions built on the Elastic Stack: Enterprise Search, Observability, and Security. The Elastic Stack and the Company’s solutions are designed to run in public or private clouds, in hybrid environments, or in traditional on-premises environments.
Initial Public Offering
In October 2018, the Company completed its initial public offering (“IPO”) in which it issued and sold 8,050,000 ordinary shares at an offering price of $36.00 per share, including 1,050,000 ordinary shares pursuant to the exercise in full of the underwriters’ option to purchase additional shares. The Company received net proceeds of $263.8 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of $20.3 million and offering expenses of $5.7 million. Immediately prior to the completion of the IPO, all 28,939,466 shares of the Company’s then-outstanding redeemable convertible preference shares automatically converted into 28,939,466 ordinary shares at their respective conversion ratios and the Company reclassified $200.6 million from temporary equity to additional paid-in capital and $0.3 million to ordinary shares on its consolidated balance sheet.
The Company’s articles of association designated and authorized the Company to issue 72 million ordinary shares with a par value of €0.001 per share up until immediately prior to the completion of the IPO at which time the authorized ordinary shares increased to 165 million. In addition, the par value of ordinary shares was changed from €0.001 per share to €0.01 per share as required by Dutch law at the time of the Company’s conversion into a Dutch public company with limited liability (naamloze vennootschap).
2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Basis of Presentation
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) and include the financial statements of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All intercompany transactions and accounts have been eliminated in consolidation.
Fiscal Year
The Company’s fiscal year ends on April 30. References to fiscal 2021, for example, refer to the fiscal year ended April 30, 2021.
Use of Estimates and Judgments
The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Such estimates include, but are not limited to, allocation of revenue between recognized and deferred amounts, deferred contract acquisition costs, allowance for credit losses, valuation of stock-based compensation, fair value of ordinary shares in periods prior to the Company’s initial public offering, fair value of acquired intangible assets and goodwill, useful lives of acquired intangible assets and property and equipment, whether an arrangement is or contains a lease, the discount rate used for operating leases and valuation allowance for deferred income taxes. The Company bases these estimates on historical and anticipated results, trends and various other assumptions that it believes are reasonable under the circumstances, including assumptions as to future events.
In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the 2019 novel Coronavirus Disease (“COVID-19”) a pandemic. The pandemic is expected to result in a global slowdown of economic activity that is likely to decrease demand for a broad variety of goods and services, including from the Company’s customers, while also disrupting sales channels and marketing activities for an unknown period of time. The full extent to which COVID-19 may impact the Company’s financial condition or results of operations is uncertain.
Estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty and therefore require the exercise of judgment. As of the date of issuance of these financial statements, the Company is not aware of any specific event or circumstance that would require the Company to update its estimates, judgments or revise the carrying value of the Company’s assets or liabilities. These estimates may change, as new events occur and additional information is obtained,
and are recognized in the consolidated financial statements as soon as they become known. Actual results could differ from those estimates and any such differences may be material to the Company’s financial statements.
Foreign Currency
The reporting currency of the Company is the U.S. dollar. The Company determines the functional currency of each subsidiary in accordance with ASC 830, Foreign Currency Matters, based on the currency of the primary economic environment in which each subsidiary operates. Items included in the financial statements of such subsidiaries are measured using that functional currency. The Company periodically re-assesses its operations to determine if previous conclusions are still valid. Changes in functional currencies are applied prospectively if the operations encounter a significant and permanent change.
For the subsidiaries where the U.S. dollar is the functional currency, foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities are re-measured into U.S. dollars at current exchange rates and foreign currency denominated nonmonetary assets and liabilities are re-measured into U.S. dollars at historical exchange rates. Gains or losses from foreign currency re-measurement and settlements are included in other income (expense), net in the consolidated statement of operations. For the years ended April 30, 2021, 2020 and 2019, the Company recognized a re-measurement gain of $7.7 million, and re-measurement loss of $2.2 million and $0.2 million, respectively.
For subsidiaries where the functional currency is other than the U.S. dollar, the Company uses the period-end exchange rates to translate assets and liabilities, the average monthly exchange rates to translate revenue and expenses, and historical exchange rates to translate shareholders’ equity (deficit), into U.S. dollars. The Company records translation gains and losses in accumulated other comprehensive loss as a component of shareholders’ equity in the consolidated balance sheet.
Comprehensive Loss
The Company’s comprehensive loss includes net loss and unrealized gains and losses on foreign currency translation adjustments.
Cash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash
The Company considers all highly liquid investments, including money market funds with an original maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase, to be cash equivalents. The carrying amount of the Company’s cash equivalents approximates fair value, due to the short maturities of these instruments. Restricted cash represents cash on deposit with financial institutions in support of letters of credit in favor of certain landlords for non-cancelable lease agreements.
Cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash as reported in the Company’s consolidated statements of cash flows includes the aggregate amounts of cash and cash equivalents and the restricted cash as shown on the consolidated balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash as reported in the Company’s consolidated statements of cash flows consists of the following (in thousands):
As of April 30,
2021 2020
Cash and cash equivalents $ 400,814 $ 297,081
Restricted cash 2,894 2,308
Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash $ 403,708 $ 299,389
Short-Term Investments
Investments with an original maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase are considered cash equivalents, while all other investments are classified as short-term or long-term based on the nature of the investments, their maturities, and their availability for use in current operations. The Company determines the appropriate classification of its investments at the time of purchase and reevaluates such designation at each balance sheet date. Bank deposits with original maturities greater than three months but less than twelve months and are classified as short-term investments within current assets in the consolidated balance sheet. The Company had no short-term investments as of April 30, 2021 and April 30, 2020.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The Company’s financial instruments consist of cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and accrued liabilities. Cash equivalents are stated at amortized cost, which approximates fair value at the balance sheet dates, due to the
short period of time to maturity. Accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities are stated at their carrying value, which approximates fair value due to the short time to the expected receipt or payment date.
Assets and liabilities recorded at fair value on a recurring basis in the consolidated balance sheet consisting primarily of cash equivalents are categorized based upon the level of judgment associated with the inputs used to measure their fair values. Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Valuation techniques used to measure fair value must maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. The Company measures its financial assets and liabilities at fair value at each reporting period using a fair value hierarchy which requires the Company to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value:
•Level 1: Observable inputs, such as unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the measurement date.
•Level 2: Observable inputs, other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices in active markets for similar assets and liabilities, quoted prices in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.
•Level 3: Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.
The carrying values of the Company’s financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate their respective fair values due to the short period of time to maturity, receipt or payment.
Concentration of Credit Risk
Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk are primarily cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, short-term investments, and accounts receivable. The primary focus of the Company’s investment strategy is to preserve capital and meet liquidity requirements. The Company maintains its cash accounts with financial institutions where, at times, deposits exceed federal insurance limits. The Company invests its excess cash in highly-rated money market funds and in short-term investments. The Company extends credit to customers in the normal course of business. The Company performs credit analyses and monitors the financial health of its customers to reduce credit risk. Trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest. Management performs ongoing credit evaluations of customers and maintains allowances for potential credit losses on customers’ accounts when deemed necessary.
No customer represented 10% or more of net accounts receivable as of April 30, 2021, and one customer represented 10% of net accounts receivable as of April 30, 2020. No customer accounted for more than 10% of the Company’s total revenue for the years ended April 30, 2021, 2020 and 2019.
Accounts Receivable, Unbilled Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Credit Losses
Accounts receivable primarily consists of amounts billed currently due from customers. The Company’s accounts receivable are subject to collection risk. Gross accounts receivable are reduced for this risk by an allowance for credit losses. This allowance is for estimated losses resulting from the inability of the Company’s customers to make required payments. The Company determines the need for an allowance for credit losses based upon various factors, including past collection experience, credit quality of the customer, age of the receivable balance, and current economic conditions, as well as specific circumstances arising with individual customers. Accounts receivables are written off against the allowance when management determines a balance is uncollectible and the Company no longer actively pursues collection of the receivable.
The Company does not typically offer right of refund in its contracts. The allowance for credit losses reflects the Company’s best estimate of probable losses inherent in the Company’s receivables portfolio. As of April 30, 2021 and 2020, the allowance for credit losses was $2.3 million and $1.2 million, respectively. Activity related to the Company’s allowance for credit losses was as follows (in thousands):
Year ended April 30,

Ending balance $ 2,344 $ 1,247 $ 1,411
Unbilled accounts receivable represents amounts for which the Company has recognized revenue, pursuant to the Company’s revenue recognition policy, for fulfilled obligations, but not yet billed. The unbilled accounts receivable balance was $5.2 million and $2.6 million as of April 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
Capitalized Software Development and Implementation Costs
Software development costs for software to be sold, leased, or otherwise marketed are expensed as incurred until the establishment of technological feasibility, at which time those costs are capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers and amortized over the estimated life of the product. Technological feasibility is established upon the completion of a working prototype that has been certified as having no critical bugs and is a release candidate. To date, costs to develop software that is marketed externally have not been capitalized as the current software development process is essentially completed concurrently with the establishment of technological feasibility. As such, all related software development costs are expensed as incurred and included in research and development expense in the consolidated statement of operations.
Costs related to software acquired, developed, or modified solely to meet the Company’s internal requirements, with no substantive plans to market such software at the time of development and costs related to the development of web-based product are capitalized during the application development stage. Costs incurred during the preliminary planning and evaluation stage of the project and during the post implementation operational stage are expensed as incurred. Costs incurred during the application development stage of the project are capitalized. No costs were capitalized during the years ended April 30, 2021 and 2020.
The Company also capitalizes qualifying implementation costs incurred in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract based on the existing guidance for internally developed software. In accordance with the guidance, (i) capitalized implementation costs are classified in the same balance sheet line item as the amounts prepaid for the related hosting arrangement; (ii) amortization of capitalized implementation costs are presented in the same income statement line item as the service fees for the related hosting arrangement; and (iii) cash flows related to capitalized implementation costs are presented within the same category of cash flow activity as the cash flows for the related hosting arrangement (i.e. operating activity). The Company tests for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances occur that could impact the recoverability of these assets.
The Company amortizes capitalized implementation costs over the expected life of the service contract. The Company capitalized $0.3 million in implementation costs for software hosting arrangements during the fiscal year ended April 30, 2021. No such costs were capitalized during the fiscal year ended April 30, 2020. No amortization expense related to capitalized implementation costs was recorded during the fiscal years ended April 30, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively as the underlying implementation activities were not complete.
Property and Equipment
Property and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated over their estimated useful lives using the straight-line method. Upon retirement or sale, the cost of assets disposed of and the related accumulated depreciation are removed from the financial statements and any resulting gain or loss is reflected within the consolidated statement of operations. There was no material gain or loss incurred as a result of retirement or sale in the periods presented. Repair and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred.
Leases
Leases arise from contractual obligations that convey the right to control the use of identified property, plant or equipment for a period of time in exchange for consideration. The Company determines whether an arrangement is or contains a lease at inception, based on whether there is an identified asset and whether the Company controls the use of the identified asset throughout the period of use. At the lease commencement date, the Company determines the lease classification between finance and operating and recognizes a right-of-use asset and corresponding lease liability for each lease component. A right-of-use asset represents the Company’s right to use an underlying asset and a lease liability represents the Company’s obligation to make payments during the lease term. The operating lease right-of-use asset also includes any lease payments made and excludes lease incentives. Lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise that option. Lease expense for minimum lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The Company accounts for lease components and non-lease components as a single lease component.
The lease liability is initially measured as the present value of the remaining lease payments over the lease term. The discount rate used to determine the present value is the Company’s incremental borrowing rate unless the interest rate implicit in the lease is readily determinable. The Company estimates its incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at lease commencement date for borrowings with a similar term. The right-of-use asset is initially measured as the present value of the lease payments, adjusted for initial direct costs, prepaid lease payments to lessors and lease incentives.
Acquisitions
The Company has completed a number of acquisitions of other businesses in the past and may acquire additional businesses or technologies in the future. The results of businesses acquired in a business combination are included in the Company’s consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition. The Company allocates the purchase price, which is the sum of the consideration provided and may consist of cash, equity or a combination of the two, in a business combination to the identifiable assets and liabilities of the acquired business at their acquisition date fair values. The excess of the purchase price over the amount allocated to the identifiable assets and liabilities, if any, is recorded as goodwill. Determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires management to use significant judgment and estimates, including the selection of valuation methodologies, estimates of future revenue and cash flows, discount rates and selection of comparable companies.
When the Company issues stock-based or cash awards to an acquired company’s shareholders, the Company evaluates whether the awards are consideration or compensation for post-acquisition services. The evaluation includes, among other things, whether the vesting of the awards is contingent on the continued employment of the acquired company’s shareholders beyond the acquisition date. If continued employment is required for vesting, the awards are treated as compensation for post- acquisition services and recognized as expense over the requisite service period.
To date, the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the Company’s business combinations have primarily consisted of goodwill and finite-lived intangible assets, consisting primarily of developed technologies, in-process research & development, customer relationships and trade names. The estimated fair values and useful lives of identifiable intangible assets are based on many factors, including estimates and assumptions of future operating performance and cash flows of the acquired business, the nature of the business acquired, and the specific characteristics of the identified intangible assets. The estimates and assumptions used to determine the fair values and useful lives of identified intangible assets could change due to numerous factors, including market conditions, technological developments, economic conditions and competition. In connection with determination of fair values, the Company may engage independent appraisal firms to assist with the valuation of intangible and certain tangible assets acquired and certain assumed obligations.
Acquisition-related transaction costs incurred by the Company are not included as a component of consideration transferred, but are accounted for as an operating expense in the period in which the costs are incurred.
Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired in business combinations accounted for using the acquisition method for accounting and is not amortized. The Company tests goodwill for impairment at least annually, in the fourth quarter of each year, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that this asset may be impaired. For the purposes of impairment testing, the Company has determined that it has one operating segment and one reporting unit. The Company’s test of goodwill impairment starts with a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative goodwill impairment test. If qualitative factors indicate that the fair value of the reporting unit is more likely than not less than its carrying amount, then a quantitative goodwill impairment test is performed. For the quantitative analysis, the Company compares the fair value of its reporting unit to its carrying value. If the estimated fair value exceeds book value, goodwill is considered not to be impaired and no additional steps are necessary. However, if the fair value
of the reporting unit is less than book value, then under the second step the carrying amount of the goodwill is compared to its implied fair value. There was no impairment of goodwill recorded for the years ended April 30, 2021, 2020 and 2019.
Acquired Intangible Assets
Acquired amortizable intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets.

Trade names 4
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
The Company evaluates the recoverability of long-lived assets, including property and equipment and amortizable acquired intangible assets for possible impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be fully recoverable. Such events and changes may include: significant changes in performance relative to expected operating results, significant changes in asset use, significant negative industry or economic trends, and changes in the Company’s business strategy. Recoverability of these assets is measured by a comparison of the carrying amounts to the future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate. If such review indicates that the carrying amount of long-lived assets is not recoverable, the carrying amount of such assets is reduced to fair value. The Company determined that there were no events or changes in circumstances that indicated that its long-lived assets were impaired during the years ended April 30, 2021, 2020 and 2019.
In addition to the recoverability assessment, the Company periodically reviews the remaining estimated useful lives of property and equipment and amortizable intangible assets. If the estimated useful life assumption for any asset is changed, the remaining unamortized balance would be depreciated or amortized over the revised estimated useful life, on a prospective basis.
Deferred Offering Costs
Deferred offering costs were capitalized and consisted of fees and expenses incurred in connection with the sale of the Company’s ordinary shares in its IPO, including the legal, accounting, printing and other IPO-related costs. Upon consummation of the IPO in October 2018, $0.2 million of previously deferred offering costs along with additional offering costs of $5.5 million were reclassified to shareholders’ equity and recorded against the proceeds from the offering.
Revenue Recognition
The Company generates revenue primarily from the sale of self-managed subscriptions (which include licenses for proprietary features, support, and maintenance) and from the sale of SaaS subscriptions. The Company also generates revenue from professional services, which consist of consulting and training.
Under ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, the Company recognizes revenue when its customer obtains control of promised goods or services in an amount that reflects the consideration that the Company expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. The Company’s contracts include varying terms and conditions, and identifying and evaluating the impact of these terms and conditions on revenue recognition requires significant judgment. In determining the appropriate amount of revenue to be recognized as it fulfills its obligations under each of its agreements, the Company performs the following steps:
(i) identification of the contract with a customer;
The Company contracts with its customers through order forms, which in some cases are governed by master sales agreements. The Company determines that it has a contract with a customer when the order form has been approved, each party’s rights regarding the products or services to be transferred can be identified, the payment terms for the services can be identified, the Company has determined the customer has the ability and intent to pay and the contract has commercial substance. The Company applies judgment in determining the customer’s ability and intent to pay, which is based on a variety of factors, including the customer’s historical payment experience or, in the case of a new customer, credit, reputation and financial or other information pertaining to the customer. At contract inception the Company evaluates whether two or more contracts should be combined and accounted for as a single contract and whether the combined or single contract includes more than one performance obligation. The Company has concluded that its contracts with customers do not contain warranties that give rise to a separate performance obligation.
(ii) identification of the performance obligations in the contract;
Performance obligations promised in a contract are identified based on the products and services that will be transferred to the customer that are both capable of being distinct, whereby the customer can benefit from the products or services either on their own or together with other resources that are readily available from third parties or from the Company, and are distinct in the context of the contract, whereby the transfer of the products and services is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract.
The Company’s self-managed subscriptions include both license providing the right to use proprietary features in its software, as well as an obligation to provide support (on both open source and proprietary features) and maintenance. The Company’s SaaS products provide access to hosted software as well as support, which the Company considers to be a single performance obligation.
Services-related performance obligations relate to the provision of consulting and training services. These services are distinct from subscriptions and do not result in significant customization of the software.
(iii) determination of the transaction price;
The transaction price is the total amount of consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for the subscriptions and services in a contract. Variable consideration is included in the transaction price if, in the Company’s judgment, it is probable that a significant future reversal of cumulative revenue under the contract will not occur. None of the Company’s contracts contain a significant financing component.
(iv) allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations; and
If the contract contains a single performance obligation, the entire transaction price is allocated to the single performance obligation. For contracts that contain multiple performance obligations, the Company allocates the transaction price to each performance obligation based on a relative standalone selling price (‘SSP”). The SSP is determined based on the prices at which we separately sell these products assuming the majority of these fall within a pricing range. In instances where SSP is not directly observable, such as when we do not sell the software license separately, we derive the SSP using information that may include market conditions and other observable and unobservable inputs which can require significant judgment. There is typically more than one SSP for individual products and services due to the stratification of those products and services by quantity, term of the subscription, sales channel and other circumstances. If one of the performance obligations is outside of the SSP range, the Company allocates the transaction price considering the midpoint of the SSP range. The Company also considers if there are any additional material rights inherent in a contract, and if so, the Company allocates a portion of the transaction price to such rights based on a relative SSP.
(v) recognition of revenue when the Company satisfies each performance obligation;
Revenue is recognized at the time the related performance obligation is satisfied by transferring the promised product or service to the customer. The Company’s self-managed subscriptions include both upfront revenue recognition when the license is delivered as well as revenue recognized ratably over the contract period for support and maintenance based on the stand-ready nature of these subscription elements. Revenue on the Company’s SaaS products is recognized ratably over the contract period as the Company satisfies the performance obligation.
Professional services comprise consulting services as well as public and private training. Consulting services are generally time-based arrangements. Revenue from professional services is recognized as these services are performed.
The Company generates sales directly through its sales team and through its channel partners. Sales to channel partners are made at a discount and revenues are recorded at this discounted price once all the revenue recognition criteria above are met. To the extent that the Company offers rebates, incentives or joint marketing funds to such channel partners, recorded revenues are reduced by this amount. Channel partners generally receive an order from an end-customer prior to placing an order with the Company. Payment from channel partners is not contingent on the partner’s collection from end-customers.
Contract Balances
The timing of revenue recognition may differ from the timing of invoicing to customers. For annual contracts, the Company typically invoices customers at the time of entering into the contract. For multi-year agreements, the Company generally invoices customers on an annual basis prior to each anniversary of the contract start date. The Company records unbilled accounts receivable related to revenue recognized in excess of amounts invoiced as the Company has an unconditional right to invoice and receive payment in the future related to those fulfilled obligations. Contract liabilities consist of deferred revenue which is recognized over the contractual period.
Deferred Contract Acquisition Costs
Deferred contract acquisition costs represent costs that are incremental to the acquisition of customer contracts, which consist mainly of sales commissions and associated payroll taxes. The Company determines whether costs should be deferred based on sales compensation plans, if the commissions are in fact incremental and would not have occurred absent the customer contract.
During the fiscal year ended April 30, 2020, the Company updated its sales commissions plan by incorporating different commission rates for contracts with new customers and incremental sales to existing customers, and subsequent subscription renewals. Subsequent to this change, sales commissions for renewal of a subscription contract are not considered commensurate with the commissions paid for contracts with new customers and incremental sales to existing customers given the substantive difference in commission rates in proportion to their respective contract values. Effective May 1, 2019, commissions paid for contracts with new customers and incremental sales to existing customers are amortized over an estimated period of benefit of five years while commissions paid for renewal contracts are amortized based on the pattern of the associated revenue recognition over the related contractual renewal period for the pool of renewal contracts. The Company determines the period of benefit for commissions paid for contracts with new customers and incremental sales to existing customers by taking into consideration its initial estimated customer life and the technological life of its software and related significant features. Commissions paid on professional services are typically amortized in accordance with the associated revenue as the commissions paid on new and renewal professional services are commensurate with each other. Amortization of deferred contract acquisition costs is recognized in sales and marketing expense in the consolidated statement of operations.
The Company periodically reviews the carrying amount of deferred contract acquisition costs to determine whether events or changes in circumstances have occurred that could impact the period of benefit of these deferred costs.
Further disclosures with respect to the Company’s deferred contract acquisition costs are also included in Note 6, Balance Sheet Components.
Cost of Revenue
Cost of revenue consists primarily of costs related to providing subscription and professional services to the Company’s customers, including personnel costs (salaries, bonuses and benefits, and stock-based compensation) and related expenses for customer support and services personnel, as well as cloud infrastructure costs, third-party expenses, depreciation of fixed assets, amortization associated with acquired intangible assets, and allocated overhead.
Research and Development
Research and development costs are expensed as incurred and consist primarily of personnel costs, including salaries, bonuses and benefits, and stock-based compensation. Research and development costs also include depreciation and allocated overhead.
Advertising
Advertising costs are charged to operations as incurred or the first time the advertising takes place, based on the nature of the advertising, and include direct marketing, events, public relations, sales collateral materials and partner programs. Advertising costs were $16.7 million, $7.7 million and $6.5 million for the years ended April 30, 2021, 2020 and 2019 respectively. Advertising costs are recorded in sales and marketing expense in the consolidated statement of operations.
Stock-Based Compensation
Compensation expense related to stock awards issued to employees, including stock options, restricted stock awards (“RSAs”), and restricted stock units (“RSUs”) is measured at the fair value on the date of the grant and recognized over the requisite service period. The fair value of stock options is estimated on the date of the grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The fair value of RSAs and RSUs is estimated on the date of the grant based on the fair value of the Company’s underlying ordinary shares.
Compensation expense for stock options and RSUs is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. Compensation expense for RSAs is amortized on a graded basis over the requisite service period as long as the underlying performance condition is probable to occur. RSAs issued included a performance condition in the form of a specified liquidity event. The liquidity event condition was satisfied upon the effectiveness of the Company’s registration statement on Form S-1 (“IPO registration statement”), on October 4, 2018. On that date, the Company recorded a cumulative stock-based compensation expense of $1.7 million using the accelerated attribution method for all RSAs, for which the service condition had been fully satisfied as of October 4, 2018. The remaining unrecognized stock-based compensation expense
related to the RSAs was recorded over their remaining requisite service periods. The Company recognizes forfeitures as they occur.
Net Loss per Share Attributable to Ordinary Shareholders
The Company calculates basic net loss per share by dividing the net loss by the weighted-average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period, less shares subject to repurchase. Diluted net loss per share is computed by giving effect to all potentially dilutive ordinary share equivalents outstanding for the period, including stock options and restricted stock units.
Prior to the completion of the IPO in October 2018, the Company calculated basic and diluted net loss per share attributable to ordinary shareholders in conformity with the two-class method required for companies with participating securities. The Company considered all series of redeemable convertible preference shares and early exercised stock options to be participating securities as the holders were entitled to receive non-cumulative dividends on a pari passu basis in the event that a dividend was paid on ordinary shares. Under the two-class method, the net loss attributable to ordinary shareholders was not allocated to the redeemable convertible preference shares and early exercised stock options as the holders of redeemable convertible preference shares and early exercised stock options did not have a contractual obligation to share in losses.
Under the two-class method, basic net loss per share attributable to ordinary shareholders was calculated by dividing the net loss by the weighted-average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period, less shares subject to repurchase. Diluted net loss per share attributable to ordinary shareholders was computed by giving effect to all potentially dilutive ordinary shares outstanding for the period. For purposes of this calculation, redeemable convertible preference shares, stock options to acquire ordinary shares, contingently issuable shares, and early exercised stock options were considered potentially dilutive ordinary shares, but had been excluded from the calculation of diluted net loss per share attributable to ordinary shareholders as their effect was antidilutive.
Upon completion of the IPO, all shares of redeemable convertible preference shares then outstanding were automatically converted into an equivalent number of shares of ordinary shares on a one-to-one basis and their carrying amount reclassified into shareholders’ deficit. As of April 30, 2021, the Company did not have any redeemable convertible preference shares issued and outstanding.
Treasury Shares
Ordinary shares of the Company that are repurchased are recorded as treasury shares at cost and are included as a component of shareholders’ equity.
Segments
Operating segments are defined as components of an entity for which separate financial information is available and that is regularly reviewed by the Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”). The Company’s Chief Executive Officer is its CODM. The Company’s CODM reviews financial information presented on a consolidated basis for the purposes of making operating decisions, allocating resources and evaluating financial performance. As such, the Company has determined that it operates in one operating and one reportable segment. The Company presents financial information about its operating segment and geographical areas in Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements.
Income Taxes
The Company is subject to income taxes in the Netherlands and numerous foreign jurisdictions. These foreign jurisdictions may have different statutory rates than the Netherlands. The Company records a provision for income taxes for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations using the asset and liability method. Under this method, the Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and the tax basis of assets and liabilities, as well as for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the tax rates that are expected to apply to taxable income for the years in which those tax assets and liabilities are expected to be realized or settled. The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the net amount that it believes is more likely than not to be realized.
The calculation of the Company’s tax obligations involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations. ASC 740, Income Taxes, provides that a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes, on the basis of the technical merits. The Company has assessed its income tax positions and recorded tax benefits for all years subject to examination, based upon the Company’s evaluation of the facts, circumstances and information available at each period end. For those tax positions where the Company has determined there is a greater than fifty percent likelihood that a tax benefit will be sustained, the Company has recorded the largest amount of tax benefit that may potentially
be realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. For those income tax positions where it is determined there is less than fifty percent likelihood that a tax benefit will be sustained, no tax benefit has been recognized.
Although the Company believes that it has adequately reserved for its uncertain tax positions, the Company can provide no assurance that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be materially different. As the Company expands internationally, it will face increased complexity, and the Company’s unrecognized tax benefits may increase in the future. The Company makes adjustments to its reserves when facts and circumstances change, such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will affect the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made.
Customer Deposits
Certain of the Company’s contracts, acquired via the Endgame, Inc. (“Endgame”) acquisition, allow for termination at the customer’s convenience, or the Company may receive prepayments on master sales agreements. In these cases, the Company does not consider a contract to exist past the term in which enforceable rights and obligations exist. Amounts received related to these agreements are classified outside of deferred revenue in the consolidated balance sheet, and these amounts do not represent contract balances. As of April 30, 2021, the Company had $3.2 million of customer deposits included in accrued expenses and other liabilities. As of April 30, 2020, the Company had $2.6 million of customer deposits included in accrued expenses and other liabilities, and $8.5 million of non-refundable customer deposits included in other liabilities, non-current on the consolidated balance sheet.
Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements
Credit Losses: In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, and has since issued various amendments including ASU No. 2018-19, ASU No. 2019-4, and ASU No. 2019-5. The standard and related amendments modify the accounting for credit losses for most financial assets and requires an entity to utilize a new impairment model known as current expected credit loss (“CECL”) model to estimate its lifetime “expected credit loss” and record an allowance that, when deducted from the amortized costs basis of the financial asset, presents the amount expected to be collected on the financial asset. Additionally, ASU No. 2016-13 amends the current available-for-sale security impairment model for debt securities held for investment. The new model requires an estimate of expected credit losses when the fair value is below the amortized cost of the asset. The credit-related impairment (and subsequent recoveries) are recognized as an allowance on the balance sheet with a corresponding adjustment to the income statement. Non-credit related losses will continue to be recognized through OCI. This guidance also requires new disclosures for financial assets measured at amortized cost, loans and available-for-sale debt securities. Entities will apply the standard’s provisions as a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the first reporting period in which the guidance is adopted. The Company adopted ASU No. 2016-13 on May 1, 2020. The Company’s adoption of this ASU resulted in a $0.4 million reduction to accumulated deficit.
Goodwill Impairment: In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-4, Intangibles- Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment. The standard will simplify the measurement of goodwill impairment by eliminating step two of the two-step impairment test. Step two measures a goodwill impairment loss by comparing the implied fair value of a reporting unit’s goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. The new guidance requires an entity to compare the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount and recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value. Additionally, an entity should consider income tax effects from any tax-deductible goodwill on the carrying amount of the reporting unit when measuring the goodwill impairment loss, if applicable. The Company adopted ASU No. 2017-4 on May 1, 2020. The Company's adoption of this ASU did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.
Fair Value Measurements: In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-13, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820), which modifies, removes and adds certain disclosure requirements on fair value measurements based on the FASB Concepts Statement, Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting-Chapter 8: Notes to Financial Statements. The amendments on changes in unrealized gains and losses, the range and weighted average of significant unobservable inputs used to develop Level 3 fair value measurements and the narrative description of measurement uncertainty should be applied prospectively for only the most recent interim or annual period presented in the initial fiscal year of adoption. All other amendments should be applied retrospectively to all periods presented upon their effective date. The Company adopted ASU No. 2018-13 on May 1, 2020. The Company's adoption of this ASU did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.
Intangible Assets: In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-15, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other- Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40): Customer’s Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing
Arrangement That Is a Service Contract, which aligns the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract with the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred to develop or obtain internal-use software (and hosting arrangements that include an internal use software license). The accounting for the service element of a hosting arrangement that is a service contract is not affected by the amendments in this ASU. The Company adopted ASU No. 2018-15 on May 1, 2020 and applied it prospectively to implementation costs incurred after the date of adoption. The Company’s adoption of this ASU had no material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
New Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted
Income Taxes: In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes, eliminating certain exceptions to the general principles in ASC 740 related to intra-period tax allocation, deferred tax liability and general methodology for calculating income taxes. Additionally, the ASU makes other changes for matters such as franchise taxes that are partially based on income, transactions with a government that result in a step up in the tax basis of goodwill, separate financial statements of legal entities that are not subject to tax, and enacted changes in tax laws in interim periods. The new guidance becomes effective for the Company for the fiscal year ending April 30, 2022. Early adoption is permitted. The Company does not expect the adoption of the new accounting standard to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.
Equity Awards: In May 2021, the FASB issued ASU No. 2021-4, Earnings Per Share (Topic 260), Debt-Modifications and Extinguishments (Subtopic 470-50), Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718), and Derivatives and Hedging-Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Issuer’s Accounting for Certain Modifications or Exchanges of Freestanding Equity-Classified Written Call Options, which clarifies the accounting for modifications or exchanges of a freestanding equity-classified written call option that is not within the scope of another Topic. It addresses how an entity should treat, measure the effect of, and recognize the effect of a modification of the terms or conditions or an exchange of a freestanding equity-classified written call option that remains equity classified after modification or exchange. The new guidance becomes effective for the Company for the fiscal year ending April 30, 2023. Early adoption is permitted, including in interim periods. The Company does not expect the adoption of the new accounting standard to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.
Reclassification
In connection with the preparation of the Company’s consolidated financial statements for the year ended April 30, 2021, the Company identified an immaterial misclassification in the prior year balance sheet, which understated short term deferred revenue and overstated long term deferred revenue by $11.6 million as of April 30, 2020. The Company has corrected for this immaterial misclassification in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet by revising the April 30, 2020 deferred revenue balances. This change in classification has no effect on previously reported cash flows in the condensed consolidated statement of cash flows and has no effect on previously reported consolidated statements of operations for any period.

Remaining Performance Obligations
Remaining performance obligations represent the aggregate amount of the transaction price in contracts allocated to performance obligations not delivered, or partially undelivered, as of the end of the reporting period. Remaining performance obligations include deferred revenue and the unfulfilled portion of multi-year contracts or other orders not yet invoiced and certain unfulfilled orders against accepted customer contracts at the end of any given period.
As of April 30, 2021, the Company had $796.4 million of remaining performance obligations, which is comprised of product and services revenue not yet delivered. As of April 30, 2021, the Company expects to recognize approximately 85% of its remaining performance obligations as revenue over the next 24 months and the remainder thereafter.
4. Fair Value Measurements
The Company measures financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis at each reporting period using a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. A financial instrument’s classification within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
The following table summarizes assets that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of April 30, 2021 (in thousands):
Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total
Financial Assets:

Money market funds consist of cash equivalents with remaining maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase. The Company uses quoted prices in active markets for identical assets to determine the fair value of its Level 1 investments in money market funds.
5. Acquisitions
Fiscal 2020 Acquisition
Endgame, Inc.
On October 8, 2019, the Company acquired all outstanding shares of Endgame, a security company offering endpoint protection technology, for a total acquisition price of $234.0 million. Elastic paid the purchase price through (i) the issuance of 2,218,694 ordinary shares in respect of Endgame’s outstanding capital stock, warrants, convertible notes, and certain retention awards, (ii) the cash repayment of Endgame’s outstanding indebtedness of $20.4 million, (iii) the assumption of Endgame’s outstanding stock options, (iv) a $0.4 million cash deposit to an expense fund for the fees and expenses of the representative and agent of Endgame securityholders, (v) the cash payment of Endgame’s transaction expenses of $5.9 million, and (vi) the cash payment of withholding taxes related to acquisition expense settled in shares of $2.8 million. Approximately 11% of the ordinary shares issued, or 235,031 shares, were being held in an indemnity escrow fund for 18 months after the acquisition close date and were released in April 2021. For purposes of determining the total acquisition price of $234.0 million, the Company used the ordinary share price of $89.3836 which was determined on the basis of the volume weighted average price per share rounded to four decimal places for the twenty (20) consecutive trading days ending with the complete trading day ending five (5) trading days prior to the date upon which the acquisition was consummated.
The fair value of the shares transferred as consideration was $84.12 per share and was determined on the basis of the closing stock price of the Company’s ordinary shares on the date of acquisition. The fair value of the assumed stock options was determined by using a Black-Scholes option pricing model with the applicable assumptions as of the acquisition date.
The stock options assumed on the acquisition date will continue to vest as the Endgame employees provide services in the post-acquisition period. The fair value of these awards will be recorded as share-based compensation expense over the respective vesting period of each stock option.
The acquisition was accounted for as a business combination and the total purchase price was allocated to the net tangible and intangible assets and liabilities based on their respective fair values on the acquisition date and the excess was recorded as goodwill.
The following table summarizes the components of the U.S. GAAP purchase price and the allocation of the purchase price at fair value (in thousands):
Cash paid $ 26,633
Ordinary shares 178,331
Assumption of stock option plan 9,309
Total consideration $ 214,273
The above U.S. GAAP purchase price consideration does not include ordinary shares of Elastic issued as part of acceleration of equity awards and participation in the retention bonus pool.

Identifiable intangible assets include (in thousands):
Total Useful life (in years)
Developed technology $ 32,700 5
Customer relationships 19,200 4
Trade name 1,900 4
Intangible assets $ 53,800
Developed technology consists of software products and security platform developed by Endgame. Customer relationships consists of contracts with platform users that purchase Endgame’s products and services that carry distinct value. Trade names represent the Company’s right to the Endgame trade names and associated design, as it exists as of the acquisition date.
The fair value assigned to developed technology was determined primarily using the multi-period excess earnings model, which estimates the revenue and cash flows derived from the asset and then deducts portions of the cash flow that can
be attributed to supporting assets otherwise recognized. Management applied significant judgment in estimating the fair value of the developed technology intangible asset, which involved the use of significant estimates related to the revenue growth rate assumption for both existing and any future product offerings. The fair value of the Company’s customer relationships was determined using the income approach, which discounts expected future cash flows to present value using estimates and assumptions related to revenue and customer growth rate as determined by management. The fair value assigned to trade name was determined using the relief from royalty method, where the owner of the asset realizes a benefit from owning the intangible asset rather than paying a rental or royalty rate for use of the asset. The acquired intangible assets are being amortized on a straight-line basis over their respective useful lives, which approximates the pattern in which these assets are utilized.
Recognized goodwill of $178.8 million is not deductible for tax purposes and is primarily attributed to planned growth in new markets, synergies arising from the acquisition and the value of the acquired workforce.
Net tangible assets and liabilities assumed were valued at their respective carrying amounts as of the acquisition date, as the Company believes that these amounts approximate their current fair values.
Endgame has been included in the Company’s consolidated results of operations since the acquisition date. Endgame’s results were immaterial to the Company’s consolidated results for the year ended April 30, 2020.
The following unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial information gives effect to the acquisition of Endgame as if it were consummated on May 1, 2018, including pro forma adjustments related to the valuation and allocation of the purchase price, primarily amortization of acquired intangible assets and deferred revenue fair value adjustments; share-based compensation expense; alignment of accounting policies; the impact of applying ASC Topic 606, Revenue From Contracts With Customers, to Endgame’s historical financial statements; and direct transaction costs reflected in the historical financial statements. This data is presented for informational purposes only and is not intended to represent or be indicative of the results of operations that would have been reported had the acquisition occurred on May 1, 2018. It should not be taken as representative of future results of operations of the combined company (in thousands).

Non-recurring acquisition costs incurred by the Company of $17.5 million, including a non-cash expense settled in the Company’s ordinary shares for $8.8 million and a related cash payment of withholding taxes of $2.8 million, were charged to general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended April 30, 2020, and are reflected in the pro forma net loss presented above for the year ended April 30, 2019. Non-recurring acquisition costs incurred by Endgame of $1.5 million are also reflected in the pro forma net loss presented above for the year ended April 30, 2019.
Fiscal 2019 Acquisition
Lambda Lab Corp.
In July 2018, the Company acquired 100% of the share capital of Lambda Lab Corp. (“Lambda Lab”), a privately held company headquartered in the United States. Lambda Lab was a code search company whose product was built on top of Elasticsearch and focused on building semantic understanding of code, exposed through powerful search features. Purchase consideration for the acquisition was $2.0 million in cash. Excluded from the purchase consideration were 134,474 ordinary shares of $2.2 million issued to certain employees of Lambda Lab. These shares were subject to repurchase and were contingent upon these employees’ continued employment with the Company. As of April 30, 2020, no shares were subject to repurchase and all stock-based compensation expense had been recognized. During the years ended April 30, 2020 and 2019, the Company recorded stock-based compensation expense of $0.9 million and $1.4 million, respectively.
The following table summarizes the components of the Lambda Lab purchase price and the preliminary allocation of the purchase price at fair value (in thousands):
Cash paid $ 1,997
Developed technology $ 1,339
Trade name 15
Goodwill 1,038
Net liabilities acquired (395)
Total purchase consideration $ 1,997
The amount allocated to developed technology was $1.3 million. The fair value assigned to developed technology was determined primarily using the multi-period excess earnings model, which estimates the revenue and cash flows derived from the asset and then deducts portions of the cash flow that can be attributed to supporting assets otherwise recognized. The acquired developed technology is being amortized on a straight-line basis over four years, which approximates the pattern in which these assets are utilized.
Goodwill of $1.0 million, none of which is deductible for tax purposes, was recorded in connection with the Lambda Lab acquisition, which is primarily attributed to synergies arising from the acquisition and the value of the acquired workforce.
Acquisition costs of $0.2 million were charged to general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended April 30, 2019.
Lambda Lab has been included in the Company’s consolidated results of operations since the acquisition date.
Fair Value of Ordinary Shares Used for Purchase Consideration
The fair value of the ordinary shares issued as part of the consideration paid for the acquisitions prior to the Company’s IPO was determined by the Company’s board of directors based on numerous subjective and objective factors, including, but not limited to, a contemporaneous valuation performed by an independent third-party valuation firm. Because the Company was not publicly traded at the time the acquisitions were completed, the Company’s board of directors considered valuations of comparable companies, sales of redeemable convertible preference shares, sales of ordinary shares to unrelated third parties, operating and financial performance, the lack of liquidity of the Company’s ordinary shares, and general and industry-specific economic outlook, among other factors.

Letters of Credit
The Company had a total of $2.1 million in letters of credit outstanding in favor of certain landlords for office space as of April 30, 2021.
Legal Matters
From time to time, the Company has become involved in claims and other legal matters arising in the ordinary course of business. The Company investigates these claims as they arise. Although claims are inherently unpredictable, the Company is currently not aware of any matters that, if determined adversely to the Company, would individually or taken together have a material adverse effect on its business, results of operations, financial position or cash flows.
The Company accrues estimates for resolution of legal and other contingencies when losses are probable and reasonably estimable.
Although the results of litigation and claims are inherently unpredictable, the Company does not believe that there were any matters under litigation or claims with a reasonable possibility of the Company incurring a material loss as of April 30, 2021.
Indemnification
The Company enters into indemnification provisions under its agreements with other companies in the ordinary course of business, including business partners, landlords, contractors and parties performing its research and development. Pursuant to these arrangements, the Company agrees to indemnify, hold harmless, and reimburse the indemnified party for certain losses suffered or incurred by the indemnified party as a result of the Company’s activities. The maximum potential amount of future payments the Company could be required to make under these agreements is not determinable. The Company has never incurred costs to defend lawsuits or settle claims related to these indemnification agreements. As a result, the Company believes the fair value of these agreements is not material. The Company maintains commercial general liability insurance and product liability insurance to offset certain of the Company’s potential liabilities under these indemnification provisions.
In addition, the Company indemnifies its officers, directors and certain key employees while they are serving in good faith in their respective capacities. To date, there have been no claims under any indemnification provisions.

11. Equity Incentive Plans
In September 2012, the Company’s board of directors adopted and the Company’s shareholders approved the 2012 Stock Option Plan, which was amended and restated in September 2018 (as amended and restated, the “2012 Plan”). Under the 2012 Plan, the board of directors, the compensation committee, as administrator of the 2012 Plan, and a duly authorized committee may grant stock options and other equity-based awards, such as Restricted Stock Awards (“RSAs”) or Restricted Stock Units (“RSUs”), to eligible employees, directors, and consultants to attract and retain the best available personnel for positions of substantial responsibility, to provide additional incentive to employees, directors and consultants, and to promote the success of the Company’s business. The Company’s board of directors, compensation committee or a duly authorized committee determines the vesting schedule for all equity-based awards. Stock options granted to new employees under the 2012 Plan generally vest over four years with 25% of the option shares vesting one year from the vesting commencement date and then ratably over the following 36 months subject to the employees’ continued service to the Company. Refresh grants to existing employees generally vest monthly over four years subject to the employees continued service to the Company. RSUs granted to new employees generally vest over a period of four years with 25% vesting on the one-year anniversary of the vesting start date and the remainder vesting semi-annually over the next three years, subject to the grantee’s continued service to the Company. RSUs granted to existing employees generally vest semi-annually over a period of four years, subject to the grantee’s continued service to the Company. The Company’s compensation committee may explicitly deviate from the general vesting schedules in its approval of an equity-based award, as it may deem appropriate. Stock options expire ten years after the date of grant. Stock options, RSAs and RSUs that are canceled under certain conditions become available for future grant or sale under the 2012 Plan unless the 2012 Plan is terminated.
The equity awards available for grant for the periods presented were as follows:

RSUs
During the year ended April 30, 2021, the Company granted 1,965,644 RSUs at a weighted-average grant date fair value of $123.48 per unit.
During the year ended April 30, 2021, the Company cancelled 80,839 cash settled RSUs and contemporaneously granted 80,839 equity settled RSUs. The modification of the awards and related change in the classification of awards from liability-classified to equity-classified was accounted for under the provisions of ASC 718 - Stock Compensation. Prior to the conversion, the Company performed a final measurement of its stock-based compensation liability under the fair value method, which resulted in a non-cash stock-based compensation expense of $2.5 million. Additionally, upon modification of the awards, the Company reclassified $2.7 million stock-based compensation liability to additional-paid in capital.
As of April 30, 2021, the Company had unrecognized stock-based compensation expense of $286.8 million related to RSUs that the Company expects to recognize over a weighted-average period of 3.04 years.

Outstanding and unvested at April 30, 2021 3,301,283 $ 98.74
Determination of Fair Value
The determination of the fair value of stock-based options on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by the fair value of the Company’s ordinary shares, as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables. The Company uses the Black-Scholes option pricing model to calculate the fair value of stock options, which requires the use of assumptions including actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors, expected price volatility of the Company’s ordinary shares, the risk-free interest rate and expected dividends. Each of these inputs is subjective and generally requires significant judgment to determine.
Fair Value of Ordinary Shares: Prior to the IPO, the fair value of ordinary shares underlying the stock awards had historically been determined by the board of directors, with input from the Company’s management. The board of directors previously determined the fair value of the ordinary shares at the time of grant of the awards by considering a number of objective and subjective factors, including valuations of comparable companies, sales of redeemable convertible preference shares, sales of ordinary shares to unrelated third parties, operating and financial performance, the lack of liquidity of the Company’s ordinary shares, and general and industry-specific economic outlook. Subsequent to the IPO, the fair value of the underlying ordinary shares is determined by the closing price, on the date of the grant, of the Company’s ordinary shares, which are traded publicly on the New York Stock Exchange.
Expected Term: The expected term represents the period that options are expected to be outstanding. For option grants that are considered to be “plain vanilla,” the Company determines the expected term using the simplified method. The simplified method deems the term to be the average of the time-to-vesting and the contractual life of the options.
Expected Volatility: Since the Company has limited trading history of its ordinary shares, the expected volatility is derived from the average historical stock volatilities of several unrelated public companies within the Company’s industry that the Company considers to be comparable to its own business over a period equivalent to the option’s expected term.
Risk-Free Interest Rate: The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for zero-coupon U.S. Treasury notes with maturities approximately equal to the option’s expected term.
Dividend Rate: The expected dividend is assumed to be zero as the Company has never paid dividends and has no current plans to do so.
The Company’s expected volatility and expected term involve management’s best estimates, both of which impact the fair value of the option calculated under the Black-Scholes option pricing model and, ultimately, the expense that will be recognized over the life of the option.
The fair value of stock options granted and assumed was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions:
Year Ended April 30,
2021 2020 2019
Expected term (in years) 6.02 - 6.08
2.00 - 7.27

Since the Company is in a net loss position for all periods presented, basic net loss per share is the same as diluted net loss per share for all periods. The following outstanding potentially dilutive ordinary shares were excluded from the computation of diluted net loss per share attributable to ordinary shareholders for the periods presented because the impact of including them would have been antidilutive:

13. Income Taxes
The Company is incorporated in the Netherlands but operates in various countries with differing tax laws and rates. The geographical breakdown of income (loss) before provision for income taxes is summarized as follows (in thousands):
Year Ended April 30,
2021 2020 2019

Total deferred tax expense (income) 2,699 (1,926) 3,476
Total provision for (benefit from) income taxes $ 7,720 $ (1,968) $ 4,388
The Company’s effective tax rate substantially differed from the Dutch statutory tax rate of 25% primarily due to the valuation allowance on the Dutch, United States and United Kingdom deferred tax assets, partially offset by a tax benefit from stock-based compensation. A reconciliation of income taxes at the statutory income tax rate to the provision for income taxes included in the consolidated statement of operations is as follows (in thousands, except for rates):

Deferred Income Taxes
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities. Management assesses whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance where management has concluded it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income. Management makes estimates and judgments about future taxable income based on assumptions that are consistent with the Company’s plans and estimates.
Significant components of the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities are summarized as follows (in thousands):
As of April 30,
2021 2020
Deferred tax assets:
Accrued compensation $ - $ 3,267

The deferred tax assets and liabilities disclosure at April 30, 2020 has been adjusted to reflect the deferred tax right-of-use asset and related deferred lease liability recognized in accordance with ASC 842.
The valuation allowance for deferred tax assets as of April 30, 2021 and 2020 was $409.8 million and $225.2 million, respectively. As the Company has generated losses since inception in the Netherlands and California (United States) jurisdictions, management maintains a full valuation allowance against the net deferred tax assets in these jurisdictions. In addition, the United States and the United Kingdom jurisdictions are anticipated to have cumulative losses for the foreseeable future, and as such a valuation allowance has been established for these regions. The valuation allowance in the Netherlands, the United States and the United Kingdom jurisdictions increased by $61.0 million, $113.1 million and $10.5 million, respectively, during the year ended April 30, 2021 and $35.3 million, $94.5 million and $3.1 million, respectively, for the year ended April 30, 2020. The valuation allowance for the Dutch deferred tax assets as of April 30, 2021 and 2020 was $149.4 million and $88.4 million, respectively, the valuation allowance for the United States deferred tax assets as of April 30, 2021 and 2020 was $246.0 million and $132.9 million, respectively, and the valuation allowance for the United Kingdom deferred tax assets as of April 30, 2021 and April 30, 2020 was $14.4 million and $3.9 million, respectively.
As of April 30, 2021, the Company had net operating loss (“NOL”) carryforwards for Dutch, United States (Federal and State) and United Kingdom income tax purposes of $589.8 million, $936.1 million, $642.0 million and $56.0 million, respectively, which begin to expire in the year ending April 30, 2022, April 30, 2031 and April 30, 2024, respectively, with United Kingdom losses being carried forward indefinitely. The Company also has research and development tax credit carryforwards for United States (Federal and State) and Canada, income tax purposes of $15.9 million, $4.3 million and $0.5 million respectively, which begin to expire April 30, 2030, April 30, 2022, and April 30, 2037, respectively. Research and development tax credit carryforwards related to the UK of $0.6 million have an indefinite life. The deferred tax assets associated with the NOL carryforwards and other tax attributes in the Netherlands, the United States, and the United Kingdom are subject to a full valuation allowance.
On March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (the “CARES Act”) Act was signed into United States law. The Act provides emergency assistance, opportunities for additional liquidity and other government programs to support individuals, families and businesses affected by the 2020 coronavirus pandemic, in part through amending United States tax law. Previously limited to 80% of taxable income by the TCJA, section 172(a), the CARES Act removes the limitation and grants taxpayers a five-year carryback period for NOLs arising in tax years beginning after December 31, 2017 and before January 1, 2021. Due to significant losses in the year ended April 30, 2019, and as a result of the CARES Act, the Company has filed amended returns to carry back the NOLs from the year ended April 30, 2019 back to five previous fiscal
years (April 30, 2014 - April 30, 2018) to fully offset the taxable income in those tax years with an estimated income tax benefit of $3.3 million in the year ended April 30, 2020.
Uncertain Tax Positions
The calculation of the Company’s tax obligations involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations. ASC 740, Income Taxes, provides that a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes, on the basis of the technical merits. The Company has assessed its income tax positions and recorded tax benefits for all years subject to examination, based upon the Company’s evaluation of the facts, circumstances and information available at each period end.
Although the Company believes that it has adequately reserved for its uncertain tax positions, the Company can provide no assurance that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be materially different. As the Company expands, it will face increased complexity, and the Company’s unrecognized tax benefits may increase in the future. The Company makes adjustments to its reserves when facts and circumstances change, such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will affect the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made.
The Company had unrecognized tax benefits of $13.7 million as of April 30, 2021, of which none would impact the effective tax rate before consideration of any valuation allowance. The activity within the Company’s unrecognized gross tax benefits is summarized as follows (in thousands):
As of April 30,
2021 2020 2019
Balance as of beginning of year $ 9,706 $ 3,870 $ 2,019
Increase related to tax positions taken in prior periods 432 2,283 240
Increase related to tax positions taken in the current period 3,518 3,553 1,611
Balance as of end of year $ 13,656 $ 9,706 $ 3,870
Approximately $0.4 million of the increase in fiscal 2021 for tax positions taken in prior periods is due to the filing of tax returns during the current fiscal year. Approximately $3.5 million of the increase in tax positions related to the current period is from the research and development tax credits generated for fiscal 2021.
The Company’s policy is to recognize penalties and interests accrued on any unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense. During each of the years ended April 30, 2021, 2020 and 2019 the Company recognized less than $0.1 million of interest and penalties. The amount of accrued interest and penalties recorded on the consolidated balance sheet as of April 30, 2021 and 2020 was $0.1 million and $0.2 million, respectively.
The Company is subject to periodic examination of income tax returns by various domestic and international tax authorities. During the fiscal year, the Company closed its income tax and VAT audit with the Dutch tax authority for the tax years ended April 30, 2015 to April 30, 2017 and its income tax and VAT audit with the German tax authority for the tax years ended April 30, 2016 to April 30, 2018. There were no material adjustments as a result of these audit settlements. The Company is currently under examination with the Internal Revenue Service for foreign withholding taxes for the calendar year 2018.
The Company does not anticipate any significant increases or decreases in its uncertain tax positions within the next twelve months. The Company files tax returns in multiple jurisdictions, including the Netherlands and United States. The Company’s tax filings for fiscal years starting with the year ended April 30, 2016 remain open in various tax jurisdictions. If the examinations are resolved unfavorably, there is a possibility they may have a material negative impact on its results of operations.
Dutch income taxes and non-Dutch withholding taxes associated with the repatriation of earnings or for temporary differences related to investments in non-Dutch subsidiaries, excluding the U.S subsidiaries, have not been provided for, as the Company intends to reinvest the earnings of such subsidiaries indefinitely or the Company has concluded that an immaterial additional tax liability would arise on the distribution of such earnings. Earnings from the Company’s U.S. subsidiaries are being treated as being currently repatriated back to the Netherlands though no Dutch income taxes nor U.S. withholding taxes in regard to such repatriations are being recorded due to the Dutch participation exemption provisions and exemption from withholding taxes under the income tax treaty between the Netherlands and the United States. At April 30, 2021, there were cumulative earnings of $75.1 million, from the non-U.S. subsidiaries. If such earnings were to be repatriated they would be exempt from taxation in the Netherlands and the amount of dividend withholding taxes from such foreign jurisdictions would be $1.8 million, due to the various income tax treaties between the Netherlands and the respective foreign jurisdictions.
The Company is subject to Global Intangible Low Taxed Income (“GILTI”). Due to the Company’s net operating loss, GILTI provision was $1.0 million, zero and $0.5 million and did not have a material impact on the Company’s results for the years ended April 30, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
14. Employee Benefit Plans
The Company has a defined-contribution plan in the U.S. intended to qualify under Section 401 of the Internal Revenue Code (the “401(k) Plan”). The Company has contracted with a third-party provider to act as a custodian and trustee, and to process and maintain the records of participant data. Substantially all the expenses incurred for administering the 401(k) Plan are paid by the Company. This 401(k) Plan covers substantially all employees who meet minimum age and service requirements and allows participants to defer a portion of their annual compensation on a pre-tax basis The Company makes contributions to the 401(k) Plan up to 6% of the participating employee’s W-2 earnings and wages. The Company recorded $11.4 million, $8.3 million and $5.0 million of expense related to the 401(k) Plan during the years ended April 30, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
The Company also has defined-contribution plans in certain other countries for which the Company recorded $5.1 million, $3.6 million and $1.9 million of expense during the years ended April 30, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
We maintain “disclosure controls and procedures,” as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange
Act) as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Based on such evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that as of April 30, 2020, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act (a) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the SEC rules and forms and (b) is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate “internal control over financial reporting,” as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and Rule 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Our management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of April 30, 2021 based on the criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
Based on the results of its evaluation, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of April 30, 2021. The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of April 30, 2021 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in its report which is included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by Rule 13a-15(d) and 15d-15(d) of the Exchange Act that occurred during the quarter ended April 30, 2020 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls
Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, believes that our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and are effective at the reasonable assurance level. However, our management does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.","Item 9B. Other Information.

BUSINESS
General
The Company is structured as a holding company with a business strategy focused on owning subsidiaries engaged in a number of diverse business activities. We are not a “blank check company” as defined in Rule 419 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”). We conduct and plan to continue to conduct our activities in such a manner as not to be deemed an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company Act”). Therefore, no more than 40% of our total assets can be invested in investment securities, as such term is defined in the Investment Company Act. In addition, we do not invest or intend to invest in securities as our primary business. Your rights as a holder of shares, and the fiduciary duties of the Company’s Board of Directors and executive officers, and any limitations relating thereto are set forth in the documents governing the Company and may differ from those applying to a Delaware corporation. However, the documents governing the Company specify that the duties of its directors and officers will be generally consistent with the duties of a director of a Delaware corporation.
The Company’s Board of Directors will oversee the management of the Company and our businesses. Initially, the Company’s Board of Directors will be comprised of seven (7) directors, with five (5) of those directors appointed by holders of the Company’s Class A common stock and two (2) of those directors appointed by holders of the Company’s Class B common stock, and at least five (5) of whom will be the Company’s independent directors.
We have accumulated a deficit of $11,030,550 as of December 31, 2020 and will likely require significant additional capital to implement our business plan.
Business Strategy and Core Strengths
We anticipate that the operating businesses we acquire will be managed on a decentralized basis with essentially no centralized or integrated business functions (such as sales, marketing, purchasing, legal or human resources) and minimal involvement by the Company’s corporate senior management teams in the day-to-day business activities of the operating businesses. The Company’s corporate senior management team anticipates that it will participate in and have ultimate responsibility for significant decisions, such as capital allocation, investment activities and the selection of a chief executive officer for each of the operating businesses. We will also be responsible for establishing, implementing and monitoring corporate governance policies and practices, including those at the operating businesses, and participating in the resolution of governance-related issues as needed.
We expect that our business activities at the holding company level will be are managed by a small senior corporate management team, who will research and identify attractive investment opportunities; delegate responsibilities to competent and motivated managers; set operating subsidiary goals; assist managers in the achievement of those goals; define risk parameters; develop appropriate incentive programs; and monitor progress against long-term objectives.
We believe that our outlook on length of ownership and active management on our part may alleviate the concern that many stakeholders in potential control transactions may have with regard to their businesses going through multiple sale processes in a short period of time. We believe this outlook reduces both the risk that securities or whole businesses may be sold at unfavorable points in the overall market cycle and enhances our ability to develop a comprehensive strategy to grow the earnings and cash flows of each of our businesses, which we expect will better enable us to meet our long-term corporate objectives of increasing shareholder value.
Our objective is to grow intrinsic value per share at an attractive rate by retaining capital to reinvest in the productive capabilities of our current subsidiaries, make opportunistic investments, and/or invest in new, anticipated durable earnings streams. Each of these options for capital will be compared to one another on a regular basis, and capital will be deployed according to our management’s judgment as to where it believes allocated capital has the potential to achieve the best long-term return.
Investment Strategy
We will seek to focus on acquiring operating businesses and securities that (a) can be purchased at what we believe to be a fair price relative to intrinsic value, (b) are managed by competent and incentivized management teams, (c) offer reasonable downside protection and (d) directly contribute to the Company’s strategic goals. Over time, we believe that a focus on these objectives should allow us to consistently deliver targeted investment returns that outperforms the broader market. We plan to target investments into businesses that we believe (i) operate in industries with stable long-term operating profiles, (ii) present a stable unlevered free cash flow profile, (iii) have the ability to quickly adapt to changing economic cycles and (iv) face minimal threats of technological or competitive obsolescence.
We believe that an investment strategy focused on investments with these character traits coupled with a value investing orientation should continue to present attractive investment opportunities that allow us to build a less correlated portfolio of operating assets that provide shareholders with exposure to a mix of growth and acyclical operating assets that allow us to maximize shareholder value.
Management Strategy
Our management strategy involves the financial and operational management of the businesses that we anticipate acquiring in a manner that seeks to grow earnings and cash flow and, in turn increasing stockholder value. In general, we plan to oversee and support the management team of each of our businesses by, among other things:
● recruiting and retaining talented managers to operate our businesses by using structured incentive compensation programs, including minority equity ownership, tailored to each business;
● regularly monitoring financial and operational performance, instilling consistent financial discipline, and supporting management in the development and implementation of information systems to effectively achieve these goals:
● assisting management in their analysis and pursuit of prudent organic growth strategies:
● identifying and working with management to execute on attractive external growth and acquisition opportunities; and
● forming strong subsidiary level boards of directors to supplement management in their development and implementation of strategic goals and objectives
Our investment strategy centers around our ability to consistently seek to acquire securities and/or companies at a discount to intrinsic value as determined by various metrics, including without limitation, replacement cost, break-up value, cash flow and earnings power and liquidation value.
We utilize a process-oriented, research-intensive, value-based investing approach. This approach generally involves three (3) critical steps: (i) fundamental credit, valuation, capital structure and security analysis; (ii) intense analysis of fulcrum issues, such as litigation, taxes and regulation, that often affect valuation; and (iii) a deep understanding and analysis of contextual factors that often affect the risk-adjusted attractiveness of an investment position. This approach focuses on exploiting market price dislocations that create attractive buying opportunities. These dislocations may be caused by such factors as broad-based market drawdowns; busted auction processes; out of favor, short term industry perceptions; market euphoria; litigation; complex contingent liabilities; corporate malfeasance and weak corporate governance; general bearish economic conditions; and / or complex and inappropriate capital structures.
While we plan to principally focus on deploying a material portion of our investable capital into acquiring controlling interests in privately held and/or thinly traded middle market operating businesses, we may employ a number of acquisition strategies and are permitted to invest across a variety of industries and types of securities including: (i) publicly traded equities; (ii) publicly traded bonds and privately issued, non-investment grade debt, bank debt and other corporate obligations; and (iii) privately issued and publicly traded structured equity and other preferred equity securities.
Key Elements of Our Strategy:
The key elements of our business strategy include the following:
● Seek to Acquire Undervalued Assets. We intend to make investments in businesses that we believe are undervalued and have potential for growth. We will also seek to capitalize on investment opportunities arising from market inefficiencies, economic or market trends that have not been identified and reflected in market value, or complex or special situations. Certain opportunities may arise from companies/assets that experience busted sell-side auction processes, disappointing financial results, liquidity or capital needs, lowered credit ratings, revised industry forecasts or legal complications. We may acquire businesses or assets directly or we may establish an ownership position through the purchase of debt or equity securities in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions.
● Utilize a Low-Cost Model. We believe our low overhead model will allow us to more effectively utilize excess cash flows from our portfolio of operating businesses and securities to enhance stockholder through efficient capital allocation activities.
● Internal Resources and External Network Sufficient to Drive Accretive Opportunities. We believe our internal management team and their strong relationships with industry executives, accountants, attorneys, business brokers, commercial and investment bankers, and other potential sources of acquisition opportunities offer us a strong pipeline of opportunities. Additionally, the flexibility, creativity, experience and expertise of our management team in structuring transactions allows us to consider non-traditional and complex transactions tailored to fit a specific acquisition target.
● Drive Accountability and Financial Discipline in the Management of our Business. Our management team is accountable directly to our board of directors and has day-to-day responsibility for general oversight of our business and for capital allocation decisions of our operating businesses. We continually evaluate our operating subsidiaries with a view towards maximizing value and cost efficiencies, bringing an owner’s perspective to our operating businesses. In each of these businesses, we will look for senior management teams with the expertise to run their businesses and boards of directors to oversee the management of those businesses. Each management team will be responsible for the day-to-day operations of its businesses and directly accountable to its board of directors.
Competition
In our core business, which is the acquisition of operating businesses and securities, we face intense competition, including competition from companies with significantly greater resources than us, and if we are unable to compete effectively with these companies, our market share may decline, and our business could be harmed.
Employees
As of the date of this report, we had six (6) employees. We believe that our relationship with our employees is good.
Potential Effects of the COVID-19 Pandemic on our Business
The adverse public health developments and economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States could adversely affect the Company’s business. Particularly, the COVID-19 pandemic could potentially lead to an extended economic downturn, which would likely make it more difficult to identify and acquire potential candidates, as well as limit the availability of acquisition financing. The Company cannot accurately predict the effect the COVID-19 pandemic will have on the Company.
Corporate Information
The Company was originally incorporated in the State of Nevada on June 4, 2012 under the name Snap Online Marketing, Inc. We changed our name on January 31, 2014 to LifeLogger Technologies Corp. and on April 10, 2019, we reincorporated in Delaware under the name Capital Park Holdings Corp. On December 19, 2019, we changed our name to Bridgeway National Corp. Our executive offices are located at 1015 15th Street NW, Suite 1030, Washington DC 20005 and our telephone number is (202) 846-7689.
Change in Control Transaction
On January 9, 2019, the Company entered into a Note Conversion Agreement (the “Conversion Agreement”) with SBI Investments LLC, 2014-1, a statutory series of Delaware limited liability corporation (“SBI”), and Old Main Capital, LLC, a Florida series limited liability corporation (“Old Main”). Pursuant to the Conversion Agreement, SBI converted $549,042 of principal and $641,565 accrued interest owed to SBI by the Company pursuant to a promissory Note into 42,429 shares of the Company’s Series B Preferred Stock, par value $0.001 per share (the “Series B Preferred Stock”), in full satisfaction of such obligation. Pursuant to the Conversion Agreement, Old Main converted $556,547 of principal and $650,094 accrued interest owed to Old Main by the Company pursuant to a promissory Note into 54,000 shares of the Company’s Series B Preferred Stock in full satisfaction of such obligation. Concurrently with and the closing of the transactions for the Old Main Conversion Shares, with an effective date of January 9, 2019, the Company acquired from Old Main and SBI 83,796 shares of Class A Common Stock and from a prior executive of the Company, 1,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock. The purchase price for the Class A Common Stock was $335.18 in the aggregate and the purchase price for the Series A Preferred Stock was $1 in the aggregate. During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company declared $39,391 in dividends on the Series B Preferred Stock, of which $28,073 was paid in cash by a related party and $11,318 accrued. During the year ended December 31,2020, the Company declared $43,048 in dividends on the Series B Preferred Stock of which $0 was paid in cash, $43,048 was accrued.
Contemporaneously with the share sale and purchase transaction, Stewart Garner resigned as the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and director and Eric C .Blue, a principal of the Fund was appointed as the Company’s Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer, Chief Investment Officer and a director. Moreover, we changed our business focus from the development of proprietary cloud-based software programs to our current business of acquiring majority or minority interests in operating businesses.
As a result of the foregoing transaction, a “change in control” of the Company was deemed to have taken place (the “Change in Control Transaction”).
Recent Developments
Equity Purchase Agreement
On October 24, 2019, the Company entered into an equity purchase agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) with SBI Investments LLC, 2014-1, a statutory series of Delaware limited liability company (“SBI”) and Oasis Capital, LLC, a Puerto Rico limited liability company (“Oasis” and together with SBI, the “Equity Purchasers”), pursuant to which the Equity Purchasers agreed to, in the aggregate between them, purchase from the Company, up to $10,000,000 (the “Maximum Commitment Amount”) of our share of common stock.
Under the terms of the Purchase Agreement, the Company has the right, but not the obligation, to direct an Equity Purchaser, by its delivery of a put notice (the “Put Notice”) from time to time beginning on the execution date of the Purchase Agreement and ending on the earlier to occur of (a) the date on which the Equity Purchasers shall have purchased Put Shares equal to the Maximum Commitment Amount, (b) October 24, 2021 or (c) written notice of termination by the Company to the Equity Purchasers (together, the “Commitment Period”), to purchase Put Shares (as defined below).
Notwithstanding any other terms of the Purchase Agreement, in each instance (a) the amount that is the subject of a Put Notice (the “Investment Amount”) is not more than the Maximum Put Amount (as defined below), (b) the aggregate Investment Amount of all Put Notices shall not exceed the Maximum Commitment Amount and (b) the Company cannot deliver consecutive Put Notices and/or consummate closings to the same Equity Purchaser and must alternate between Oasis and SBI. “Maximum Put Amount” means the lesser of (a) such amount that equals 250% of the average daily trading volume of our shares and (b) $1,000,000. The price paid for each share (the “Purchase Price”) subject to a Put Notice (the “Put Shares”) shall be 85% of the Market Price (as defined below) on the date upon which the Purchase Price is calculated in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Purchase Agreement. “Market Price” means the one lowest traded price of the shares on the principal market for any trading day during the Valuation Period (as defined below), as reported by Bloomberg Finance L.P. or other reputable source. “Valuation Period” means the period of five consecutive trading days immediately following the Clearing Date (as defined below) associated with the applicable Put Notice during which the Purchase Price of the shares is valued, provided, however, that the Valuation Period shall instead begin on the Clearing Date if the respective Put Shares are received via DWAC in the applicable selling stockholder’s brokerage account prior to 11:00 a.m. Eastern Time on the respective Clearing Date. “Clearing Date” means the date on which an Equity Purchaser receives the Put Shares via DWAC in its brokerage account.
As compensation for the commitments made under the Purchase Agreement, the Company paid to the Equity Purchasers a commitment fee equal to 4% of the Maximum Commitment Amount (the “Commitment Fee”). The Commitment Fee was paid by the Company by issuing to the Equity Purchasers 28,572 shares of its Series B Preferred Stock, which shares were authorized for issuance on February 25, 2020 (“Series B Preferred Shares”).
Concurrently with the execution of the Purchase Agreement, the Company and the Equity Purchasers entered into a Registration Rights Agreement, dated as of October 24, 2019 (the “Registration Rights Agreement”). Pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement, the Company has filed a registration statement covering the resale by the Equity Purchasers of any Put Shares which may be issued pursuant to the Purchase Agreement and any and Shares which may be issued upon conversion of the Series B Preferred Shares. The effectiveness of this registration statement is a condition to the ability of the Company to issue a Put Notice to an Equity Purchaser and consummate the sale of the applicable number of Put Shares to such Equity Purchaser.
On April 15, 2021 the Company notified the Equity Purchasers of its intent to terminate the Purchase Agreement effective immediately. The Series B Preferred Shares issued to the equity purchased which represented the Commitment fee will remain outstanding and the commitment fee which was previously recorded as deferred financing costs was immediately expensed during the year ended December 31, 2020.

The “Conversion Price” shall be equal to the Variable Conversion Price (as defined below) (subject to equitable adjustments for stock splits, stock dividends or rights offerings by the Company relating to the Company’s securities or the securities of any subsidiary of the Company, combinations, recapitalization, reclassifications, extraordinary distributions and similar events).

Introduction
Prior to the Change in Control Transaction that took place on January 9, 2019, we were a lifelogging software company that developed and hosted a proprietary cloud-based software solution ‎accessible on iOS and Android devices that offers an enhanced media experience for consumers by augmenting ‎videos, livestreams and photos with additional context information and provided platform that makes it easy to ‎find and use that data when viewing or sharing media. Subsequent to the Change in Control Transaction, we changed the business plan wherein we intend to be structured as a holding company ‎with a business strategy focused on owning subsidiaries engaged in a number of diverse business activities.‎
Results of Operations
The following comparative analysis on results of operations was based primarily on the comparative audited consolidated financial statements, footnotes and related information for the periods identified below and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes to those statements that are included elsewhere in this report.
Revenue
The Company had no revenues in 2020 nor 2019. The Company currently cannot predict when the Company will become revenue producing.
Operating Expenses
Total operating expenses for 2020 increased by $1,722,609, compared to 2019, mainly as a result of an increase in general and administrative, expenses incurred in connection with the Company’s decision to broaden its business strategy.
Other Expenses
Other expenses for 2020 increased by $2,002,455 compared to 2019 as a result of the valuation of certain derivative warrants and notes, together with a material increase in the interest expense.
Net Profit (Loss)
The net loss for 2020 was ($4,124,783), a decrease of $4,347,622 compared to a net profit in 2019 of $222,839, as a result of an increase in other expenses and total operating expenses as a result of an increase in general administrative expenses.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Liquidity is the ability of an enterprise to generate adequate amounts of cash to meet its needs for cash requirements. As of December 31, 2020, our working capital deficit amounted to $3,783,009 a decrease of $778,181 as compared to $14,067 as of December 31, 2019. This decrease is primarily a result of a increase in accounts payable, partially offset by an increase in related party liabilities, notes payable and derivative liabilities and current assets.
Net cash used in operating activities was ($1,116,865) during 2020 compared to ($3,865,334) in 2019. The increase in cash used in operating activities is primarily attributable to our operating performance going from a net profit of $222,839 in fiscal 2019 to ($4,124,783) in fiscal 2020 coupled with the Company entering into certain derivative warrant and note transactions.
Net cash provided by financing activities during 2020 was $1,203,686 compared to $33,870,020 in 2019. This change was due to notes disclosed in previous sections.
Net cash used in investing activities was ($84,906) during 2020 compared to ($30,004,686) in 2019. This change was due to thirty-million used in investing activities from discontinued operations during the year ended December 31, 2019.
Capital Resources
We believe that our balance sheet cash will afford us with sufficient financing to cover immediate our projected operating expenses and working capital needs. However, in order to execute our business plan, we potentially will have to issue additional debt or equity or enter into a strategic arrangement with a third party to carry out some aspects of our business plan. There can be no assurance that additional capital will be available to us on commercially reasonable terms when needed.
Going Concern Consideration
We had an accumulated deficit of $11,030,550 as of December 31, 2020. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on our ability to raise additional capital and generate additional revenues and profits from our business plan.
In the opinion of our independent registered public accounting firm for our fiscal year end December 31, 2020, our auditor included a statement that as a result of our deficit accumulated on December 31, 2020, our net loss and net cash used in operating activities for the reporting period then ended, there is a substantial doubt as our ability to continue as a going concern without rising additional capital and generating additional revenues and profits from our business plan. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
As of December 31, 2020, we have no off-balance sheet arrangements.

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
We maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported as specified in the SEC’s rules and forms and that such information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer, performed an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2020. Based on that evaluation, our management, including our Chief Executive Officer, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of December 31, 2020 for the reasons discussed below.
Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
Management is responsible for the preparation of our financial statements and related information. Management uses its best judgment to ensure that the financial statements present fairly, in material respects, our financial position and results of operations in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.
Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in the Exchange Act. These internal controls are designed to provide reasonable assurance that the reported financial information is presented fairly, that disclosures are adequate and that the judgments inherent in the preparation of financial statements are reasonable. There are inherent limitations in the effectiveness of any system of internal controls including the possibility of human error and overriding of controls. Consequently, an ineffective internal control system can only provide reasonable, not absolute, assurance with respect to reporting financial information.
Our internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to maintaining records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect our transactions; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary for preparation of our financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that the receipts and expenditures of Company assets are made in accordance with our management and directors authorization; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding the prevention of or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements.
Under the supervision of management, including our Chief Executive Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and subsequent guidance prepared by the Commission specifically for smaller public companies. Based on that evaluation, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of December 31, 2020 because it identified the following material weakness and significant deficiencies:
● Material Weakness - The Company did not maintain effective controls over certain aspects of the financial reporting process because we (i) lacked a sufficient complement of personnel with a level of accounting expertise and an adequate supervisory review structure that is commensurate with our financial reporting requirements and (ii) did not maintain an adequate segregation of duties.
A material weakness is a deficiency or a combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the annual or interim consolidated financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. A significant deficiency is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting that is less severe than a material weakness, yet important enough to merit attention by those responsible for oversight of the Company’s financial reporting.
We expect to be materially dependent upon third parties to provide us with accounting consulting services related to derivative liability treatment and for other accounting services for the foreseeable future. We believe this will be sufficient to remediate the material weaknesses related to our accounting for derivative liability treatment discussed above. Until such time as we have a chief financial officer with the requisite expertise in U.S. GAAP, there are no assurances that the material weaknesses and significant deficiencies in our disclosure controls and procedures will not result in errors in our financial statements which could lead to a restatement of those financial statements.
Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Due to the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within our Company have been detected.
This annual report does not include an attestation report of our registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management’s report was not subject to attestation by the Company’s registered public accounting firm pursuant to SEC rules that permit us to provide only management’s report on internal control over financial reporting in this annual report.
Changes in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting
There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2020 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.","ITEM 9B. OTHER INFORMATION

In addition to his business strategy, Mr. Washington spent 10 years as ERP consultant to SMEs and Non-Profits. Mr. Washington Graduated from Hampton University with a B.S. in Finance/Accounting. .
Compliance with Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires our executive officers and directors, and persons who beneficially own more than 10% of our common stock, to file initial reports of ownership and reports of changes in ownership with the SEC. Executive officers, directors and greater than 10% beneficial shareholders are required by SEC regulations to furnish us with copies of all Section 16(a) forms they file.
Based solely upon our review of copies of such forms received by us, we believe that, during the year ended December 31, 2020, we are not aware that any officer, director or 10% or greater shareholder failed to file on a timely basis, as disclosed in the aforementioned Forms, reports required by Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act during the l year ended December 31, 2020.
Code of Ethics
The Company adopted a written code of ethics that applies to the Company’s principal executive officer, principal financial officer, principal accounting officer and controller and any persons performing similar functions.
Committees of the Board of Directors
We do not have standing audit, nominating or compensation committees, or committees performing similar functions. Our board of directors believes that it is not necessary to have standing audit, nominating or compensation committees at this time because the functions of such committees are adequately performed by our board of directors.
Board Oversight in Risk Management
Our Chief Executive Officer, who is our principal executive officer, is our sole director. In the context of risk oversight, we believe that our selection of one person to serve in both positions provides the board of directors with additional perspective which combines the operational experience of a member of management with the oversight focus of a member of the board of directors. The business and operations of our Company are managed by our board of directors as a whole, including oversight of various risks, such as operational and liquidity risks, that our Company faces. Because our board of directors includes a member of our management, this individual is responsible for both the day-to-day management of the risks we face as well as the responsibility for the oversight of risk management.","ITEM 11.

Consolidated Financial Statements for the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019:
Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019
Consolidated Statements of Operations for the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019
Consolidated Statements of Changes in Stockholders’ Deficiency for the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019
Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019
REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of
Bridgeway National Corp.
Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Bridgeway National Corp. and its subsidiaries (collectively, the “Company”) as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders’ deficiency, and cash flows for the years then ended, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
Going Concern Matter
The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements, the Company has suffered recurring losses from operations and has a net capital deficiency that raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management’s plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 2. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.
Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.
Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matters
The critical audit matters are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. We determined that there are no critical audit matters.

BRIDGEWAY NATIONAL CORP.
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2020 and 2019
Note 1 - Organization and Operations
Bridgeway National Corp., which we refer to as “the Company,” “our Company,” “we,” “us” or “our,”‎ was originally incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada as Snap Online Marketing Inc. on June 4, 2012 and subsequently changed its name to LifeLogger Technologies Corp., which we were referred to as “LifeLogger.” On April 10, 2019, we reincorporated as a Delaware corporation and changed our name to Capital Park Holdings Corp. On December 19, 2019, we changed our name to Bridgeway National Corp. Our principal business address is 1015 15th Street NW Suite 1030, Washington, DC 20005, 202-846-7869. We registered as a reporting company under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”) on April 26, 2013. We are currently listed for trading on the OTC Pink under the trading symbol “BDGY.” See Note 12 “Subsequent Events” for organizational and operational changes that occurred after December 31, 2020.
On January 9, 2019, Capital Park Opportunities Fund LP, which we refer to as “Capital Park Opportunities Fund,” acquired (i) from SBI Investments LLC, 2014-1, a statutory series of Delaware limited liability corporation (“SBI”) and Old Main Capital, LLC, a Florida series limited liability corporation (“Old Main,” together with SBI, the “Selling Shareholders”) 83,796 shares of the Company’s common stock (the “Common Stock”) owned by the Selling Shareholders and (ii) from Stewart Garner (the “Series A Preferred Stock Holder”) 1,000 shares of the Company’s Series A Preferred Stock (the “Preferred Stock”), collectively representing 84.4% of the voting power of the Company’s voting stock. Capital Park Opportunities Fund is managed by Eric Blue, our Chairman, Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and Chief Investment Officer (“CIO”).
On January 9, 2019, Eric C. Blue was elected as our sole director, CEO and CIO. On July 13, 2020, Eon Washington commenced an employment relationship with the Company as its Chief Operating Officer - Director of Operations.
On April 10, 2019, we converted from a Nevada corporation to a Delaware corporation and adopted new bylaws and a new certificate of incorporation, which amended and restated the Company’s Articles of Incorporation in Nevada. Under the new certificate of incorporation, we created an additional series of our stock now named Class B common stock, par value $0.001 per share. Each share of Class B common stock is identical to the Class A common stock in liquidation, dividend and similar rights. The only difference between our Class B common stock and our Class A common stock is that each share of Class B common stock has 10 votes for each share held, while the Class A common stock has a single vote per share, and certain actions cannot be taken without the approval of the holders of the Class B common stock.
Prior to the transactions that took place on January 9, 2019, we were a lifelogging software company that developed and hosted a proprietary cloud-based software solution ‎accessible on iOS and Android devices that offers an enhanced media experience for consumers by augmenting ‎videos, livestreams and photos with additional context information and providing a platform that makes it easy to ‎find and use that data when viewing or sharing media. Subsequent to transactions that took place on January 9, 2019, in addition to its lifelogging software business, the Company has been structured as a holding company ‎with a business strategy focused on owning subsidiaries engaged in a number of diverse business activities.‎
Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Basis of Presentation
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared by the Company in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the Unites States of America (“US GAAP”), applied on a consistent basis, and are expressed in United States dollars (“USD”).
Going Concern
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates continuity of operations, realization of assets, and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business.
As reflected in the consolidated financial statements, the Company had an accumulated deficit of $11,030,550 at December 31, 2020, and a net loss of ($4,124,783) for the year ended December 31, 2020. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
Although the Company has recently broadened its business and operating model in an effort to generate more sufficient and stable sources of revenues and cash flows, its cash position is not sufficient to support its daily operations. While the Company believes that its new business and operating model presents a viable strategy to generate sufficient revenue and believes in its ability to raise additional funds by way of a public or private offering, there can be no assurances to that effect.
The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The Company regularly evaluates estimates and assumptions. The Company bases its estimates and assumptions on current facts, historical experience and various other factors that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the accrual of costs and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. The actual results experienced by the Company may differ materially and adversely from the Company’s estimates. To the extent there are material differences between the estimates and the actual results, future results of operations will be affected.
Cash Equivalents
For the purpose of the statement of cash flows, cash equivalents include time deposits, certificate of deposits, and all highly liquid debt instruments with original maturities of three months or less.
Property and Equipment
Property and equipment are stated at cost. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to earnings as incurred; additions, renewals and betterments are capitalized. When property and equipment are retired or otherwise disposed of, the related cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the respective accounts, and any gain or loss is included in operations. Depreciation of property and equipment is provided using the declining balance method for substantially all assets with estimated lives and rates as follows:
Computer Equipment 30%
Office Equipment 20%
Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed periodically and adjusted prospectively if appropriate.
Property and equipment as at December 31, 2020 consisted of the following:

Computer and equipment 23,214 4,686

Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)
Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price paid, over the net fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, to purchase an enterprise or asset. The Company tests goodwill for impairment at least annually, during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired.
The accounting guidance provides the Company with the option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether further impairment testing is necessary. At December 31, 2019, the Company recorded an impairment for the goodwill relating to the discontinued operations. Refer to Note 9.
Intangible assets
Intellectual property, customer contracts and tradenames that were acquired by the Company from a third party are capitalized and subsequently measured at cost less accumulated amortization and accumulated impairment losses, if they have finite useful lives, they are for approved products or if there are alternative future uses. Amortization is calculated over the cost of the intangible asset less its residual value. Amortization is recognized in profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of intangible assets from the date that they are available for use, since this most closely reflects the expected pattern of consumption of the future economic benefits embodied in the asset. At December 31, 2019, the Company recorded an impairment for the intangible assets relating to the discontinued operations. Refer to Note 9.
Long-Lived Assets
The Company applies the provisions of ASC Topic 360, Property, Plant, and Equipment, which addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long-lived assets. ASC 360 requires impairment losses to be recorded on long-lived assets used in operations when indicators of impairment are present and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the assets’ carrying amounts. In that event, a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the long-lived assets. Loss on long-lived assets to be disposed of is determined in a similar manner, except that fair values are reduced for the cost of disposal. At December 31, 2019, the Company recorded an impairment for the long-lived assets relating to the discontinued operations.
Revenue Recognition
ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“Topic 606”), became effective for the Company on January 1, 2018. The Company’s revenue recognition disclosure reflects its updated accounting policies that are affected by this new standard. The Company applied the “modified retrospective” transition method for open contracts for the implementation of Topic 606. This new standard did not result in a material recognition of revenue on the Company’s accompanying consolidated financial statements for the cumulative impact of applying this new standard.
Revenue recognized under Topic 606 in a manner that reasonably reflects the delivery of its goods and services to customers in return for expected consideration and includes the following elements:
● executed contracts with the Company’s customers that it believes are legally enforceable;
● identification of performance obligations in the respective contract;
● determination of the transaction price for each performance obligation in the respective contract;
● allocation the transaction price to each performance obligation; and
● recognition of revenue only when the Company satisfies each performance obligation.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
For certain of the Company’s consolidated financial instruments, including accounts payable, the carrying amounts approximate their fair values due to their short maturities.
FASB ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, requires disclosure of the fair value of financial instruments held by the Company. FASB ASC Topic 825, Financial Instruments, defines fair value, and establishes a three-level valuation hierarchy for disclosures of fair value measurement that enhances disclosure requirements for fair value measures. The carrying amounts reported in the condensed consolidated balance sheets for receivables and current liabilities each qualify as financial instruments and are a reasonable estimate of their fair values because of the short period of time between the origination of such instruments and their expected realization and their current market rate of interest. The three levels of valuation hierarchy are defined as follows:
● Level 1 inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.
Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)
● Level 2 inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets in inactive markets, and inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument.
● Level 3 inputs to the valuation methodology use one or more unobservable inputs which are significant to the fair value measurement.
The Company analyzes all financial instruments with features of both liabilities and equity under FASB ASC Topic 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity, and FASB ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging.
The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. If the inputs used to measure the financial assets and liabilities fall within more than one level described above, the categorization is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement of the instrument. The Company’s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment, and considers factors specific to the asset or liability including certain market assumptions and pertinent information available to management.
The carrying amount of the Company’s financial assets and liabilities, such as cash, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate their fair value because of the short maturity of those instruments. The derivative liabilities are fair valued as described below.
Valuation of Derivatives
The Company evaluates its convertible instruments, options, warrants or other contracts to determine if those contracts or embedded components of those contracts qualify as derivatives to be separately accounted for under ASC Topic 815, “Derivatives and Hedging.” The result of this accounting treatment is that the fair value of the derivative is marked-to-market each balance sheet date. The change in fair value is recorded in the statement of operations as other income (expense). Upon conversion or exercise of a derivative instrument, the instrument is marked to fair value at the conversion date and then that fair value is reclassified to equity. Equity instruments that are initially classified as equity that become subject to reclassification under ASC Topic 815 are reclassified to liabilities at the fair value of the instrument on the reclassification date. The Company analyzed the derivative financial instruments in accordance with ASC 815. The objective is to provide guidance for determining whether an equity-linked financial instrument is indexed to an entity’s own stock. This determination is needed for a scope exception which would enable a derivative instrument to be accounted for under the accrual method. The classification of a non-derivative instrument that falls within the scope of ASC 815-40-05 “Accounting for Derivative Financial Instruments Indexed to, and Potentially Settled in, a Company’s Own Stock” also hinges on whether the instrument is indexed to an entity’s own stock. A non-derivative instrument that is not indexed to an entity’s own stock cannot be classified as equity and must be accounted for as a liability. There is a two-step approach in determining whether an instrument or embedded feature is indexed to an entity’s own stock. First, the instrument’s contingent exercise provisions, if any, must be evaluated, followed by an evaluation of the instrument’s settlement provisions. The Company utilized multinomial lattice models that value the derivative liability based on a probability weighted discounted cash flow model. The Company utilized the fair value standard set forth by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, defined as the amount at which the assets (or liability) could be bought (or incurred) or sold (or settled) in a current transaction between willing parties, that is, other than in a forced or liquidation sale.
The derivative liabilities result in a reduction of the initial carrying amount (as unamortized discount) of the Convertible Notes. This derivative liability is marked-to-market each quarter with the change in fair value recorded in the statement of operations. Unamortized discount is amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method over the life of the Convertible Note.
Related Parties
The Company follows subtopic 850-10 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for the identification of related parties and disclosure of related party transactions.
Income Taxes
The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes. ASC 740 requires a company to use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes, whereby deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences, and deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences. Temporary differences are the differences between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion, or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment.
Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)
Under ASC 740, a tax position is recognized as a benefit only if it is “more likely than not” that the tax position would be sustained in a tax examination, with a tax examination being presumed to occur. The amount recognized is the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized on examination. For tax positions not meeting the “more likely than not” test, no tax benefit is recorded. The Company has no material uncertain tax positions for any of the reporting periods presented.
Stock-Based Compensation
The Company records stock-based compensation in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718, Compensation - Stock Compensation. FASB ASC Topic 718 requires companies to measure compensation cost for stock-based employee compensation at fair value at the grant date and recognize the expense over the requisite service period. The Company recognizes in the statement of operations the grant-date fair value of stock options and other equity-based compensation issued to employees and non-employees.
There were no options outstanding as of December 31, 2020 (December 31, 2019 - Nil).
Basic and Diluted Earnings Per Share
Earnings per share is calculated in accordance with ASC Topic 260, Earnings Per Share. Basic earnings per share (“EPS”) is based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted EPS assumes that all dilutive securities are converted. Dilution is computed by applying the treasury stock method. Under this method, options and warrants are assumed to be exercised at the beginning of the period (or at the time of issuance, if later), and as if funds obtained thereby were used to purchase common stock at the average market price during the period. There were 2,640,625 (post reverse split number for 10,562,499) warrants and nil options outstanding as of December 31, 2020 (December 31, 2019 - nil), which could have been exercised for 2,640,625 common shares (assuming no cashless exercise), 125,001 shares of preferred convertible stock that were convertible into 120,270 common shares and $845,000 in convertible notes that were convertible into 120,270 common shares. Due to the net loss incurred potentially dilutive instruments would be anti-dilutive. Accordingly, diluted loss per share is the same as basic loss for all periods presented.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
The Company has implemented all new accounting pronouncements that are in effect. These pronouncements did not have any material impact on the consolidated financial statements unless otherwise disclosed, and the Company does not believe that there are any other new accounting pronouncements that have been issued that might have a material impact on its consolidated financial position or results of operations.
Reverse Stock Split
All references to common shares and common share data in these consolidated financial statements and elsewhere in this Form 10-K as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and for the years then ended, reflect the Reverse Stock Split approved by FINRA on February 17, 2021.

Note 3 - Convertible Notes Payable (continued)
All convertible notes issued by the Company prior to January 9, 2019 (together with all interest owed on such notes, whether default or ordinary in nature) were converted into Series B Preferred Shares (the “Equity Shares”) as of January 9, 2019.
(i) Securities Purchase Agreement and Convertible Notes Issued to Calvary Fund I, LP; Oasis Capital, LLC and SBI Investments LLC
On March 2, 2020 (the “Issue Date”), the Company entered into an unsecured promissory note purchase agreement with SBI, on behalf of itself and the other note purchasers (the “Note Purchasers”), pursuant to which the Note Purchasers purchased from the Company (a) 12% convertible promissory notes of the Company in an aggregate principal amount of $845,000 (the “12% Notes”) of which $75,000 were related to original issuance discount and $20,000 were related to deferred finance costs (with the understanding that the initial six months of such interest shall be guaranteed) (together with any note(s) issued in replacement thereof or as a dividend thereon or otherwise with respect thereto in accordance with the terms thereof, the “Notes”, and each, a “Note”), convertible into shares (the “Conversion Shares”) of common stock of the Company (the “Common Stock”) and (b) warrants (the “Warrants”) to acquire up to 1,111,842 Shares subject to a beneficial ownership cap of no greater than 4.99% in the case of each Purchaser (the “Warrant Shares”).
The maturity date of the 12% Notes shall be on that day that is nine (9) months after the Issue Date (the “Maturity Date”) and is the date upon which the principal amount of the 12% Notes, as well as all accrued and unpaid interest and other fees, shall be due and payable. The notes are currently in Default status at a rate of 24% which has been accrued.
Under the terms of the 12% Notes, the Note Purchasers shall have the right at any time on or after the Issue Date, to convert (a “Conversion”) all or any part of the outstanding and unpaid principal amount and accrued and unpaid interest of the 12% Notes, and any other amounts owed under the 12% Notes, into shares at the Conversion Price (as defined below); provided, however, that in no event shall any Note Purchaser be entitled to convert any portion of any of the 12% Notes in excess of that portion of any 12% Note upon conversion of which the sum of (a) the number of shares owned by the Note Purchaser and its affiliates (other than Shares issuable upon conversion of the 12% Notes or exercise of the Warrants held by such Note Purchaser) and (b) the number of shares issuable upon the conversion of the portion of any 12% Note with respect to which the determination of this provision is being made, would result in beneficial ownership by any Note Purchaser and its affiliates of more than 4.99% of the Company’s outstanding shares (the “Maximum Share Amount”). The “Conversion Price” per share shall be the lower of (i) $0.38 or (ii) the Variable Conversion Price (as defined below) (subject to adjustment). The “Variable Conversion Price” shall mean 70% multiplied by the Market Price (as defined below). “Market Price” means the lowest Trading Price (as defined below) for our common stock during the fifteen (15) Trading Day period ending on the last complete Trading Day prior to the Conversion Date. “Trading Price” means, as of any date, the lowest VWAP price for our shares on the applicable trading market trading market (the “Trading Market”) as reported by a reliable reporting service.
The exercise price of the Warrants is $0.38 per share, subject to adjustment. Each Warrant also contains a cashless exercise option and has a term of five (5) years from the Issue Date. The Notes and Warrants included embedded derivative features that were accounted for as derivative liabilities due to the variable conversion prices upon default and forced conversion; full reset provisions; and redemption features based on FASB. The Warrants were treated as derivative liabilities due to the tainted equity environment based on the notes that are convertible into an indeterminate number of shares. On March 2, 2020, the Company recorded an initial recognition loss of derivative liabilities of $1,739,698, $750,000 discount on the notes payable of which $50,700 is 6-months guaranteed interest and $95,000 original issuance discount amortized over the term of the convertible notes. The amount of amortization recognized on the discount for the year ended was $845,000.
As at December 31, 2020 the Company owed $845,000 (December 31, 2019 - $nil) in principal and the accrued interest was $88,349, which consisted of accrued interest and default interest.
(ii) On September 30, 2020 (the “Issue Date”), the Company entered into an unsecured promissory note purchase agreement with SBI, on behalf of itself and the other note purchasers (the “Note Purchasers”), pursuant to which the Note Purchasers purchased from the Company (a) two 6% convertible promissory notes ($155,000 each) of the Company in an aggregate principal amount of $310,000 (the “6% Notes”) convertible into Shares (the “Conversion Shares”) subject to a beneficial ownership cap of no greater than 4.99% in the case of each Purchaser. Pursuant to the agreement, each note was issued with an original issue discount of $5,000 and as such the purchase price was $150,000. The proceeds of one note was received on October 3, 2020.
The maturity date of the 6% Notes shall be on that day that is nine (9) months after the Issue Date (the “Maturity Date”) and is the date upon which the principal amount of the 6% Notes, as well as all accrued and unpaid interest and other fees, shall be due and payable. The notes also carry a default rate of 18%.
Under the terms of the 6% Notes, the Note Purchasers shall have the right at any time on or after the Issue Date, to convert (a “Conversion”) all or any part of the outstanding and unpaid principal amount and accrued and unpaid interest of the 6% Notes, and any other amounts owed under the 6% Notes, into shares at the Conversion Price of $0.16; provided, however, that in no event shall any Note Purchaser be entitled to convert any portion of any of the 6% Notes in excess of that portion of any 6% Note upon conversion of which the sum of (a) the number of owned by the Note Purchaser and its affiliates (other than Shares issuable upon conversion of the 6% Notes or exercise of the Warrants held by such Note Purchaser) and (b) the number of shares issuable upon the conversion of the portion of any 6% Note with respect to which the determination of this provision is being made, would result in beneficial ownership by any Note Purchaser and its affiliates of more than the Maximum Share Amount up to 4.99% of outstanding shares. The “Conversion Price” per share shall be $0.16.
As at December 31, 2020 the Company owed $310,000 (December 31, 2019 - $nil) in principal and the accrued interest was $4,688. The debenture is convertible into common shares of the Company at a conversion price $0.04. The convertible debt was not considered tainted due to 5,812,500 shares of common stock held on reserve for issuance upon full conversion of this debenture. The Company evaluated the convertible notes for a beneficial conversion feature in accordance with ASC 470-20 “Debt with Conversion and Other Options.” The Company determined that the conversion price was below the closing stock price on the commitment date, and the convertible notes contained a beneficial conversion feature. The Company recognized the intrinsic value of the embedded beneficial conversion feature of $258,750 as additional paid-in capital and reduced the carrying value of the convertible notes to $41,250. The carrying value will be accreted over the term of the convertible notes up to their face value of $310,000.
As at December 31, 2020, the carrying value of the 6% Note was $130,675 and had an unamortized discount of $179,325 ($172,658 beneficial conversion feature and $6,667 OID). During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recorded accretion expense of $89,425.
(iii) Securities Purchase Agreement and Convertible Notes Issued to Geneva Roth Remark Holdings, Inc.
On October 23, 2020 (the “Issue Date”), the Company entered into an unsecured promissory note purchase agreement with Geneva Roth Remark Holdings, Inc. (the “Note Purchaser”), pursuant to which the Note Purchaser purchased from the Company (a) the 9% convertible promissory note of the Company in an aggregate principal amount of $68,000 ($3,000 OID) (the “9% Note”) convertible into Shares (the “Conversion Shares”) subject to a beneficial ownership cap of no greater than 4.99% in the case of the Purchaser (the “Maximum Share Amount”).

Note 4 - Derivative Liability
In connection with the sale of debt or equity instruments, the Company may sell options or warrants to purchase the Company’s common stock. In certain circumstances, these options or warrants may be classified as derivative liabilities, rather than as equity. Additionally, the debt or equity instruments may contain embedded derivative instruments, such as embedded derivative features which in certain circumstances may be required to be bifurcated from the associated host instrument and accounted for separately as a derivative instrument liability.
The Company’s derivative instrument liabilities are re-valued at the end of each reporting period, with changes in the fair value of the derivative liability recorded as charges or credits to income in the period in which the changes occur. For options, warrants and bifurcated embedded derivative features that are accounted for as derivative instrument liabilities, the Company estimates fair value using either quoted market prices of financial instruments with similar characteristics or other valuation techniques. The valuation techniques require assumptions related to the remaining term of the instruments and risk-free rates of return, the Company’s current common stock price and expected dividend yield, and the expected volatility of the Company’s common stock price over the life of the instrument.
The following table summarizes the warrant derivative liabilities and convertible notes activity for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019:
Derivative Liabilities

Note 5 - Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The Company’s financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents, accounts payable and accrued expenses, derivative liabilities and convertible debt. The estimated fair value of cash and cash equivalents, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate their carrying amounts due to the short-term nature of these instruments.
The Company utilizes various types of financing to fund its business needs, including convertible debt with warrants attached. The Company reviews its warrants and conversion features of securities issued as to whether they are freestanding or contain an embedded derivative and, if so, whether they are classified as a liability at each reporting period until the amount is settled and reclassified into equity with changes in fair value recognized in current earnings. The fair value of the warrants and the embedded conversion feature of the convertible debt is classified as a liability. Some of these units have embedded conversion features that are treated as a discount on the Notes. Such financial instruments are initially recorded at fair value and amortized to interest expense over the life of the debt using the effective interest method.
Inputs used in the valuation to derive fair value are classified based on a fair value hierarchy which distinguishes between assumptions based on market data (observable inputs) and an entity’s own assumptions (unobservable inputs). The hierarchy consists of three levels:
Level one - Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;
Level two - Inputs other than level one inputs that are either directly or indirectly observable; and
Level three - Unobservable inputs developed using estimates and assumptions, which are developed by the reporting entity and reflect those assumptions that a market participant would use.
Determining which category an asset or liability falls within the hierarchy requires significant judgment. The Company evaluates its hierarchy disclosures each quarter. The Company’s derivative liability is measured at fair value on a recurring basis. The Company classifies the fair value of these convertible notes and warrants derivative liability under level three. The Company’s settlement payable is measured at fair value on a recurring basis based on the most recent settlement offer. The Company classifies the fair value of the settlement payable under level three. The Company’s rescission liability is measured at fair value on a recurring basis based on the most recent stock price. The Company classifies the fair value of the rescission liability under level one.
Based on ASC Topic 815 and related guidance, the Company concluded the common stock purchase warrants are required to be accounted for as derivatives as of the issue date due to a reset feature on the exercise price. At the date of issuance warrant derivative liabilities were measured at fair value using either quoted market prices of financial instruments with similar characteristics or other valuation techniques. The Company records the fair value of these derivatives on its balance sheet at fair value with changes in the values of these derivatives reflected in the statements of operations as “Gain (loss) on derivative liabilities.” These derivative instruments are not designated as hedging instruments under ASC 815-10 and are disclosed on the balance sheet under Derivative Liabilities.

Due to the cancellation of the Transaction Agreement, the loan and interest expense has been deemed as settled. Therefore, $nil balance was outstanding for the year ended December 31, 2019. In connection with the closing of the transaction contemplated by the transaction agreement, the Company received a transaction fee in the amount of $400,000 (the “Transaction Fee”) where the Company recorded the transaction fee as an accrual with its Deferred Financing Fee balance sheet account. In conjunction with termination of the Transaction Agreement, the Company has immediately reversed the accrual for the Transaction Fee and immediately expensed the Transaction Fee in this period.
Note 10 - Income Tax Provision
Deferred Tax Assets
At December 31, 2020, the Company had net operating loss (“NOL”) carryforwards for Federal income tax purposes of $4,170,283 that may be offset against future taxable income through 2036. No tax benefit has been reported with respect to these net operating loss carry-forwards in the accompanying consolidated financial statements because the Company believes that the realization of the Company’s net deferred tax assets of approximately $875,760 was not considered more likely than not and accordingly, the potential tax benefits of the net loss carry-forwards are offset by a full valuation allowance.
Deferred tax assets consist primarily of the tax effect of NOL carry-forwards. The Company has provided a full valuation allowance on the deferred tax assets because of the uncertainty regarding its realizability.
The statutory rate and the effective tax rate for and as of December 31, 2020 was 21% (2019 - 21%).

Note 11- Lease
The Company entered into an operating lease agreement with a scheduled commencement date on January 15, 2020 for a sixty-seven-month term, with an option to renew for a five-year term.
The Company adopted ASC 842 - Leases using the modified retrospective cumulative catch-up approach beginning on January 1, 2019. Under this approach, the Company did not restate its comparative amounts and recognized a right-of-use asset equal to the present value of the future lease payments. The Company elected to apply the practical expedient to only transition contracts which were previously identified as leases and elected to not recognize right-of-use assets and lease obligations for leases of low value assets.
When measuring the right of use liabilities, the Company discounted lease payments using its incremental borrowing rate at January 15, 2020. The weighted-average-rate applied is 12%.

Note 12 - Subsequent Events
Small Business Administration Loans
On March 31, 2021, Bridgeway was approved for a SBA Loan-1in the amount of $723,743 and on March 24, 2021 was approved for an SBA Loan-2 in the original principal amount of $150,000. SBA Loan-1 shall be eligible for forgiveness if during the 8-to-24-week covered period following disbursement: (i) employee and compensation levels are maintained; (ii) the loan proceeds are spent on payroll costs and other eligible expenses and (iii) at least 60% of the proceeds are spent on payroll costs. For any portion of the SBA Loan-1 that is not forgiven, it will bear interest at a 1% fixed APR for the life of the loan with payments deferred for ten (10) months. With respect to the SBA Loan-2, interest will accrue at the rate of 3.75% per annum with installment payments, including principal and interest, of $731.00 per month beginning on the twelve (12) month anniversary of the funding date. The balance of principal and interest will be payable on the thirty (30) year anniversary of the funding date.
Subsequent Financing Transaction
On January 20, 2021 (the “Issue Date”), the Company entered into an unsecured promissory note purchase agreement with Geneva Roth Remark Holdings, Inc. (the “Note Purchaser”), pursuant to which the Note Purchaser purchased from the Company (a) the 9% convertible promissory note of the Company in an aggregate principal amount of $48,000 ($3,000 OID) (the “9% Note III”) convertible into Shares (the “Conversion Shares”) subject to a beneficial ownership cap of no greater than 4.99% in the case of the Purchaser (the “Maximum share Amount”). The maturity date of the 9% Note III shall be on January 20, 2022 (the “Maturity Date”) and is the date upon which the principal amount of the 9% Note, as well as all accrued and unpaid interest and other fees, shall be due and payable. The Note also has a 22% default interest rate.
Under the terms of the 9% Note III, the Note Purchaser shall have the right at any time during the period beginning on the date which is one hundred eighty (180) days following the date of the 9% Note III and ending on the later of: (i) the Maturity Date and (ii) the date of payment of the default amount, to convert (a “Conversion”) all or any part of the outstanding and unpaid principal amount and accrued and unpaid interest of the 9% Note III, and any other amounts owed under the 9% Note III, into shares at the Conversion Price; provided, however, that in no event shall the Note Purchaser be entitled to convert any portion of any of the 9% Note III in excess of that portion of the 9% Note III upon conversion of which the sum of (a) the number of shares owned by the Note Purchaser and its affiliates and (b) the number of shares issuable upon the conversion of the portion of the 9% Note III with respect to which the determination of this provision is being made, would result in beneficial ownership by the Note Purchaser and its affiliates of more than the Maximum Share Amount. The “Conversion Price” shall be equal to the Variable Conversion Price (as defined below) (subject to equitable adjustments for stock splits, stock dividends or rights offerings by the Company relating to the Company’s securities or the securities of any subsidiary of the Company, combinations, recapitalization, reclassifications, extraordinary distributions and similar events). The “Variable Conversion Price” shall mean 65% multiplied by the Market Price (representing a discount rate of 35%). “Market Price” means the average of the three (3) lowest trading prices for the shares during the fifteen (15) trading day period ending on the latest complete trading day prior to the Conversion Date.
Class A and Class B Common Stock Reverse Stock Split
On October 16, 2020, the board of directors (the “Board”) of the Company and a stockholder holding a majority of the voting power of the Company’s voting stock (the “Majority Stockholder”) took action by joint written consent in lieu of a meeting to: (i) ratify the approval of an amendment to the Company’s certificate of incorporation, which amendment was filed with the Delaware Secretary of State on December 19, 2019 and was declared effective on January 20, 2020 (the “December 2019 Amendment”), which (i) changed the Company’s name from “Capital Park Holdings Corp.” to “Bridgeway National Corp.” and (ii) increased our authorized capital stock from 30,000,000 shares to 250,000,000 shares, of which 168,750,000 shares were designated as Class A Common Stock (the “Class A Common Stock”), 18,750,000 shares were designated as Class B Common Stock (the “Class B Common Stock”) and 62,500,000 shares were designated as preferred stock, of which 62,374,819 shares were previously designated as Series A Preferred Stock (the “Series A Preferred Stock”) and 125,181 shares were previously designated as Series B Preferred Stock (the “Series B Preferred Stock”); (ii) approve a further amendment to the Company’s certificate of incorporation (the “Recapitalization Amendment”) to increase the Common Stock from 187,500,000 shares to 400,000,000 shares, of which 360,000,000 shares will be designated as the Class A Common Stock and 40,000,000 shares will be designated as the Class B Common Stock and (iii) approve an additional amendment to the certificate of incorporation to effect a reverse stock split of our outstanding shares of our Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock at the at the ratio of one-for-4 (the “Reverse Stock Split Amendment,” and together with the December 2019 Amendment and the Recapitalization Amendment, collectively, the “Amendments”).
The December 2019 Amendment will not be deemed ratified, and the Recapitalization Amendment and Reverse Stock Split Amendment will not be made effective until at least twenty (20) calendar days after the mailing of the Information Statement accompanying this Notice. In addition, the Reverse Stock Split Amendment will not be made effective until the Recapitalization Amendment is made effective and we receive FINRA approval for the Reverse Stock Split from the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”). We received written notification that FINRA had approved the Reverse Stock Split on February 17, 2021.",6

RISK FACTORS
An investment in our Common Stock is subject to many risks. You should carefully consider the risks described below, together with all of the other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K (this “Annual Report”), including the financial statements and the related notes, before you decide whether to invest in our Common Stock. Our business, operating results and financial condition could be harmed by any of the following risks. The trading price of our Common Stock could decline due to any of these risks, and you could lose all or part of your investment.
Risks Related to the Company
We have incurred losses in the past and there can be no assurance that we will operate profitably in the future.
Our marketing strategy emphasizes sales of subscription-based services, instead of annual licenses, and using Spokes to connect to our Hubs. This strategy has resulted in the development of a foundation of retail and wholesale Hubs to which suppliers can be “connected”, thereby accelerating future growth. If, however, this marketing strategy fails, revenue and operations will be negatively affected. We had net income of $4,117,395 for the year ended June 30, 2021, compared to a net income of $1,593,269 for the year ended June 30, 2020. Although we generated net income in the year ended June 30, 2021, there can be no assurance that we will achieve profitability in future periods. We cannot provide assurance that we will continue to generate revenue or have sustainable profits. If we do not operate profitably in the future, our current cash resources will be used to fund our operating losses. Continued losses would have an adverse effect on the long-term value of our Common Stock and any investment in the Company.
Although our cash resources are currently sufficient, our long-term liquidity and capital requirements may be difficult to predict, which may adversely affect our long-term cash position.
Historically, we have been successful in raising capital when necessary, including through private placements, a registered direct offering, and stock issuances to our officers and directors, including our Chief Executive Officer, to pay our indebtedness and fund our operations, in addition to cash flow from operations. If we are required to seek additional financing in the future in order to fund our operations, retire our indebtedness and otherwise carry out our business plan, there can be no assurance that such financing will be available on acceptable terms, or at all, and there can be no assurance that any such arrangement, if required or otherwise sought, would be available on terms deemed to be commercially acceptable and in our best interests.
Our business is dependent upon the continued services of our founder and Chief Executive Officer, Randall K. Fields. Should we lose the services of Mr. Fields, our operations will be negatively impacted.
Our business is dependent upon the expertise and continued service of our founder and Chief Executive Officer, Randall K. Fields. Mr. Fields is essential to our operations. Accordingly, an investor must rely on Mr. Fields’ management decisions that will continue to control our business affairs. We currently maintain key man insurance on Mr. Fields’ life in the amount of $5,000,000; however, that coverage would be inadequate to compensate for the loss of his services. The loss of the services of Mr. Fields would have a materially adverse effect upon our business.
Risk Relating to Business Operations
Quarterly and annual operating results may fluctuate, which makes it difficult to predict future performance.
Management expects a significant portion of our revenue stream to come from the sale of subscriptions, and to a lesser extent, transactions processed though MarketPlace, license sales, maintenance and professional services charged to new customers. These amounts will fluctuate and are uncertain because predicting future sales is difficult and involves speculation. In addition, we may potentially experience significant fluctuations in future operating results caused by a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control, including:
●
our ability to retain and increase sales to existing customers, attract new customers and satisfy our customers’ requirements;
●
the renewal rates for our subscriptions and other services;
●
changes in our pricing policies, whether initiated by us or as a result of competition;
●
the cost, timing and management effort for the introduction of new services, including new features to our existing services;
●
the rate of expansion and productivity of our sales force;
●
new product and service introductions by our competitors;
●
variations in the revenue mix of editions or versions of our service;
●
technical difficulties or interruptions in our service;
●
general economic conditions that may adversely affect either our customers’ ability or willingness to purchase additional subscriptions or upgrade their services, or delay a prospective customer’s purchasing decision, or reduce the value of new subscription contracts or affect renewal rates;
●
timing of additional expenses and investments in infrastructure to support growth in our business;
●
regulatory compliance costs;
●
consolidation in the food industry;
●
the timing of customer payments and payment defaults by customers;
●
extraordinary expenses such as litigation or other dispute-related settlement payments;
●
the impact of new accounting pronouncements;
●
the timing of stock awards to employees and the related financial statement impact; and
●
system or service failures, security breaches or network downtime.
Future operating results may fluctuate because of the foregoing factors, making it difficult to predict operating results. Period-to-period comparisons of operating results are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indicator of future performance. In addition, a large portion of our expense will be fixed in the short-term, particularly with respect to facilities and personnel making future operating results sensitive to fluctuations in revenue.
We face threats from competing and emerging technologies that may affect our profitability, as well as competitors that are larger and have greater financial and operational resources that may give them an advantage in the market.
Markets for our type of software products and that of our competitors are characterized by development of new software, software solutions or enhancements that are subject to constant change; rapidly evolving technological change; and unanticipated changes in customer needs. Because these markets are subject to such rapid change, the life cycle of our products is difficult to predict. As a result, we are subject to the following risks: whether or how we will respond to technological changes in a timely or cost-effective manner; whether the products or technologies developed by our competitors will render our products and services obsolete or shorten the life cycle of our products and services; and whether our products and services will achieve market acceptance.
Moreover, many of our competitors are larger and have greater financial and operational resources than we do. This may allow them to offer better pricing terms to customers in the industry, which could result in a loss of potential or current customers or could force us to lower prices. Our competitors may have the ability to devote more financial and operational resources to the development of new technologies that provide improved operating functionality and features to their product and service offerings. If successful, their development efforts could render our product and service offerings less desirable to customers, again resulting in the loss of customers or a reduction in the price we can demand for our offerings. Any of these actions could have a significant effect on revenue.
We face risks associated with new product introductions.
Our future revenue is dependent upon the successful and timely development of new and enhanced versions of our products and potential product offerings suitable to the customers’ needs. If we fail to successfully upgrade existing products and develop new products, and those new products do not achieve market acceptance, our revenue will be negatively impacted.
It may be difficult for us to assess risks associated with potential new product offerings:
●
it may be difficult for us to predict the amount of service and technological resources that will be needed by customers of new offerings, and if we underestimate the necessary resources, the quality of our service will be negatively impacted, thereby undermining the value of the product to the customer;
●
technological issues between us and our customers may be experienced in capturing data necessary for new product offerings, and these technological issues may result in unforeseen conflicts or technological setbacks when implementing these products, which could result in material delays and even result in a termination of the engagement;
●
a customer’s experience with new offerings, if negative, may prevent us from having an opportunity to sell additional products and services to that customer;
●
if customers do not use our products as recommends and/or fail to implement any needed corrective action(s), it is unlikely that customers will experience the business benefits from these products and may, therefore, be hesitant to continue the engagement as well as acquire any other products from us; and
●
delays in proceeding with the implementation of new products for a new customer will negatively affect our cash flow and our ability to predict cash flow.
We cannot accurately predict renewal or upgrade rates and the impact these rates may have on our future revenue and operating results.
Our customers have no obligation to renew their subscriptions for our service after the expiration of their initial subscription period. Our renewal rates may decline or fluctuate as a result of factors, including customer dissatisfaction with our service, customers’ ability to continue their operations and spending levels, consolidation, and deteriorating general economic conditions. If our customers do not renew their subscriptions for our service or reduce the level of service at the time of renewal, our revenue will decline, and our business will suffer.
Our future success also depends in part on our ability to increase rates, sell additional features and services, or addition subscriptions to our current customers. This may also require increasingly sophisticated and costly sales and marketing efforts that are targeted at senior management. If these strategies fail, we will need to refocus our efforts toward other solutions, which could lead to increased development and marketing costs, delayed revenue streams, and otherwise negatively affect our operations.
If our Compliance and Food Safety solutions do not perform as expected, whether as a result of operator error or otherwise, it could impair our operating results and reputation.
Our success depends on the food safety market’s confidence that we can provide reliable, high-quality reporting for our customers. We believe that our customers are likely to be particularly sensitive to product defects and operator errors, including if our systems fail to accurately report issues that could reduce the liability of our clients in the event of a product recall. In addition, our reputation and the reputation of our products can be adversely affected if our systems fail to perform as expected. However, if our customers or potential customers fail to implement and use our systems as suggested by us, they may not be able to deal with a recall as effectively as they could have. As a result, the failure or perceived failure of our products to perform as expected, could have a material adverse effect on our revenue, results of operations and business.
If a customer is sued because of a recalled product we could be joined in that suit, the defense of which would impair our operating results.
We believe our Compliance and Food Safety solutions would be helpful in the event of a recall. However, their ultimate usefulness is dependent on how the customer uses our products, which is in many ways out of our control. Similarly, a customer which is a defendant in a product liability case could claim that had our services performed as represented the extent of potential liability would have been minimized and therefore, we should have some contributory liability in the case. Defending such a claim could have a material adverse effect on our revenue, results of operations and business.
The deployment of our services, or consultation provided by our personnel, could result in litigation naming us as a party, which litigation could result in a material and adverse effect on us, and our results of operations.
Our Compliance and Food Safety solutions are marketed to potential customers based, in part, on our service’s ability to reduce a company’s potential regulatory, legal, and criminal risk from its supply chain partners. In the event litigation is commenced against a customer based on issues caused by a constituent in the supply chain, or consultation provided by our personnel, we could be joined or named in such litigation. As a result, we could face substantial defense costs. In addition, any adverse determination resulting in such litigation could have a material and adverse effect on us, and our results of operations.
We face risks relating to the sale and delivery of merchandise to customers.
We depend on a number of other companies to perform functions critical to our ability to deliver products to our customers, including maintaining inventory, preparing merchandise for shipment to our customers and delivering purchased merchandise on a timely basis. We also depend on the delivery services that we and they utilize. We also depend on our partners to ensure proper labelling of products. Issues or concerns regarding, product safety, labelling, content or quality could result in consumer or governmental claims. In limited circumstances, we sell merchandise that we have purchased. In these instances, we assume the risks related to inventory.
We face risks associated with proprietary protection of our software.
Our success depends on our ability to develop and protect existing and new proprietary technology and intellectual property rights. We seek to protect our software, documentation and other written materials primarily through a combination of patents, trademarks, and copyright laws, trade secret laws, confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions. While we have attempted to safeguard and maintain our proprietary rights, there are no assurances that we will be successful in doing so. Our competitors may independently develop or patent technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to ours.
Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary. In some types of situations, we may rely in part on ‘shrink wrap’ or ‘point and click’ licenses that are not signed by the end user and, therefore, may be unenforceable under the laws of certain jurisdictions. Policing unauthorized use of our products is difficult. While we are unable to determine the extent to which piracy our software exists, software piracy can be expected to be a persistent problem, particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect proprietary rights as fully as the United States. We can offer no assurance that our means of protecting our proprietary rights will be adequate or that our competitors will not reverse engineer or independently develop similar technology.
We may discover software errors in our products that may result in a loss of revenue, injury to our reputation or subject us to substantial liability.
Non-conformities or bugs (“errors”) may be found from time to time in our existing, new or enhanced products after commencement of commercial shipments, resulting in loss of revenue or injury to our reputation. In the past, we have discovered errors in our products and as a result, have experienced delays in the shipment of products. Errors in our products may be caused by defects in third-party software incorporated into our products. If so, we may not be able to fix these defects without the cooperation of these software providers. Because these defects may not be as significant to the software provider as they are to us, we may not receive the rapid cooperation that may be required. We may not have the contractual right to access the source code of third-party software, and even if we do have access to the code, we may not be able to fix the defect. In addition, our customers may use our service in unanticipated ways that may cause a disruption in service for other customers attempting to access their data. Since our customers use our products for critical business applications, any errors, defects or other performance problems could hurt our reputation and may result in damage to our customers’ business. If that occurs, customers could elect not to renew, delay or withhold payment to us, we could lose future sales or customers may make warranty or other claims against us, which could result in an increase in our provision for doubtful accounts, an increase in collection cycles for accounts receivable or the expense and risk of litigation. These potential scenarios, successful or otherwise, would likely be time consuming and costly.
Interruptions or delays in service from our third-party data center hosting facility could impair the delivery of our service and harm our business.
We currently serve our customers from a third-party data center hosting facility located in the United States. Any damage to, or failure of, our systems generally could result in interruptions in our service. As we continue to add capacity, we may move or transfer our data and our customers’ data. Despite precautions taken during this process, any unsuccessful data transfers may impair the delivery of our service. Further, any damage to, or failure of, our systems generally could result in interruptions in our service. Interruptions in our service may reduce our revenue, cause us to issue credits or pay penalties, cause customers to terminate their subscriptions and adversely affect our renewal rates and our ability to attract new customers. Our business will also be harmed if our customers and potential customers believe our service is unreliable.
As part of our current disaster recovery arrangements, our production environment and all of our customers’ data is currently replicated in near real-time in a separate facility physically located in a different region of the United States. We do not control the operation of these facilities, and they are vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes, floods, fires, power loss, telecommunications failures and similar events. They may also be subject to break-ins, sabotage, intentional acts of vandalism and similar misconduct. Despite precautions taken at these facilities, the occurrence of a natural disaster or an act of terrorism, a decision to close the facilities without adequate notice or other unanticipated problems at these facilities could result in lengthy interruptions in our service. Even with the disaster recovery arrangements, our service could be interrupted.
If our security measures are breached and unauthorized access is obtained to a customer’s data, our data or our information technology systems, our service may be perceived as not being secure, customers may curtail or stop using our service and we may incur significant legal and financial exposure and liabilities.
Our service involves the storage and transmission of customers’ proprietary information, and security breaches could expose us to a risk of loss of this information, litigation and possible liability. These security measures may be breached as a result of third-party action, including intentional misconduct by computer hackers, employee error, malfeasance or otherwise during transfer of data to additional data centers or at any time, and result in someone obtaining unauthorized access to our customers’ data or our data, including our intellectual property and other confidential business information, or our information technology systems. Additionally, third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or customers into disclosing sensitive information, such as user names, passwords or other information in order to gain access to our customers’ data or our data, including our intellectual property and other confidential business information, or our information technology systems. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, or to sabotage systems, change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. Any security breach could result in a loss of confidence in the security of our service, damage our reputation, disrupt our business, lead to legal liability and negatively impact our future sales.
Security breaches and other disruptions could compromise our information and expose us to liability, which would cause our business and reputation to suffer.
In the ordinary course of our business, we collect and store sensitive data, including intellectual property, our proprietary business information and that of our customers, suppliers and business partners, and personally identifiable information of our customers and employees, in our data centers and on our networks. The secure processing, maintenance and transmission of this information is critical to our operations and business strategy. Despite our security measures, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions. Any such breach could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. Any such access, disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, and regulatory penalties, disrupt our operations and the services we provide to customers, and damage our reputation, and cause a loss of confidence in our products and services, which could adversely affect our business/operating margins, revenues and competitive position.
The secure processing, maintenance and transmission of this information is critical to our operations and business strategy, and we devote significant resources to protecting our information. The expenses associated with protecting our information could reduce our operating margins.
Weakened global economic conditions may adversely affect our industry, business and results of operations.
The rate at which our customers purchase new or enhanced services depends on several factors, including general economic conditions. The United States and other key international economies have experienced in the past a downturn in which economic activity was impacted by falling demand for a variety of goods and services, restricted credit, poor liquidity, reduced corporate profitability, volatility in credit, equity and foreign exchange markets, bankruptcies and overall uncertainty with respect to the economy. These conditions affect the rate of information technology spending and could adversely affect our customers’ ability or willingness to purchase our enterprise cloud computing services, delay prospective customers’ purchasing decisions, reduce the value or duration of their subscription contracts or affect renewal rates, all of which could adversely affect our operating results.
COVID-19 could potentially affect our sales and disrupt our operations and could have a material adverse impact on the Company.
The global COVID-19 pandemic could adversely impact our operations or those of our customers. The extent to which COVID-19 impacts our operations and those of our customers will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence. If the public continues to avoid public spaces, including retail stores, or if we, or any of our customers encounter any disruptions to our or their respective operations, facilities or stores, or if our customers were to partially or fully shut down due to COVID-19, then we or they may be prevented or delayed from effectively operating our or their business, respectively, and the marketing and sale of our services and our financial results could be adversely affected.
Risks Relating to Our Common Stock
Our quarterly results of operations may fluctuate in the future, which could result in volatility in our stock price.
Our quarterly revenue and results of operations have varied in the past and may fluctuate as a result of a variety of factors. If our quarterly revenue or results of operations fluctuate, the price of our Common Stock could decline substantially. Fluctuations in our results of operations may be due to several factors, including, but not limited to, those listed and identified throughout this “Risk Factors” section.
The limited public market for our stock may adversely affect an investor’s ability to liquidate an investment in us.
Although our Common Stock is currently quoted on the NASDAQ Capital Market, there is limited trading activity. We can give no assurance that an active market will develop, or if developed, that it will be sustained. If an investor acquires shares of our Common Stock, the investor may not be able to liquidate our shares should there be a need or desire to do so.
Future issuances of our shares may lead to future dilution in the value of our Common Stock, will lead to a reduction in shareholder voting power and may prevent a change in control.
The shares may be substantially diluted due to the following:

issuance of Common Stock in connection with funding agreements with third parties and future issuances of Common Stock and the Company’s Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 (“Preferred Stock ”) by the Board of Directors; and
●
the Board of Directors has the power to issue additional shares of Common Stock and Preferred Stock and the right to determine the voting, dividend, conversion, liquidation, preferences and other conditions of the shares without shareholder approval.
Stock issuances may result in reduction of the book value or market price of outstanding shares of Common Stock. If we issue any additional shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock, proportionate ownership of Common Stock and voting power will be reduced. Further, any new issuance of Common Stock or Preferred Stock may prevent a change in control or management.
Our officers and directors have significant control over us, which may lead to conflicts with other stockholders over corporate governance.
Our officers and directors control approximately 41% of our Common Stock. Randall K. Fields, our Chief Executive Officer, controls 34% of our Common Stock. Consequently, Mr. Fields, individually, and our officers and directors, as stockholders acting together, can significantly influence all matters requiring approval by our stockholders, including the election of directors and significant corporate transactions, such as mergers or other business combination transactions.
Our corporate charter contains authorized, unissued “blank check” Preferred Stock issuable without stockholder approval with the effect of diluting then current stockholder interests.
Our articles of incorporation currently authorize the issuance of up to 30,000,000 shares of ‘blank check’ Preferred Stock with designations, rights, and preferences as may be determined from time to time by our Board of Directors, of which 700,000 shares are currently designated as Series B Convertible Preferred Stock (“Series B Preferred”) and 550,000 shares are designated as Series B-1 Preferred Stock (“Series B-1 Preferred”). As of June 30, 2021, a total of 625,375 shares of Series B Preferred and 212,402 shares of Series B-1 Preferred were issued and outstanding.
Our Board of Directors is empowered, without stockholder approval, to issue one or more additional series of Preferred Stock with dividend, liquidation, conversion, voting, or other rights that could dilute the interest of, or impair the voting power of, our Common Stockholders. The issuance of an additional series of Preferred Stock could be used as a method of discouraging, delaying or preventing a change in control.
We have not paid dividends on our Common Stock, and investors should consider the potential for us to pay dividends on our Common Stock as a factor when determining whether to invest in us.
We have not paid dividends on our Common Stock and do not anticipate the declaration of any dividends pertaining to our Common Stock in the foreseeable future. We intend to retain earnings, if any, to finance the development and expansion of our business. Our Board of Directors will determine our future dividend policy at their sole discretion, and future dividends will be contingent upon future earnings, if any, obligations of the stock issued, our financial condition, capital requirements, general business conditions and other factors. Future dividends may also be affected by covenants contained in loan or other financing documents, which we may executed in the future. Therefore, there can be no assurance that dividends will ever be paid on our Common Stock.
Our officers and directors have limited liability and indemnification rights under our organizational documents, which may impact our results.
Our officers and directors are required to exercise good faith and high integrity in the management of our affairs. Our articles of incorporation and bylaws, however, provide that the officers and directors shall have no liability to the stockholders for losses sustained or liabilities incurred which arise from any transaction in their respective managerial capacities unless they violated their duty of loyalty, did not act in good faith, engaged in intentional misconduct or knowingly violated the law, approved an improper dividend or stock repurchase or derived an improper benefit from the transaction. As a result, an investor may have a more limited right to action than he would have had if such a provision were not present. Our articles of incorporation and bylaws also require us to indemnify our officers and directors against any losses or liabilities they may incur as a result of the manner in which they operate our business or conduct our internal affairs, provided that the officers and directors reasonably believe such actions to be in, or not opposed to, our best interests, and their conduct does not constitute gross negligence, misconduct or breach of fiduciary obligations.",,"ITEM 2.

Share Repurchase Program
On May 9, 2019, our Board of Directors approved of the repurchase of up to $4.0 million shares of our Common Stock, which repurchases may be made in privately negotiated transactions or in the open market at prices per share not exceeding the then-current market prices (the “Share Repurchase Program”). Under the Share Repurchase Program, management has discretion to determine the dollar amount of shares to be repurchased and the timing of any repurchases in compliance with applicable laws and regulations, including Rule 12b-18 of the Exchange Act. On March 17, 2020, given the extreme uncertainty due to COVID-19 at the time, the Board suspended the Share Repurchase Program.
On May 18, 2021, our Board of Directors resumed its Share Repurchase Program, and increased the buyback from $4 million to $6 million. The Share Repurchase Program expires 24 months following May 18, 2021, and it may be suspended for periods of time or discontinued at any time, at the Board’s discretion. The total remaining authorization for future shares of Common Stock repurchases under our Share Repurchase Program was $2,050,885 as of June 30, 2021. From time-to-time, our Board may authorize further increases to our Share Repurchase Program.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The following Management’s Discussion and Analysis is intended to assist the reader in understanding our results of operations and financial condition. Management’s Discussion and Analysis is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our audited consolidated financial statements beginning on page of this Annual Report on Form 10-K (this ""Annual Report""). This Annual Report includes certain statements that may be deemed to be “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act. All statements, other than statements of historical fact, included in this Annual Report that address activities, events or developments that we expect, project, believe, or anticipate will or may occur in the future, including matters having to do with expected and future revenue, our ability to fund our operations and repay debt, business strategies, expansion and growth of operations and other such matters, are forward-looking statements. These statements are based on certain assumptions and analyses made by our management in light of its experience and its perception of historical trends, current conditions, expected future developments, and other factors it believes are appropriate in the circumstances. These statements are subject to a number of assumptions, risks and uncertainties, including general economic and business conditions, the business opportunities (or lack thereof) that may be presented to and pursued by us, our performance on our current contracts and our success in obtaining new contracts, our ability to attract and retain qualified employees, and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. You are cautioned that these forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and those actual results or developments may differ materially from those projected in such statements.
Overview
The Company is a SaaS provider, and the parent company of ReposiTrak, a B2B e-commerce, compliance, and supply chain management platform company that partners with retailers, wholesalers, and product suppliers to help them source, vet, and transact with their suppliers in order to accelerate sales, control risks, and improve supply chain efficiencies. The Company’s fiscal year ends on June 30. References to fiscal 2021 refer to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021.
Sources of Revenue
The principal customers for the Company’s products are multi-store retail chains, wholesalers and distributors, and their suppliers. The Company has a Hub and Spoke business model, whereby the Company is typically engaged by Hubs, which in turn require Spokes to utilize the Company’s services. The Company derives revenue from five sources: (i) subscription fees, (ii) transaction based fees, (iii) professional services fees, (iv) license fees, and (v) hosting and maintenance fees
A significant portion of the Company’s revenue is generated from its Supply Chain solutions and Compliance and Food Safety solutions in the form of recurring subscription payments from the suppliers. Subscription fees can be based on a negotiated flat fee per supplier, or some volumetric metric, such as the number of stores, or the volume of economic activity between a retailer and its suppliers. Subscription revenue contains arrangements with customers for use of the application, application and data hosting, maintenance of the application, and standard support.
Revenue from the Company’s MarketPlace sourcing solution is transactional, based on the volume of products sourced via the application. MarketPlace revenue can come from several sources depending on the customer’s specific requirements. These include acting as an agent for a supplier, providing supply chain technology services, and enabling a Hub to reduce its number of new suppliers by acting as the supplier for any number of products.
The Company also provides professional consulting services targeting implementation, assessments, profit optimization and support functions for its applications and related products, for which revenue is recognized on a percentage-of-completion or pro rata basis over the life of the subscription, depending on the nature of the engagement. Premier customer support includes extended availability and additional services and is available along with additional support services such as developer support and partner support for an addition fee.
In some instances, the Company will sell its software in the form of a license. License arrangements are a time-specific and perpetual license. Software license maintenance agreements are typically annual contracts, paid in advance or according to terms specified in the contract. When sold as a license, the Company’s software, is usually accompanied by a corresponding Maintenance and/or Hosting Agreement to support the service.
Software maintenance agreements provide the customer with access to new software enhancements, maintenance releases, patches, updates and technical support personnel. Our hosting services provide remote management and maintenance of our software and customers’ data, which is physically located in third-party facilities. Customers access ‘hosted’ software and data through a secure internet connection.
Revenue Recognition
Effective July 1, 2018, we adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Board’s Accounting Standards Update 2014-09: Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), and its related amendments (“ASU 2014-09”). ASU 2014-09 provides a unified model to determine when and how revenue is recognized and enhances certain disclosure around the nature, timing, amount and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customers.
ASU 2014-09 represents a change in the accounting model utilized for the recognition of revenue and certain expense arising from contracts with customers. We adopted ASU 2014-09 using a “modified retrospective” approach and, accordingly, revenue and expense totals for all periods before July 1, 2018 reflect those previously reported under the prior accounting model and have not been restated.
Other Metrics - Non-GAAP Financial Measures
To supplement our financial statements, historically we have provided investors with Adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP income per share, both of which are non-GAAP financial measures. We believe that these non-GAAP measures may provide useful information regarding certain financial and business trends relating to our financial condition and operations. Our management uses these non-GAAP measures to compare the Company’s performance to that of prior periods for trend analyses and planning purposes. These measures are also presented to our Board of Directors.
These non-GAAP measures should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (“GAAP”). These non-GAAP financial measures exclude significant expenses and income that are required by GAAP to be recorded in the Company’s financial statements and are subject to inherent limitations. Investors should review the reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to the comparable GAAP financial measures that are included in this “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”
Critical Accounting Policies
This Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations discusses the Company’s financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of our financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenue and expense during the reporting period.
On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates and assumptions based on historical experience of operations and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
Income Taxes
In determining the carrying value of the Company’s net deferred income tax assets, the Company must assess the likelihood of sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions, based on estimates and assumptions, to realize the benefit of these assets. If these estimates and assumptions change in the future, the Company may record a reduction in the valuation allowance, resulting in an income tax benefit in the Company’s statements of operations. Management evaluates quarterly whether to realize the deferred income tax assets and assesses the valuation allowance.
Goodwill and Other Long-Lived Asset Valuations
Goodwill is assigned to specific reporting units and is reviewed for possible impairment at least annually or upon the occurrence of an event or when circumstances indicate that a reporting unit’s carrying amount is greater than its fair value. Management reviews the long-lived tangible and intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. Management evaluates, at each balance sheet date, whether events and circumstances have occurred which indicate possible impairment.
The carrying value of a long-lived asset is considered impaired when the anticipated cumulative undiscounted cash flows of the related asset or group of assets is less than the carrying value. In that event, a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair market value of the long-lived asset. Economic useful lives of long-lived assets are assessed and adjusted as circumstances dictate.
Stock-Based Compensation
The Company recognizes the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments based on the grant-date fair value of those awards. The Company records compensation expense on a straight-line basis. The fair value of any options granted are estimated at the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option pricing model with assumptions for the risk-free interest rate, expected life, volatility, dividend yield and forfeiture rate.
Capitalization of Software Development Costs
The Company accounts for research costs of computer software to be sold, leased or otherwise marketed as expense until technological feasibility has been established for the product. Once technological feasibility is established, all software costs are capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers. Judgment is required in determining when technological feasibility of a product is established.
We have determined that technological feasibility for our software products is reached shortly after a working prototype is complete and meets or exceeds design specifications including functions, features, and technical performance requirements. Costs incurred after technological feasibility is established have been and will continue to be capitalized until such time as when the product or enhancement is available for general release to customers. The Company capitalized software development costs of $171,733 in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
The Company does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, revenue and results of operation, liquidity or capital expenditures.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-15 Intangibles - Goodwill and Other Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40) - Customer’s Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement That is a Service Contract. The amendments in this update apply to an entity who is a customer in a hosting arrangement accounted for as a service contract. The update requires a customer in a hosting arrangement to capitalize certain implementation costs. Costs associated with the application development stage of the implementation should be capitalized and costs with the other stages should be expensed. For instance, costs for training and data conversion should be expensed. The capitalized implementation costs should be expensed over the term of the hosting arrangement, which is the noncancelable period plus periods covered by an option to extend if the customer is reasonably certain to exercise the option. Impairment of the capitalized costs should be considered similar to other intangibles. The effective date of this update is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019 for public entities and after December 15, 2020 for all other entities with early adoption permitted. The Company is a customer in a hosting arrangement and may enter into new arrangements in the future. The Company adopted the standard during the second quarter of fiscal year 2020. This standard did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-13 Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820) Disclosure Framework - Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement. This ASU eliminates, amends, and adds disclosure requirements for fair value measurements. The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company adopted the standard during the second quarter of fiscal year 2020. This standard did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
In June 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-07 Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718), Improvements to Nonemployee Share-Based Payment Accounting. The amendments in this update expand the scope of Topic 718 to include share-based payment transactions for acquiring goods and services from nonemployees. Prior to this update, equity-based payments to non-employees was accounted for under Subtopic 505-50 resulting in significant differences between the accounting for share-based payments to non-employees as compared to employees. One of the most significant changes is that non-employee share-based awards (classified as equity awards) may be measured at grant-date fair value and not have to be continually revalued until the service/goods are rendered. The update also indicates that share-based awards related to financing and awards granted to a customer in conjunction with selling goods or services are not included in Topic 718. This standard is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018 for public entities and December 15, 2019 for all other entities. Early adoption is permitted, but no earlier than an entity’s adoption date of Topic 606. The Company adopted the standard during the first quarter of fiscal year 2020. This standard did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04 Intangibles-Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment, which amends and simplifies the accounting standard for goodwill impairment. The new standard removes Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test, which requires a hypothetical purchase price allocation. A goodwill impairment will now be the amount a reporting unit’s carrying value exceeds its fair value, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. The new standard is effective for annual and any interim impairment tests for periods beginning after December 15, 2019. The Company adopted the standard during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020. This standard did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02 Leases (Topic 842). Under the new guidance, lessees will be required to recognize for all leases (with the exception of short-term leases) a lease liability, which is a lessee’s obligation to make lease payments arising from a lease, measured on a discounted basis and a right-of-use asset, which is an asset that represents the lessee’s right to use, or control the use of, a specified asset for the lease term.
Effective July 1, 2019, the Company adopted the requirements of Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) (""ASU 2016-02""). All amounts and disclosures set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K have been updated to comply with this new standard with results for reporting periods beginning after July 1, 2019 presented under ASU 2016-02, while prior period amounts and disclosures are not adjusted and continue to be reported under the accounting standards in effect for the prior period.

During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021, the Company had revenue of $21,007,076 compared to $20,038,054 for the year ended June 30, 2020, a 5% increase. The increase in revenue was due to growth in both subscription revenue and Marketplace revenue, partially offset by approximately $145,500 in one-time license revenue that occurred in 2020 that did not reoccur in 2021.
During fiscal 2021, as COVID-19 disrupted supply chains and generated shortages in products, our ability to source hard to find items for our customers resulted in increased revenue attributable to MarketPlace. These products largely consisted of personel protective equipment (""PPE"") which includes nitrile gloves, masks, freezers and telecommunication equipment. While the Company has experienced a significant increase in Marketplace revenue for PPE during the height of COVID-19, it is uncertain whether demand for PPE will continue at the same level. As a result, we may experience reduced demand for MarketPlace attributable to PPE as the pandemic begins to abate.

This decrease is primarily the result of (i) higher expense associated to MarketPlace and the sales of PPE; and (ii) an increase in hardware/software non-capitalized items required for updating our information systems security, maintaining equipment licensing and other database systems.
While we have experienced a significant increase in Marketplace costs and corresponding revenue during the pandemic due to demand in PPE, it is unclear what level of ongoing Marketplace costs we may experience as the pandemic begins to abate.

Financial Position, Liquidity and Capital Resources
We believe that our existing cash and short-term investments, together with funds generated from operations, are sufficient to fund operating and investment requirements for at least the next twelve months. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including macroeconomic conditions, our rate of revenue growth, sales and marketing activities, the timing and extent of spending required for research and development efforts and the continuing market acceptance of our products and services.

We have historically funded our operations with cash from operations, equity financings, and borrowings from the issuance of debt, including our existing line of credit with U.S. Bank N.A.
Cash was $24,070,322 and $20,345,330 at June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. This 18% increase is principally the result of growth in both software and MarketPlace revenue, collection of accounts receivable, and extinguished debt.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the Board of Directors and
Stockholders of Park City Group, Inc.
Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Park City Group, Inc. (the Company) as of June 30, 2021 and 2020, and the related statements of income, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended June 30, 2021, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of June 30, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended June 30, 2021, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.
Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matters
The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.
Revenue Recognition - Multiple Element Arrangements
Description of the Matter:
The Company recognized approximately $21 million in revenue during the year ended June 30, 2021. As discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements, the Company enters into several different types of revenue arrangements that often consist of multiple performance obligations. Management must use judgment to determine the appropriate value and allocation of revenue to these performance obligations.
Auditing management’s assumptions and judgments can be complex, involves judgment, and requires a thorough understanding of the Company’s various revenue streams.
How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit:
We obtained and reviewed documentation to support the revenue recognition criteria. We tested performance obligations by reviewing the underlying contracts, evaluating management’s determination of the method and timing of measuring revenue, and testing management’s allocation of revenue to the performance obligations. Lastly, we tested the design and operating effectiveness of internal controls over the revenue cycle as well as the Information Technology General Controls as these heavily impact the revenue cycle.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
June 30, 2021 and June 30, 2020
NOTE 1.
DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
Summary of Business
Park City Group, Inc., a Nevada corporation (“Park City Group”, “We”, “us”, “our” or the “Company”) is a Software-as-a-Service (“SaaS”) provider, and the parent company of ReposiTrak, Inc., a Utah corporation (“ReposiTrak”) which operates a business-to-business (“B2B”) e-commerce, compliance, and supply chain management platform that partners with retailers, wholesalers, and product suppliers to help them source, vet, and transact with their suppliers in order to accelerate sales, control risks, and improve supply chain efficiencies, and source hard-to-get-things.
The Company’s services are grouped in three application suites: (i) ReposiTrak MarketPlace (“MarketPlace”), encompassing the Company’s supplier discovery and B2B e-commerce solutions, which helps the Company’s customers find new suppliers, (ii) ReposiTrak Compliance and Food Safety (“Compliance and Food Safety”) solutions, which help the Company’s customers vet suppliers to mitigate the risk of doing business with these suppliers, and (iii) ReposiTrak’s Supply Chain (“Supply Chain”) solutions, which help the Company’s customers to more efficiently manage their various transactions with their suppliers.
Recent Developments
During the second half of fiscal year 2021, ReposiTrak launched two new products designed to expand market share in the manufacturing segment: Certificate of Analysis Automation and Active-QMS for Quality Management. Both solutions were developed at the request of existing Compliance Management Solution customers and improve competitiveness in the manufacturing/food supply chain with synergistic solutions for growth in existing customers and increasing competitiveness for new business focused on quality management.
The quality management solution also has application in the retail sector, in central commissaries, distribution centers, and even task management in stores.
Another major new product initiative commenced in February 2021, as ReposiTrak joined with a group of major retailers and wholesalers to form the Food Traceability Leadership Consortium (FTLC), in response to the FDA’s announcement regarding the increase of food traceability requirements under the Food Safety Modernization Act. The expanded traceability requirements proposed by the FDA have far reaching consequences for the US food supply chain, from farms to fisheries down to retail stores, due to new, detailed documentation requirements designed to support more effective recalls.
These new proposed requirements create substantial data and records management challenges for all supply chain trading partners, many of whom do not have this capability today. The risk is that the supply chain will become fractious array of inoperable systems that could lead to massive operational complexity and expense escalation. The FTLC founding members worked collaboratively with ReposiTrak to develop a complete food traceability solution that meets all the FDA FSMA proposed reporting requirements at a very large manageable cost, based on the ReposiTrak supply chain platform which tracks product/shipment data in a similar manner today for cost and inventory control purposes.
The new solution, called the ReposiTrak Traceability Network, is launching in September 2021 with phased roll outs at suppliers and retailers, and is expected to scale rapidly through out fiscal year 2022, based on the existing Compliance Management user network.
COVID-19. There are many uncertainties regarding COVID-19, and the Company is closely monitoring the impact of the pandemic on all aspects of its business, including how it will impact its services, customers, employees, vendors, and business partners. While the pandemic did not materially adversely affect the Company’s financial results and business operations during the fiscal years ended June 30, 2021 or June 30, 2020, we are unable to predict the impact that COVID-19 will have on its future financial position and operating results due to numerous uncertainties. The Company expects to continue to assess the evolving impact of COVID-19 and intends to make adjustments to its responses accordingly.
Paycheck Protection Loan. On April 23, 2020, the Company received proceeds from a loan in the amount of approximately $1.1 million from its lender, U.S. Bank National Association (the “Lender”), pursuant to approval by the U.S. Small Business Administration (the “SBA”) for the Lender to fund the Company’s request for a loan under the SBA’s Paycheck Protection Program (“PPP Loan”) created as part of the CARES Act administered by the SBA. On December 19, 2020, the SBA authorized full forgiveness in the amount of approximately $1.1 million under the PPP Loan, and the Company will not need to make any payments on the PPP Loan that U.S. Bank National Association facilitates as an SBA lender. U.S. Bank National Association has applied the forgiveness amount the SBA authorized, plus all accrued interest, to the Company’s PPP Loan. The requirements under this program are established by the SBA. All requests for PPP Loan forgiveness are subject to SBA eligibility.
NOTE 2.
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Principles of Consolidation
The financial statements presented herein reflect the consolidated financial position of Park City Group and our Subsidiaries. All inter-company transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that materially affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements. Actual results could differ from these estimates. The methods, estimates, and judgments the Company uses in applying its most critical accounting policies have a significant impact on the results it reports in its financial statements. The Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) has defined the most critical accounting policies as those that are most important to the portrayal of the Company’s financial condition and results and require the Company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments, often because of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. Based on this definition, the Company’s most critical accounting policies include revenue recognition, goodwill, other long-lived asset valuations, income taxes, stock-based compensation, and capitalization of software development costs.
Concentration of Credit Risk and Significant Customers
The Company maintains cash in bank deposit accounts, which, at times, may exceed federally insured limits. The Company has not experienced any losses in such accounts and believes it is not exposed to any significant credit risk on cash and cash equivalents. Financial instruments, which potentially subject the Company to concentration of credit risk, consist primarily of trade receivables. In the normal course of business, the Company provides credit terms to its customers. Accordingly, the Company performs ongoing evaluations of its customers and maintains allowances for possible losses. The provision is based on the overall composition of our accounts receivable aging, our prior history of accounts receivable write-offs, and our experience with specific customers.
Other factors indicating significant risk include customers that have filed for bankruptcy or customers for which we have less payment history to rely upon. We rely on historical trends of bad debt as a percentage of total revenue and apply these percentages to the accounts receivable which when realized have been within the range of management’s expectations. The Company does not require collateral from its customers.
The Company’s accounts receivable are derived from sales of products and services primarily to customers operating multilocation retail and grocery stores. The Company writes off accounts receivable when they are determined to be uncollectible. Changes in the allowances for doubtful accounts are recorded as bad debt expense and are included in general and administrative expense in our consolidated financial statements. Amounts that have been invoiced are recorded in accounts receivable (current and long-term), and in deferred revenue or revenue, depending on whether the revenue recognition criteria have been met.
The Company had two customers that accounted for greater than 10% of accounts receivable at June 30, 2021. Customer A had a balance of $967,300 and $0 and customer B had a balance of $404,155 and $122,000, for June 30, 2021 and June 30, 2020, respectively.
Prepaid Expense and Other Current Assets
Prepaid expense and other current assets include amounts for which payment has been made but the services have not yet been consumed. The Company’s prepaid expense is made up primarily of prepayments for hosted software applications used in the Company’s operations, maintenance agreements on hardware and software, and other miscellaneous amounts for insurance, membership fees and professional fees. Prepaid expense is amortized on a pro-rata basis to expense accounts as the services are consumed typically by the passage of time or as the service is used.
Depreciation and Amortization
Depreciation and amortization of property and equipment is computed using the straight-line method based on the following estimated useful lives:
Years
Furniture and fixtures
5-7
Computer equipment
Equipment under capital leases
Long-term use equipment
Leasehold improvements
See below
Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the remaining lease term or the estimated useful life of the improvements.
Amortization of intangible assets are computed using the straight-line method based on the following estimated useful lives:
Years
Customer relationships
Acquired developed software
Developed software
Goodwill
See below
Goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are subject to annual impairment tests. Other intangible assets are amortized over their useful lives.
Warranties
The Company offers a limited warranty against software defects. Customers who are not completely satisfied with their software purchase may attempt to be reimbursed for their purchases outside the warranty period. For the years ending June 30, 2021 and 2020, the Company did not incur any expense associated with warranty claims.
Adoption of ASC 718, Compensation - Stock Compensation
From time to time, the Company issues shares of common stock as share-based compensation to employees and non-employees. The Company accounts for its share-based compensation to employees in accordance with FASB ASC 718, Compensation - Stock Compensation. Stock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date, based on the estimated fair value of the award, and is recognized as expense over the requisite service or vesting period.
In prior periods through September 30, 2019, the Company accounted for share-based compensation issued to non-employees and consultants in accordance with the provisions of FASB ASC 505-50, Equity - Based Payments to Non-Employees. Measurement of share-based payment transactions with non-employees is based on the fair value of whichever is more reliably measurable: (a) the goods or services received; or (b) the equity instruments issued. The final fair value of the share-based payment transaction is determined at the performance completion date. For interim periods, the fair value is estimated, and the percentage of completion is applied to that estimate to determine the cumulative expense recorded.
The Company adopted the standard during the second quarter of fiscal year 2020. This standard did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
Adoption of ASU 2016-02 “Leases (Topic 842)”
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02 “Leases (Topic 842)”. Under the new guidance, lessees will be required to recognize for all leases (with the exception of short-term leases) a lease liability, which is a lessee’s obligation to make lease payments arising from a lease, measured on a discounted basis and a right-of-use asset, which is an asset that represents the lessee’s right to use, or control the use of, a specified asset for the lease term.
Effective July 1, 2019, the Company adopted the requirements of Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-02, ""Leases (Topic 842)"" (""ASU 2016-02""). All amounts and disclosures set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K have been updated to comply with this new standard with results for reporting periods beginning after July 1, 2019 presented under ASU 2016-02, while prior period amounts and disclosures are not adjusted and continue to be reported under the accounting standards in effect for the prior period.
The Company adopted the requirements of ASU 2016-02 utilizing the modified retrospective method of transition to identified leases as of July 1, 2019 (the “effective date”). The recognition of additional operating lease liabilities was $82,517 for the current portion and $760,172 for the long-term portion and corresponding operating right-of-use assets were recorded in the amount of $842,689. This represents the operating lease existing as of the effective date which has a lease term of three years with the option for two additional three-year terms.
On June 21, 2018, the Company entered into an office lease at 5258 South Commerce Drive Suite D292, Murray, Utah 84107, providing for the lease of approximately 9,800 square feet, commencing on March 1, 2019. The monthly rent is $10,200. The initial term of the lease is three years. The Company has the option of renewing for an additional two three-year terms.
Revenue Recognition
The Company recognizes revenue as it transfers control of deliverables (products, solutions and services) to its customers in an amount reflecting the consideration to which it expects to be entitled. To recognize revenue, the Company applies the following five step approach: (1) identify the contract with a customer, (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract, (3) determine the transaction price, (4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract, and (5) recognize revenue when a performance obligation is satisfied. The Company accounts for a contract based on the terms and conditions the parties agree to, the contract has commercial substance and collectability of consideration is probable. The Company applies judgment in determining the customer’s ability and intention to pay, which is based on a variety of factors including the customer’s historical payment experience.
The Company may enter into arrangements that consist of multiple performance obligations. Such arrangements may include any combination of its deliverables. To the extent a contract includes multiple promised deliverables, the Company applies judgment to determine whether promised deliverables are capable of being distinct and are distinct in the context of the contract. If these criteria are not met, the promised deliverables are accounted for as a combined performance obligation. For arrangements with multiple distinct performance obligations, the Company allocates consideration among the performance obligations based on their relative standalone selling price. Standalone selling price is the price at which the Company would sell a promised good or service separately to the customer. When not directly observable, the Company typically estimates standalone selling price by using the expected cost plus a margin approach. The Company typically establishes a standalone selling price range for its deliverables, which is reassessed on a periodic basis or when facts and circumstances change.
For performance obligations where control is transferred over time, revenue is recognized based on the extent of progress towards completion of the performance obligation. The selection of the method to measure progress towards completion requires judgment and is based on the nature of the deliverables to be provided. Revenue related to fixed-price contracts for application development and systems integration services, consulting or other technology services is recognized as the service is performed using the output method, under which the total value of revenue is recognized based on each contract’s deliverable(s) as they are completed and when value is transferred to a customer. Revenue related to fixed-price application maintenance, testing and business process services is recognized based on our right to invoice for services performed for contracts in which the invoicing is representative of the value being delivered, in accordance with the practical expedient in ASC 606-10-55-18.
If the Company’s invoicing is not consistent with the value delivered, revenue is recognized as the service is performed based on the method described above. The output method measures the results achieved and value transferred to a customer, which is updated as the project progresses to reflect the latest available information; such estimates and changes in estimates involve the use of judgment. The cumulative impact of any revision in estimates is reflected in the financial reporting period in which the change in estimate becomes known and any anticipated losses on contracts are recognized immediately. Revenue related to fixed-price hosting and infrastructure services is recognized based on the Company’s right to invoice for services performed for contracts in which the invoicing is representative of the value being delivered, in accordance with the practical expedient in ASC 606-10-55-18. If the Company’s invoicing is not consistent with value delivered, revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis unless revenue is earned and obligations are fulfilled in a different pattern. The revenue recognition method applied to the types of contracts described above provides the most faithful depiction of performance towards satisfaction of the Company’s performance obligations.
Revenue related to the Company’s software license arrangements that do not require significant modification or customization of the underlying software is recognized when the software is delivered as control is transferred at a point in time. For software license arrangements that require significant functionality enhancements or modification of the software, revenue for the software license and related services is recognized as the services are performed in accordance with the methods described above. In software hosting arrangements, the rights provided to the customer, such as ownership of a license, contract termination provisions and the feasibility of the client to operate the software, are considered in determining whether the arrangement includes a license or a service. Revenue related to software maintenance and support is generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the contract period.
Management expects that incremental commission fees paid as a result of obtaining a contract are recoverable and therefore the Company capitalized them as contract costs. The Company recognizes the incremental costs of obtaining contracts as an expense when incurred if the amortization period of the asset that the Company otherwise would have recognized is one year or less.
Revenue related to transaction-based or volume-based contracts is recognized over the period the services are provided in a manner that corresponds with the value transferred to the customer to-date relative to the remaining services to be provided.
From time to time, the Company may enter into arrangements with third party suppliers to resell products or services. In such cases, the Company evaluates whether the Company is the principal (i.e. report revenue on a gross basis) or agent (i.e. report revenue on a net basis). In doing so, the Company first evaluates whether it controls the good or service before it is transferred to the customer. If the Company controls the good or service before it is transferred to the customer, the Company is the principal; if not, the Company is the agent. Determining whether the Company controls the good or service before it is transferred to the customer may require judgment.
The Company provides customers with assurance that the related deliverable will function as the parties intended because it complies with agreed-upon specifications. General updates or patch fixes are not considered an additional performance obligation in the contract.
Variable consideration is estimated using either the sum of probability weighted amounts in a range of possible consideration amounts (expected value), or the single most likely amount in a range of possible consideration amounts (most likely amount), depending on which method better predicts the amount of consideration to which we may be entitled. The Company includes in the transaction price variable consideration only to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal of revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is resolved. The Company’s estimates of variable consideration and determination of whether to include estimated amounts in the transaction price may involve judgment and is based largely on an assessment of its anticipated performance and all information that is reasonably available to the Company.
The Company assesses the timing of the transfer of goods or services to the customer as compared to the timing of payments to determine whether a significant financing component exists. As a practical expedient, the Company does not assess the existence of a significant financing component when the difference between payment and transfer of deliverables is a year or less. If the difference in timing arises for reasons other than the provision of finance to either the customer or us, no financing component is deemed to exist. The primary purpose of the Company’s invoicing terms is to provide customers with simplified and predictable ways of purchasing its services, not to receive or provide financing from or to customers. The Company does not consider set up or transition fees paid upfront by its customers to represent a financing component, as such fees are required to encourage customer commitment to the project and protect us from early termination of the contract.
Trade Accounts Receivable and Contract Balances
We classify our right to consideration in exchange for deliverables as either a receivable or a contract asset (unbilled receivable). A receivable is a right to consideration that is unconditional (i.e. only the passage of time is required before payment is due). For example, we recognize a receivable for revenue related to our transaction or volume-based contracts when earned regardless of whether amounts have been billed. We present such receivables in trade accounts receivable, net in our consolidated statements of financial position at their net estimated realizable value. We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts to provide for the estimated amount of receivables that may not be collected. The allowance is based upon an assessment of customer creditworthiness, historical payment experience, the age of outstanding receivables, judgment, and other applicable factors.
A contract asset is a right to consideration that is conditional upon factors other than the passage of time. Contract assets are presented in current and other assets in our consolidated balance sheets and primarily relate to unbilled amounts on fixed-price contracts utilizing the output method of revenue recognition. The table below shows movements in contract assets:

(1) Contract asset balances for June 30, 2021 include a current and a long-term contract asset, $1,248,936 and $408,925, respectively.
Our contract assets and liabilities are reported at the end of each reporting period. The difference between the opening and closing balances of our contract assets and deferred revenue primarily results from the timing difference between our performance obligations and the customer’s payment. We receive payments from customers based on the terms established in our contracts, which may vary generally by contract type.
The table below shows movements in the deferred revenue balances (current and noncurrent) for the period:

Our contract assets and liabilities are reported in a net position on a contract by contract basis at the end of each reporting period. The difference between the opening and closing balances of our contract assets and deferred revenue primarily results from the timing difference between our performance obligations and the customer’s payment. We receive payments from customers based on the terms established in our contracts, which may vary generally by contract type.
Disaggregation of Revenue
The table below presents disaggregated revenue from contracts with customers by contract-type. All revenues for the years ending June 30, 2020 and 2021 were generated from sales in North America. We believe this disaggregation best depicts the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of our revenue and cash flows that may be affected by industry, market and other economic factors:

Software Development Costs
The Company accounts for research costs of computer software to be sold, leased or otherwise marketed as expense until technological feasibility has been established for the product. Once technological feasibility is established, the company will occasionally capitalize software costs until the product is available for general release to customers. In these instances, the Company determines technological feasibility for its software products to have been reached when a working prototype is complete and meets or exceeds design specifications including functions, features, and technical performance requirements. The Company capitalized software development costs of $171,733 in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021.
Research and Development Costs
Research and development costs include personnel costs, engineering, consulting, and contract labor and are expensed as incurred for software that has not achieved technological feasibility.
Advertising Costs
Advertising is expensed as incurred. Advertising costs were approximately $5,000 and $54,048 for the years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
Income Taxes
The Company recognizes deferred tax liabilities and assets for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between tax bases and financial reporting bases of other assets and liabilities.
Earnings Per Share
Basic net income per common share (“Basic EPS”) excludes dilution and is computed by dividing net income applicable to common shareholders by the weighted average number of shares of the Company’s common stock, par value $0.01 (“Common Stock”) outstanding during the period. Diluted net income per common share (“Diluted EPS”) reflects the potential dilution that could occur if stock options or other contracts to issue shares of Common Stock were exercised or converted into Common Stock. The computation of Diluted EPS does not assume exercise or conversion of securities that would have an antidilutive effect on net income per share of Common Stock.
For the years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020 warrants to purchase 1,085,068 shares of Common Stock were included in the computation of diluted EPS and warrants to purchase 23,737 shares were excluded due to the anti-dilutive effect. Warrants to purchase shares of Common Stock were outstanding at prices ranging $4.00 from to $10.00 per share at June 30, 2021.
The following table presents the components of the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share for the periods indicated:

Stock-Based Compensation
The Company recognizes the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments based on the grant-date fair value of those awards. The Company records compensation expense on a straight-line basis. The fair value of options granted are estimated at the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option pricing model with assumptions for the risk-free interest rate, expected life, volatility, dividend yield and forfeiture rate.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of twelve months or less to be cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents are stated at fair value.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The Company’s financial instruments consist of cash, cash equivalents, receivables, payables, accruals and notes payable. The carrying amount of cash, cash equivalents, receivables, payables and accruals approximates fair value due to the short-term nature of these items. The notes payable also approximate fair value based on evaluations of market interest rates.

INCOME TAXES
Deferred taxes are provided on a liability method whereby deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards and deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable differences. Temporary differences are the differences between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment. Due to the tax rates being changed in 2018 we have used a federal and state blended rate of 26%.
Net deferred tax liabilities consist of the following components at June 30:
Deferred tax assets:
NOL carryover
$17,044,800
$27,788,000

At June 30, 2021, the Company had net operating loss carry-forwards of approximately $65,557,000 that may be offset against past and future taxable income from the year 2020 through 2037. A significant portion of the net operating loss carryforwards began to expire in 2019. No tax benefit has been reported in the June 30, 2021 consolidated financial statements since the potential tax benefit is offset by a valuation allowance of the same amount.
Due to the change in ownership provisions of the Tax Reform Act of 1986, net operating loss carryforwards for Federal income tax reporting purposes are subject to annual limitations. In January of 2009 the Company acquired Prescient Applied Intelligence, Inc. which had significant net operating loss carry-forwards. Due to the change in ownership, Prescient's net operating loss carryforwards may be limited as to use in future years. The limitation will be determined on a year-to-year basis. In June of 2015 the Company acquired Repositrak, Inc. which had significant net operating loss carryforwards. Due to the change in ownership, Repositrak's net operating loss carryforwards may be limited as to use in future years. The limitation will be determined on a year-to-year basis.
The Company determines whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination based upon the technical merits of the position. If the more-likely-than-not threshold is met, the Company measures the tax position to determine the amount to recognize in the financial statements. The Company performed a review of its material tax positions in accordance with these recognition and measurement standards.
The Company has concluded that there are no significant uncertain tax positions requiring disclosure, and there are not material amounts of unrecognized tax benefits.
The Company includes interest and penalties arising from the underpayment of income taxes in the consolidated statements of operations in the provision for income taxes. As of June 30, 2021, the Company had no accrued interest or penalties related to uncertain tax positions.
The Company files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various state jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state and local income tax examinations by tax authorities for years before June 30, 2018.

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
Leases
On May 1, 2019, the Company completed the expansion of new equipment for the Company’s information technology infrastructure, buildout of its corporate headquarters, and expansion of its collocation data center, which it completed using approximately $1,269,000 (the “Lease Amount”) of funds provided by U.S. Bank to finance equipment and services related to the Company’s expansion and relocation pursuant to that certain lease agreement, originally entered into by and between the Company and U.S. Bank on January 9, 2019 (the “Lease Agreement”). Pursuant to the Lease Agreement, as of May 1, 2019, U.S. Bank is now leasing back the property and equipment purchased by the Company. Pursuant to the Lease Agreement, commencing May 1, 2019, the initial term of the lease shall be 48 months, the Lease Amount shall accrue interest at a rate of 5.0% per annum, and the Company shall be required to make monthly rental payments in the amount of approximately $29,097 per month. On July 30, 2020 the Company made an early repayment of the entire outstanding balance on the note payable due to U.S. Bank in the amount of $960,208. The repayment amount included $64,721 of accrued interest. No repayment penalties were incurred as a result of the transaction.
On June 21, 2018 the Company entered into an office lease at 5252 South Commerce Drive Suite D292, Murray, Utah 84107, providing for the lease of approximately 9,800 square feet for a period of three years, commencing on March 1, 2019. The monthly rent is $10,200.
Minimum future payments, including principal and interest, under the non-cancelable capital leases are as follows:
Year ending June 30:
$81,600
From time to time the Company may enter into or exit from diminutive operating lease agreements for equipment such as copiers, temporary back up servers, etc. These leases are not of a material amount and thus will not in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operation or liquidity.
NOTE 13.
EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLAN
The Company offers an employee benefit plan under Benefit Plan Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. Employees who have attained the age of 18 are eligible to participate. The Company, at its discretion, may match employee’s contributions at a percentage determined annually by the Board of Directors. The Company does not currently match contributions. There were no expenses for the years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020.
NOTE 14.
STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY
Officers and Directors Stock Compensation
Effective October 2018, the Board of Directors approved the following compensation for directors who are not employed by the Company:
●
Annual cash compensation of $75,000 payable at the rate of $18,750 per quarter. The Company has the right to pay this amount in the form of shares of the Company’s Common Stock.
●
Upon appointment, outside independent directors receive a grant of $150,000 payable in shares of the Company’s restricted Common Stock calculated based on the market value of the shares of Common Stock on the date of grant. The shares vest ratably over a five-year period.
●
Reimbursement of all travel expense related to performance of Directors’ duties on behalf of the Company.
Officers, Key Employees, Consultants and Directors Stock Compensation.
In January 2013, the Board of Directors approved the Second Amended and Restated 2011 Stock Plan (the “Amended 2011 Plan”), which Amended 2011 Plan was approved by shareholders on March 29, 2013. Under the terms of the Amended 2011 Plan, all employees, consultants and directors of the Company are eligible to participate. The maximum aggregate number of shares of Common Stock that may be granted under the Amended 2011 Plan is 675,000 shares.
A Committee of independent members of the Company’s Board of Directors administers the Amended 2011 Plan. The exercise price for each share of Common Stock purchasable under any incentive stock option granted under the Amended 2011 Plan shall be not less than 100% of the fair market value of the Common Stock, as determined by the stock exchange on which the Common Stock trades on the date of grant. If the incentive stock option is granted to a shareholder who possesses more than 10% of the Company’s voting power, then the exercise price shall be not less than 110% of the fair market value on the date of grant. Each option shall be exercisable in whole or in installments as determined by the Committee at the time of the grant of such options. All incentive stock options expire after 10 years. If the incentive stock option is held by a shareholder who possesses more than 10% of the Company's voting power, then the incentive stock option expires after five years. If the option holder is terminated, then the incentive stock options granted to such holder expire no later than three months after the date of termination. For option holders granted incentive stock options exercisable for the first time during any fiscal year and in excess of $100,000 (determined by the fair market value of the shares of Common Stock as of the grant date), the excess shares of Common Stock shall not be deemed to be purchased pursuant to incentive stock options.
During the years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020 the Company issued 40,883 and 61,551 shares to its directors and 37,575 and 41,747 shares to employees and consultants, respectively, under the Amended 2011 Plan. The Company, under its Share Repurchase Program, repurchased 211,008 and 412,185 shares of its Common Stock during the years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Those shares were cancelled and returned to authorized but unissued shares. The Company holds no Treasury Stock. Vested and issued shares under the Amended 2011 plan for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2021 and June 30, 2020, totaling 9,357 and 16,059, respectively are included in the rollforward of Restricted Stock units below.

Preferred Stock
The Company’s articles of incorporation currently authorizes the issuance of up to 30,000,000 shares of ‘blank check’ preferred stock, par value $0.01 (“Preferred Stock”) with designations, rights, and preferences as may be determined from time to time by the Company’s Board of Directors, of which 700,000 shares are currently designated as Series B Preferred Stock (“Series B Preferred”) and 550,000 shares are designated as Series B-1 Preferred Stock (“Series B-1 Preferred”). Both classes of Series B Preferred Stock pay dividends at a rate of 7% per annum if paid by the Company in cash, or 9% if paid by the Company by the issuance of additional shares of Series B Preferred, or Series B-1 Preferred, as applicable.
The Company does business with some of the largest retailers and wholesalers in the World. Management believes the Series B-1 Preferred favorably impacts the Company’s overall cost of capital in that it is: (i) perpetual and, therefore, an equity instrument that positively impacts the Company’s coverage ratios, (ii) possesses a below market dividend rate relative to similar instruments, (iii) offers the flexibility of a paid-in-kind (PIK) payment option, and (iv) is without covenants. After exploring alternative options for redeeming the Series B-1 Preferred, management determined that alternative financing options were materially more expensive, or would impair the Company’s net cash position, which management believes could cause customer concerns and negatively impact the Company’s ability to attract new business.
Section 4 of the Company’s First Amended and Restated Certificate of Designation of the Relative Rights, Powers and Preferences of the Series B-1 Preferred Stock, as amended (the “Series B-1 COD”) provides the Company’s Board of Directors with the right to redeem any or all of the outstanding shares of the Company’s Series B-1 Preferred for a cash payment of $10.70 per share at any time upon providing the holders of Series B-1 Preferred at least ten days written notice that sets forth the date on which the redemption will occur (the “Redemption Notice”).
As of June 30, 2021, a total of 625,375 shares of Series B Preferred and 212,402 shares of Series B-1 Preferred were issued and outstanding.
Share Repurchase Program
On May 9, 2019, our Board of Directors approved of the repurchase of up to $4.0 million shares of our Common Stock, which repurchases may be made in privately negotiated transactions or in the open market at prices per share not exceeding the then-current market prices (the “Share Repurchase Program”). Under the Share Repurchase Program, management has discretion to determine the dollar amount of shares to be repurchased and the timing of any repurchases in compliance with applicable laws and regulations, including Rule 12b-18 of the Exchange Act. On March 17, 2020, given the extreme uncertainty due to COVID-19 at the time, the Board suspended the Share Repurchase Program.
On May 18, 2021, our Board of Directors resumed its Share Repurchase Program, and increased the buyback from $4 million to $6 million. The Share Repurchase Program expires 24 months following May 18, 2021, and it may be suspended for periods of time or discontinued at any time, at the Board’s discretion. The total remaining authorization for future shares of Common Stock repurchases under our Share Repurchase Program was $2,050,885 as of June 30, 2021. From time-to-time, our Board may authorize further increases to our Share Repurchase Program.

RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-15 Intangibles - Goodwill and Other Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40) - Customer’s Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement That is a Service Contract. The amendments in this update apply to an entity who is a customer in a hosting arrangement accounted for as a service contract. The update requires a customer in a hosting arrangement to capitalize certain implementation costs. Costs associated with the application development stage of the implementation should be capitalized and costs with the other stages should be expensed. For instance, costs for training and data conversion should be expensed. The capitalized implementation costs should be expensed over the term of the hosting arrangement, which is the noncancelable period plus periods covered by an option to extend if the customer is reasonably certain to exercise the option. Impairment of the capitalized costs should be considered similar to other intangibles. The effective date of this update is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019 for public entities and after December 15, 2020 for all other entities with early adoption permitted. The Company is a customer in a hosting arrangement and may enter into new arrangements in the future. The Company adopted the standard during the second quarter of fiscal year 2020. This standard did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-13 Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820) Disclosure Framework - Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement. This ASU eliminates, amends, and adds disclosure requirements for fair value measurements. The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company adopted the standard during the second quarter of fiscal year 2020. This standard did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
In June 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-07 Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718), Improvements to Nonemployee Share-Based Payment Accounting. The amendments in this update expand the scope of Topic 718 to include share-based payment transactions for acquiring goods and services from nonemployees. Prior to this update, equity-based payments to non-employees was accounted for under Subtopic 505-50 resulting in significant differences between the accounting for share-based payments to non-employees as compared to employees. One of the most significant changes is that non-employee share-based awards (classified as equity awards) may be measured at grant-date fair value and not have to be continually revalued until the service/goods are rendered. The update also indicates that share-based awards related to financing and awards granted to a customer in conjunction with selling goods or services are not included in Topic 718. This standard is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018 for public entities and December 15, 2019 for all other entities. Early adoption is permitted, but no earlier than an entity’s adoption date of Topic 606. The Company adopted the standard during the first quarter of fiscal year 2020. This standard did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04 Intangibles-Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment, which amends and simplifies the accounting standard for goodwill impairment. The new standard removes Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test, which requires a hypothetical purchase price allocation. A goodwill impairment will now be the amount a reporting unit’s carrying value exceeds its fair value, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. The new standard is effective for annual and any interim impairment tests for periods beginning after December 15, 2019. The Company adopted the standard during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020. This standard did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02 Leases (Topic 842). Under the new guidance, lessees will be required to recognize for all leases (with the exception of short-term leases) a lease liability, which is a lessee’s obligation to make lease payments arising from a lease, measured on a discounted basis and a right-of-use asset, which is an asset that represents the lessee’s right to use, or control the use of, a specified asset for the lease term.
Effective July 1, 2019, the Company adopted the requirements of Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) (""ASU 2016-02"").

BUSINESS
Overview
Proofpoint is a leading next-generation cybersecurity company that enables primarily large and mid-sized organizations worldwide to protect the way their people work from advanced threats and compliance risks. Our integrated suite of products works together to help organizations build people-centric security and compliance programs. We provide threat protection, information protection, user protection, business ecosystem protection, and compliance solutions to address today’s rapidly changing threat and compliance landscape. Our solutions are built on a flexible, cloud-based platform and leverage proprietary technologies - including big data analytics, machine learning, deep content inspection, secure storage, advanced encryption, intelligent message routing, dynamic malware analysis, threat correlation, and virtual execution environments.
Every company’s greatest asset and greatest security risk is its people. Cyberattacks have fundamentally shifted from targeting infrastructure to targeting people, relying on tricking users into running code, divulging their passwords, or even sending money or data. This transformation of the threat landscape manifests in nearly every form of cyber threat, from nation state advanced persistent threat (“APT”) actors relying on phishing, through to cybercriminals launching massive ransomware email campaigns, and more targeted campaigns designed to steal valuable data from both legacy and cloud-based systems. At the same time, the rapid adoption of cloud applications has increased organizations’ attack surface by moving both threats and sensitive data away from the traditional network perimeter, reducing the effectiveness of many existing security products. These factors have contributed to an increasing number of severe data breaches and expanding regulatory mandates, notably the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), all of which have accelerated demand for effective threat protection and compliance solutions.
Our platform addresses this growing challenge by not only protecting data as it flows into and out of the enterprise via on-premises and cloud-based email, social media, and other cloud applications, but also by keeping track of this information as it is modified and distributed throughout the enterprise for compliance and data loss prevention, and securely archiving these communications for compliance and discovery. We help organizations reduce their critical risk in five major ways:
•
Protecting users from the advanced attacks that target them via email, web, networks, social media, and cloud apps;
•
Preventing the theft or inadvertent loss of sensitive information and, in turn, ensuring compliance with regulatory data protection mandates;
•
Improving the resilience of end users to the threats that target them and training them to be better caretakers of their organizations’ critical data;
•
Collecting, retaining, supervising and discovering communications and sensitive data for compliance and litigation support; and
•
Enabling organizations to respond quickly to security issues, providing both the intelligence and the context to prioritize incidents and orchestrate remediation actions.
Our platform and its associated solutions are sold to customers on a subscription basis and can be deployed through our unique cloud-based architecture that leverages both our global data centers as well as optional points-of-presence behind our customers’ firewalls. Our flexible deployment model enables us to deliver superior security and compliance while maintaining the favorable economics afforded by cloud computing, creating a competitive advantage for us over legacy on-premises and cloud-only offerings.
We were founded in 2002 to provide a unified solution to help enterprises address their growing data security requirements. Our first solution was commercially released in 2003 to combat the burgeoning problem of spam and viruses and their impact on corporate email systems. To address the evolving threat landscape and the adoption of communication and collaboration systems beyond corporate email and networks, we have broadened our solutions to defend against a wide range of threats, including email, mobile apps and social media, to protect the information people create from both compromise and compliance risks, and to archive and govern corporate information. We market and sell our solutions worldwide both directly through our sales teams and indirectly through a hybrid model where our sales organization actively assists our network of distributors and resellers. We also distribute our solutions through strategic partners.
Proofpoint Solutions
Our integrated suite of on-demand security-as-a-service solutions enables large and mid-sized organizations to protect people throughout the enterprise from advanced attacks and compliance risks. Our comprehensive platform provides a secure email gateway, advanced threat protection, security awareness training, threat intelligence, email authentication, email encryption, data loss prevention, digital risk protection, cloud application protection, web browser isolation, archiving, e-discovery, and threat response capabilities. These solutions are built on a cloud-based architecture, protecting enterprises and their customers from inbound threats via email, social media, and mobile apps, while identifying and protecting enterprise data not only where it is stored within the enterprise but also as it transits beyond the organization’s borders such as via email or social media. We have pioneered the use of innovative technologies to deliver better ease-of-use, greater protection against the latest advanced threats, and lower total cost of ownership than traditional alternatives. The key elements of our solution include:
•
Superior protection against both advanced and targeted threats. We use a combination of proprietary technologies for big data analytics, machine learning, deep content inspection, static and dynamic malware analysis, protocol analysis, threat correlation, threat intelligence extraction, and virtual execution environments to predictively and actively detect and stop targeted “spear phishing” and other sophisticated advanced threats, including malicious attachments, polymorphic threats, zero-day exploits, user-transparent “drive-by” downloads, malicious web links, hybrid threats (such as links inserted into attached files), malware free attacks like impostor threats and credential phishing, and other penetration tactics. By processing, analyzing and correlating billions of data points on a daily basis, we can recognize anomalies in order to predictively detect targeted attacks before users are exposed. Our deep content inspection technology enables us to identify malicious message attachments and distinguish between valid messages and “phishing” messages designed to look authentic and trick the end user into divulging sensitive data or clicking on a malicious web link. Our machine learning technology enables us to detect targeted “zero-hour” attacks in real-time, even if they have not been seen previously at other locations, and quarantine them appropriately. Our dynamic malware analysis and virtual execution environment technologies enable us to examine web site destinations and downloadable files to identify and block potentially hostile code that would otherwise compromise end user computers, even in cases where the web sites are considered reputable or the attachment’s malicious payload is obfuscated or otherwise disguised. Our threat correlation technologies enable us to rapidly confirm and contain threats, providing rapid, automated protection. In addition, our threat intelligence and response capabilities enable our customers to both prioritize threats that may have compromised them and orchestrate or automate protective countermeasures.
•
Comprehensive, integrated email security, cloud security, advanced threat, information protection and archiving, and digital risk protection product families. We offer a comprehensive solution for email security that we believe is unparalleled in the market. Our Threat Protection product family includes solutions to protect organizations across the predominant threat vectors, including email, web, social media, and cloud applications. To protect enterprise data from security and compliance risks, our Information Protection product family includes a suite of security and compliance solutions. Finally, we enable organizations to look beyond their borders for threats targeting their customers across email phishing, malicious web domains, compromised cloud accounts, and fraudulent social media accounts.
•
Designed to empower end users. Unlike legacy offerings that simply block communication or report audit violations, our solutions actively enable secure business-to-business and business-to-consumer communications. Our easy-to-use policy-based email encryption service automatically encrypts sensitive emails and delivers them to any PC or mobile device. In addition, our secure file-transfer solution makes it easy for end users to securely share various forms of documents and other content that are typically too large to send through traditional e-mail systems. All our solutions provide mobile-optimized capabilities to empower the growing number of people who use mobile devices as their primary computing platform. We also provide solutions that train end users to be the last line of defense against cyber-attacks.
•
Security optimized cloud architecture. Our multi-tenant security-as-a-service solution leverages a distributed, scalable architecture deployed in our global data centers for deep content inspection, global threat correlation and analytics, high-speed search, secure storage, encryption key management, software updates, intelligent message routing, and other core functions. Our architecture also enables us to look across hundreds of billions of data points gathered from across our product portfolio and intelligence feeds to better correlate and analyze both targeted and broad-based threat campaigns. Customers can choose to deploy optional physical or virtual points-of-presence behind their firewalls for those who prefer to deploy certain functionality inside their security perimeter. This architecture enables us to leverage the benefits of the cloud to cost-effectively deliver superior security and compliance, while optimizing each deployment for the customer’s unique threat environment.
•
Extensible security-as-a-service platform. The key components of our security-as-a-service platform, including services for secure storage, content inspection, reputation, big data analytics, encryption, key management, and identity and policy, can be exposed through application programming interfaces, or APIs, to integrate with internally developed applications as well as with those developed by third-parties. In addition, these APIs provide a means to integrate with the other security and compliance components deployed in our customers’ infrastructures, including Proofpoint’s ecosystem partners.
Our Security-as-a-Service Platform
We provide a multi-tiered security-as-a-service platform consisting of solutions, platform technologies and infrastructure. Our platform currently includes product families and related bundles for the convenience of our customers, distributors and resellers. Each of these solutions is built as an aspect of our security-as-a-service platform, which includes both platform services and enabling technologies for both security and compliance. Our platform services provide the key functionality to enable our various solutions while our enabling technologies work in conjunction with our platform services to enable the efficient construction, scaling and maintenance of our customer-facing solutions.
Our suite is delivered by a cloud infrastructure and can be deployed as a secure cloud-only solution, or as a hybrid solution with optional physical or virtual points-of-presence behind our customers’ firewalls for those who prefer to deploy certain functionality inside their security perimeter. In all deployment scenarios, our cloud-based architecture enables us to leverage the benefits of the cloud to cost-effectively deliver superior security and compliance while maintaining the flexibility to optimize deployments for customers’ unique environments. The modularity of our solutions enables our existing customers to implement additional modules in a simple and efficient manner.

Protection from targeted attacks. Enterprises are protected against both commodity and advanced threats such as phishing and other targeted email attacks using big data analysis, predictive, virtual execution, static analysis, protocol analysis, and dynamic malware analysis techniques to identify and apply additional security controls against suspicious messages, attachments and any associated links to the web. The same detection techniques are extended to look for malicious content in enterprise social media accounts, malicious links and files sent to users via cloud applications. It also detects suspicious login activity that could indicate signs of account compromise.
•
Detection of compromised cloud accounts and internal email threats. We take a multi-layered approach to protect an organization’s internal email by scanning all internal email for spam, malicious attachments, and malicious URLs. We also provide automated protection of account compromise in Office 365 and other cloud applications via a Cloud Access Security Broker solution (“CASB”). These threats typically start with phishing or other techniques, such as credential-stealing malware and brute-force credential stuffing. Compromised accounts are then used to launch lateral attacks, everything from business email compromise (“BEC”) to internal phishing attacks, both inside and outside organizations.
•
Security orchestration to respond quickly to security alerts. Provides threat information and indicators of compromise (“IoCs”) correlation, aggregating across Proofpoint and other third-party security products, to confirm and contain system compromises. By taking advantage of this automated incident response, enterprises can minimize exfiltration windows and leverage staff for breach prevention and mitigation. In addition, it can be leveraged to automatically remove malicious emails that have been delivered to users’ email inboxes, reducing the potential risk exposure.
•
Web browser isolation. Allows end users to access websites and personal webmail from corporate devices while preventing malware or malicious content from impacting the user or device. In addition, it allows organizations to rewrite potentially malicious links in inbound emails to open in the protected isolation environment, eliminating the risk of the first click on a previously unseen threat.
•
Threat intelligence feed and ruleset. Verified threat intelligence from one of the world’s largest malware exchanges. Unlike other intelligence sources that report only domains or IP addresses, ET Intelligence includes a five-year history,
proof of conviction, more than 40 threat categories and related IPs, domains, and samples. This also comes in the form of a timely and accurate rule set for detecting and blocking threats using existing network security appliances-including next generation firewalls (“NGFW”) and network IDS/IPS.

Customers
As of December 31, 2020, we had customers of all sizes across a wide variety of industries. A number of our largest customers use our platform to protect more than a million users and handle over a billion messages per day. During the year ended December 31, 2020, two partners accounted for 13% and 11%, respectively, of total revenue. During the year ended December 31, 2019, two partners accounted for 12% and 11%, respectively, of total revenue. During the year ended December 31, 2018, one partner accounted for 12% of total revenue. These partners sold to a number of end users, none of which accounted for more than 10% of our total revenue in 2020, 2019 and 2018. In each year since the launch of our first solution in 2003, we have maintained a renewal rate with our existing customers of 90% or higher.
We had approximately 8,000 enterprise customers as of December 31, 2020, which consists of customers that generate more than $10,000 in annual recurring revenue, an increase of 13% as compared to December 31, 2019. Our enterprise customers included approximately 57% of the Fortune 1000 companies and 27% of the Global 2000 companies.
Sales and Marketing
Sales
We primarily target large and mid-sized organizations across all industries. Our sales and marketing programs are organized by geographic regions, including Asia-Pacific, EMEA, Japan, North America, and South America, and we further segment and organize our sales force into teams that focus on large enterprises (4,000 employees and above), mid-sized organizations (1,000 - 4,000 employees) and existing customers. In addition, we create integrated sales and marketing programs targeting specific vertical-markets. This vertical-market approach enables us to provide a higher level of service and understanding of our customers’ unique needs, including the industry-specific business and regulatory requirements in industries such as healthcare, financial services, retail and education.
We sell through both direct and indirect channels, including technology and channel partners:
•
Direct sales and reseller channel. We market and sell our solutions to large and mid-sized customers directly through our field and inside sales teams as well as indirectly through a hybrid model, where our sales organization actively assists our network of distributors and resellers. Our sales personnel are primarily located in North America, with additional personnel located in Asia-Pacific, EMEA, Japan and South America. Our reseller partners maintain relationships with their customers throughout the territories in which they operate, providing them with services and third-party solutions to help meet their evolving security requirements. As such, these partners act as a direct conduit through which we can connect with these prospective customers to offer our solutions. Our channel partners include security centric resellers such as CDW, Optiv, and AT&T, as well as distributors such as Ingram Micro and Exclusive Networks.
•
Strategic relationships. We also sell our solutions indirectly through key technology companies that offer our solutions in conjunction with one or more of their own products or services. These companies each have their own base of customers, and they distribute our products to augment their own branded products and solutions, sometimes under their own brand and sometimes under the Proofpoint brand. In addition, our Cloudmark division delivers email protection to many of the largest global internet service providers.
For sales involving a partner such as a distributor, reseller or strategic partner, the partner engages with the prospective customer directly and involves our sales team as needed to assist in developing and closing an order. At the conclusion of a successful sales cycle, we sell the associated subscription, hardware and services to the partner who in turn resells these items to the customer, with the partner earning a margin based on the amount paid to Proofpoint as compared to the amount charged to the customer. With the order completed, we provide these customers with direct access to our security-as-a-service platform and other associated services, enabling us to establish a direct relationship and provide them with support as part of ensuring that the customer has a good experience with our platform. At the end of the contract term, the partner engages with the customer to execute a renewal order, with our team providing assistance as required.
Marketing
We have a number of marketing initiatives to build awareness about our solutions and encourage customer adoption of our solutions. Our marketing programs include a variety of digital marketing, advertising, conferences, events, white-papers, public relations activities and web-based seminar campaigns targeted at key decision makers within our prospective customers.
We offer free trials, competitive evaluations, and free security and compliance risk assessments to allow prospective customers to experience the quality of our solutions, to learn in detail about the features and functionality of our suite, and to quantify the potential benefits of our solutions.
Customer Service and Support
We believe that our customer service and support provide a competitive advantage and are critical to retaining and expanding our customer base. We conduct regular third-party surveys to measure customer loyalty and satisfaction with our solutions.
Proofpoint Support Services
We deliver 24x7x365 customer support from support centers located in North America, EMEA and Asia-Pacific regions. We offer a wide range of support offerings with varying levels of access to our support resources.
Proofpoint Professional Services and Training
With our security-as-a-service model, our solutions are designed to be implemented, configured, and operated without the need for any training or professional services. For those customers that would like to develop deeper expertise in the use of our solutions or would like some assistance with complex configurations or the importing of data, we offer various training and professional services. Many implementation services can be completed in one day and are primarily provided remotely using web-based conferencing tools. If requested, our professional services organization also provides additional assistance with data importing, design, implementation, customization, or advanced reporting. We also offer a learning center for both in-person and online training and certification.
Research and Development
We devote significant resources to improve and enhance our existing security solutions and maintain the effectiveness of our platform, monitoring the threat landscape in real-time and making constant adjustments to remain effective as the threat landscape shifts. We also work closely with our customers to gain valuable insights into their threat environments and security management practices to assist us in designing new solutions and features that extend the data protection, archiving and governance capabilities of our platform. Our technical staff monitors and tests our software on a regular basis, and we maintain a regular release process to update and enhance our existing solutions. Leveraging our on-demand platform model, we can deploy real-time upgrades with no downtime.
Competition
Our markets are highly competitive, fragmented and subject to rapid changes in technology. We compete primarily with companies that offer a broad array of data protection and governance solutions. Providers of data protection solutions generally have product offerings that include threat protection, virus protection, data loss prevention, flexible remediation, data encryption, and in some cases secure file transfer. Providers of archiving solutions generally have product offerings that provide data storage, search, policy enforcement, legal-hold management, and in some cases supervision.
Key competitors include:
•
Email and Advanced Threat Protection: Broadcom Inc., Cisco Systems, Inc., FireEye, Inc., Google, Inc., Microsoft Corporation, and Mimecast Ltd.
•
Archiving: Micro Focus International plc, Microsoft Corporation, Mimecast Ltd and Veritas Technologies LLC.
•
Information Protection: Broadcom Inc., Forcepoint, McAfee Corp. and Netskope, Inc.
We believe we compete favorably based on the following factors:
•
effectiveness of our protection against advanced threats;
•
comprehensiveness and integration of the solution;
•
flexibility of delivery models;
•
total cost of ownership;
•
scalability and performance;
•
customer support; and
•
extensibility of platform.
Certain of our competitors have greater sales, marketing and financial resources, more extensive geographic presence and greater name recognition than we do. We may face future competition in our markets from other large, established companies, as well as from emerging companies. In addition, we expect that there is likely to be continued consolidation in our industry that could lead to increased price competition and other forms of competition.
Intellectual Property
We rely on a combination of trade secrets, patents, copyrights and trademarks, as well as contractual protections, to establish and protect our intellectual property rights and protect our proprietary technology. As of December 31, 2020, we had 198 patents and 91 patent applications. We have a number of registered and unregistered trademarks. We require our employees, consultants and other third parties to enter into confidentiality and proprietary rights agreements and control access to software, documentation and other proprietary information. Although we rely on intellectual property rights, including trade secrets, patents, copyrights and trademarks, as well as contractual protections to establish and protect our proprietary rights, we believe that factors such as the technological and creative skills of our personnel, creation of new modules, features and functionality, and frequent enhancements to our solutions are more essential to establishing and maintaining our technology leadership position.
Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary technology and our intellectual property rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or obtain and use our technology to develop products with the same functionality as our solution. Policing unauthorized use of our technology and intellectual property rights is difficult.
We expect that software and other solutions in our industry may be subject to third-party infringement claims as the number of competitors grows and the functionality of products in different industry segments overlaps. Any of these third parties might make a claim of infringement against us at any time.
Human Capital
People are at the core of our values and our people-centric cybersecurity strategy. As of December 31, 2020, the Company employed 3,658 people worldwide, of which approximately 70% were employed in the United States with the remaining 30% outside of the United States. None of our U.S. employees are represented by unions. However, there are employees outside of the United States that are represented by works councils in France and Germany.
The Company’s security and compliance products and services are created and supported through a global workforce passionate about the Company’s culture and cybersecurity vision. Our people-centric approach to cybersecurity is uniquely adept at protecting our customers’ greatest assets, their people, while addressing their greatest risks, their people. At Proofpoint, our people - and the diversity of their lived experiences and backgrounds, thinking and perspectives, and work skills and experiences - are the driving force behind much of our success. We encourage and value innovation at every level of our workforce. Our people include leaders across technical fields covering threat research, machine learning, analytics and cybersecurity engineering, to customer success, technical support, operations and information security. Our people, whether they are in sales, marketing, or general administrative functions, strive to understand the challenges and unique needs of our constituents and deliver predictable and efficient results.
Our Senior Vice-President, Human Resources (“SVPHR”), who reports directly to our Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”), leads the development and implementation of the Company’s human capital strategy, including the attraction, acquisition, development and engagement of talent; however, it is the responsibility of all of Proofpoint, its management and its employees, to execute and build a collaborative and engaging workplace where all employees have an opportunity to do their best work and where we act as a team to solve our customers’ most challenging security issues.
Our SVPHR, with our CEO and executive management team, are responsible for developing the Company’s diversity and inclusion vision and roadmap and integrating these into the Company’s culture and operations. The roadmap includes framing the Company's global policies and programs for leadership and talent development, compensation, benefits, staffing and workforce planning, human resources systems, education and organization development, workplace strategies, and global sourcing and indirect procurement, and ensuring effective and efficient internal company operations.
The CEO and SVPHR in concert regularly update our board of directors and the Compensation Committee on human capital matters.
Purpose/Culture
Proofpoint’s purpose and culture, which defines how we, as individuals and as a company, act are built on the following tenets:
•
Strive to Delight Our Customers and Protect Them from Advanced Cybersecurity and Compliance Threats
•
Take Initiative and Drive Accountability
•
Act with Honesty and Integrity
•
Innovate in All Aspects of Our Business
•
Be Here to Win
•
Show up with a Team Mentality
These cultural tenets allow our workforce to relentlessly pursue one of our central purposes: to earn our customers’ trust every day. We strive to earn this trust by:
•
Acting with honesty and integrity - this is foundational to our identity and we live this truth in our everyday actions.
•
Acting with urgency - we set priorities; we empathize and most simply, we do the right thing.
•
Rolling up our sleeves, working together and doing what it takes to get the job done - we have a bias towards action vs. analysis; we’re not afraid of tough situations and when necessary, we grind it out.
•
Welcoming different perspectives - we bring together the best of our diverse experiences.
•
Having the courage to tell the truth and act in a non-political way - we have the mettle to confront issues directly.
Employee Experience Before, During and Beyond COVID-19 Pandemic
Why people work for Proofpoint:
•
Rewards and Recognition
•
Growth and Development
•
Compelling Future
•
Positive Work Environment
As Proofpoint has grown, so have our programs continued to evolve to meet our colleagues’ needs, which we believe is essential to attract and retain employees of the highest caliber. We regularly and frequently communicate with and listen to our employees through small group surveys, interactive forums and townhalls, emails and online resources, to then iterate our processes and programs to improve the employee experience. For example, at our weekly townhall meetings, our CEO and other members of the executive team engage our global workforce with updates on the COVID-19 pandemic, our ongoing business operations, and other topics of interest.
Over the past year the employee experience has changed. They have encountered, observed and felt a transition from our traditional programs to virtual offerings that employees and their families can participate in, balancing a mix of live and on-demand activity. These online programs include educational classes taught by our fellow colleagues, mental health courses (mindfulness, resilience, meditation), cooking classes, financial well-being support, and “Vacation at Home” ideas. We realized that many of our parents sometimes need a little additional support, and because of this, Proofpoint created programming for Proofpoint kids, which included week-long STEAM camps during the summer, and offered ongoing story time, trivia games, art and dance, writing and oral presentation classes.
We launched in the summer of 2020, ProofpointEDU, a series of classes for Proofpoint kids taught by Proofpoint employees including topics like math, science, history, and cybersecurity for kids ages 5-15. Further, we introduced virtual team building programs such as trivia, bingo, escape rooms, and other group activities, all done via Zoom. Our Mindfulness program included music concerts, meditation, and resilience training.
In recognition of what we created for our employees, in July 2020, Proofpoint won the Espresa Innovation and Excellence Award for Culture Benefits.
Health, Safety and Wellness
The physical health, financial well-being, life balance and mental health of our employees is vital to the Company’s success. Throughout the year, we encourage healthy behaviors through regular communications, educational sessions, voluntary progress tracking, wellness challenges, and other incentives. Creating a culture where all colleagues feel supported and valued is paramount to our corporate mission.
The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has led to unique challenges and through it all, the health, safety, and the general well-being of our employees has remained our primary objective.
Inclusion and Diversity
We embrace and foster the diversity of our team members, customers, stakeholders and consumers. Everyone is valued and appreciated for their unique backgrounds, experiences, thoughts and talents, all of which contributes to the growth and sustainability of our business. We strive to cultivate a culture and vision that supports and enhances the Company’s ability to recruit, develop and retain diverse talent at every level. As a global and distributed workforce, we recognize and celebrate our team members, their varied
backgrounds and cultures. Our career development opportunities are designed to foster inclusivity through ongoing career conversations that actively advance and develop people of all backgrounds.
We believe that diversity, inclusion, and opportunity is a journey and we are committed to building a diverse and inclusive company and society for our employees, customers, partners, and shareholders. In order to create a more diverse and inclusive work environment, we provide education, training and tools so that all employees can become aware of bias, how it exists and how to mitigate it. As we continue to shape our work environment and world-class organization to be more inclusive and inviting, we are actively striving to build an extensive pipeline of talent through various programs. Our internal programs enable and empower our hiring managers to identify alternative and emerging talent pools and to create an inclusive candidate experience.
Talent Development
Our talent strategy focuses on attracting the best talent, recognizing and rewarding their performance, while continually developing, engaging and retaining such talent. Our goal is to be the employer of choice within our market and peer groups. We strive to grow and develop the different capabilities and skills that we need for our future growth and strategy, while maintaining a robust pipeline of talent throughout the organization. We employ the best in the industry to solve complex security challenges and we ensure their continued advancement and learning through internal and external development opportunities, such as provided by our own security awareness training platform and industry wide certification programs such as CISSP and CEH (“Certified Ethical Hacker”).
In addition, personal development opportunities are available to all employees through our learning programs, whose offerings include crucial conversations, time-management, and delegation. Our leadership development program, Elevate, is focused on building better leaders through personal growth, as well as building skills and tools for the modern leader. This investment in our human capital ensures we are building a resilient and skilled workforce through career development and opportunities.
Business Ethics
The Company is fully dedicated to conducting ourselves by the letter and in the spirit of the many laws and standards that apply to our business. Acting with honesty and integrity is a core cultural tenet at Proofpoint and we believe that conducting our business legally and ethically is foundational to our identity. The Company regularly re-enforces our commitment to ethics and integrity in employee communications from the CEO and other executive leaders, in our everyday actions and in processes and controls. As a part of our on-going efforts to ensure our employees conduct business with the highest levels of ethics and integrity, the Company mandates annual compliance training programs, provided in multiple languages for our global workforce. The Company encourages individuals to help it identify and raise ethical issues and concerns free of retaliation and to that end provides multiple means for individuals to report to the Board, management, the Company’s chief compliance officer, or to legal or human resources personnel. In cases where any individual would feel more comfortable making a report anonymously, this is enabled via an online and telephonic ethics related hotline service.

RISK FACTORS
Investing in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the following risk factors, as well as the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including our consolidated financial statements and the related notes and ""Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations"" before deciding whether to invest in shares of our common stock. The occurrence of any of the events or developments described below, or of additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial, could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows, financial condition and growth prospects. In such an event, the market price of our common stock could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment.
Risk Factors Summary
Our business is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those risks discussed at length below. These risks include, among others, the following:
•
We have a history of losses, and we are unable to predict the extent of any future losses or when, if ever, we will achieve profitability in the future.
•
We are unable to accurately predict the full extent to which the global COVID-19 pandemic may impact our business operations, financial performance, results of operations and stock price.
•
Weakened global economic conditions may adversely affect our industry, business and financial results.
•
Our quarterly operating results and other metrics are likely to vary significantly and be unpredictable, which could cause the trading price of our stock to decline.
•
Our customers may fail to pay us in accordance with the terms of their agreements, necessitating action by us to compel payment.
•
If we are unable to maintain high subscription renewal rates, our future revenue and operating results will be harmed.
•
If we are unable to sell additional solutions to our customers, our future revenue and operating results will be harmed.
•
If our solutions fail or are perceived to fail to protect our customers from security breaches, our brand and reputation could be harmed, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
•
If our customers experience data losses and breaches via our products or solutions, our brand, reputation and business could be harmed.
•
Defects or vulnerabilities in our solutions could harm our reputation, reduce the sales of our solutions and expose us to liability for losses.
•
Our software, website, hosted and internal systems may be subject to intentional disruption or penetration from external attackers or insiders that could adversely impact our reputation and future sales.
•
Our solutions may collect, filter and store customer data which may contain personal information, which raises privacy concerns and could result in us having liability or inhibit sales of our solutions.
•
We operate in a highly competitive environment with large, established competitors, and our competitors may gain market share in the markets for our solutions that could adversely affect our business and cause our revenue to decline.
•
If we do not effectively expand and train our sales force, we may be unable to add new customers or increase sales to our existing customers and our business will be harmed.
•
Our sales cycle is long and unpredictable, and our sales efforts require considerable time and expense. As a result, our results are difficult to predict and may vary substantially from quarter to quarter, which may cause our operating results to fluctuate.
•
Because our long-term success depends, in part, on our ability to expand the sales of our platform to our customers located outside of the United States, our business will be increasingly susceptible to risks associated with international operations.
•
Conversion of our 2024 Notes may affect the price of our common stock and the value of the 2024 Notes.
•
Servicing our debt will require a significant amount of cash. We may not have sufficient cash flow from our business to pay our substantial debt, and we may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to settle conversions of the 2024 Notes in cash or to repurchase the 2024 Notes upon a fundamental change, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations.
•
Share repurchases under our Repurchase Program could increase the volatility of the trading price of our common stock, could diminish our cash reserves, could occur at non-optimal prices and may not result in the most effective use of our capital.
Risks Related to Our Business and Industry
We have a history of losses, and we are unable to predict the extent of any future losses or when, if ever, we will achieve profitability in the future.
We have incurred net losses in every year since our inception, including net losses of $163.8 million, $130.3 million and $103.7 million in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. As a result, we had an accumulated deficit of $889.4 million as of December 31, 2020. Achieving profitability will require us to increase revenue, manage our cost structure, and avoid unanticipated liabilities. We do not expect to be profitable in the near term. Revenue growth may slow, or revenue may decline for a number of possible reasons, including slowing demand for our solutions, increasing competition, a decrease in the growth of our overall market, or if we fail for any reason to continue to capitalize on growth opportunities. Any failure by us to obtain and sustain profitability, or to continue our revenue growth, could cause the price of our common stock to decline significantly.
We are unable to accurately predict the full extent to which the global COVID-19 pandemic may impact our business operations, financial performance, results of operations and stock price.
The COVID-19 pandemic continues to present extraordinary challenges in predicting future performance, and while we have modeled many scenarios and associated outcomes, there may be events that are more dire than we have modeled given the unique nature of this event. Although we are closely monitoring the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and continually assess its potential effects on our business, our actual results could vary widely from our models. The extent to which our projections are affected by COVID-19 will largely depend on future developments, including the duration and spread of the outbreak, which still cannot be accurately predicted and remain uncertain. The COVID-19 pandemic or the perception of its effects could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.
Weakened global economic conditions may adversely affect our industry, business and financial results.
Our business depends on the overall demand for information technology and on the economic health of our current and prospective customers. Challenging economic conditions worldwide have from time to time contributed, and may continue to contribute, to slowdowns in the information technology industry, resulting in reduced demand for our solutions as a result of continued constraints on IT-related capital spending by our customers and increased price competition for our solutions. Further, any significant weakening of the economy in the United States or Europe and of the global economy, more limited availability of credit, a reduction in business confidence and activity, economic uncertainty and other difficulties, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, may affect one or more of the sectors or countries in which we sell our services. In addition, geopolitical developments, such as existing and potential trade wars and other events beyond our control, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, can increase levels of political and economic unpredictability globally and increase the volatility of global financial markets.
For example, current or potential customers have delayed and decreased and may continue to delay or decrease spending with us, or may not pay us or may delay paying us for previously performed services, given the impact that the COVID-19 pandemic has had and may continue to have on their business. Furthermore, the rate of customer terminations or service cancellations or failures to renew, which we refer to as churn, has and could also further increase as a result of the effects of the pandemic, which could include increased price competition or a reduction in customer spending. Due to restrictions on travel and in-person meetings, current or potential customers may also not be interested in taking sales meetings or cancel existing sales meetings with our sales representatives, which could materially lengthen our sales cycle and slow our sales growth. Any of these events could have an adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial position.
Our quarterly operating results and other metrics are likely to vary significantly and be unpredictable, which could cause the trading price of our stock to decline.
Our operating results and other metrics have historically varied from period to period, and we expect that they will continue to do so as a result of a number of factors, many of which are outside of our control and may be difficult to predict, including:
•
the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic;
•
the level of demand for our solutions, including our newly-introduced solutions, and the level of perceived urgency regarding security threats and compliance requirements;
•
the timing of new subscriptions and renewals of existing subscriptions;
•
the mix of solutions sold;
•
the extent to which customers subscribe for additional solutions or increase the number of users;
•
customer budgeting cycles and seasonal buying patterns;
•
the extent to which we bring on new distributors;
•
any changes in the competitive landscape of our industry, including consolidation among our competitors, customers, partners or resellers;
•
timing of costs and expenses during a quarter;
•
deferral of orders in anticipation of new solutions or enhancements announced by us;
•
price competition;
•
changes in renewal rates and terms in any quarter;
•
the impact of acquisitions;
•
litigation costs;
•
any disruption in our sales channels or termination of our relationship with strategic channel partners;
•
general economic conditions, both domestically and in our foreign markets, and related changes to currency exchange rates;
•
insolvency or credit difficulties confronting our customers, affecting their ability to purchase or pay for our solutions; or
•
future accounting pronouncements or changes in our accounting policies.
Any one of the factors above or the cumulative effect of some of the factors referred to above may result in significant fluctuations in our financial and other operating results, including fluctuations in our key metrics. This variability and unpredictability could result in our failing to meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors for any period. If we fail to meet or exceed such expectations for these or any other reasons, the market price of our shares could fall substantially and we could face costly lawsuits, including securities class action suits. In addition, a significant percentage of our operating expenses are fixed in nature and based on forecasted revenue and cash flow trends. Accordingly, in the event of revenue shortfalls, we are generally unable to mitigate the negative impact on margins or other operating results in the short term.
We may fail to meet or exceed the expectations of securities analysts and investors, and the market price for our common stock could decline. If one or more of the securities analysts who cover us change their recommendation regarding our stock adversely, the market price for our common stock could decline. Additionally, our stock price may be based on expectations, estimates or forecasts of our future performance that may be unrealistic or may not be achieved. Further, our stock price may be affected by financial media, including press reports and blogs.
Our customers may fail to pay us in accordance with the terms of their agreements, necessitating action by us to compel payment.
If customers fail to pay us under the terms of our agreements, we may be adversely affected both from the inability to collect amounts due and the cost of enforcing the terms of our contracts, including through litigation. The risk of such negative effects increases with the term length of our customer arrangements. Furthermore, some of our customers have attempted to and may continue to attempt to renegotiate contracts, seek bankruptcy protection or other similar relief and fail to pay amounts due to us, or pay those amounts more slowly, either of which could adversely affect our operating results, financial position and cash flow. The recent and ongoing global COVID-19 pandemic may also increase the likelihood, frequency and magnitude of these risks.
If we are unable to maintain high subscription renewal rates, our future revenue and operating results will be harmed.
Our customers have no obligation to renew their subscriptions for our solutions after the expiration of their initial subscription period, which typically ranges from one to three years. In addition, our customers may renew for fewer subscription services or users, renew for shorter contract lengths or renew at lower prices due to competitive or other pressures. We cannot accurately predict renewal rates and our renewal rates may decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including competition, customers’ IT budgeting and spending priorities, and deteriorating general economic conditions, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. If our customers do not renew their subscriptions for our solutions, our revenue would decline and our business would suffer.
If we are unable to sell additional solutions to our customers, our future revenue and operating results will be harmed.
Our future success depends on our ability to sell additional solutions to our customers. This may require increasingly sophisticated and costly sales efforts and may not result in additional sales. In addition, the rate at which our customers purchase additional solutions depends on a number of factors, including the perceived need for additional solutions, growth in the number of end users, and general economic conditions. If our efforts to sell additional solutions to our customers are not successful, our business may suffer.
If our solutions fail or are perceived to fail to protect our customers from security breaches, our brand and reputation could be harmed, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
The threats facing our customers are constantly evolving and the techniques used by attackers to access or sabotage data change frequently. As a result, we must constantly update our solutions to respond to these threats. If we fail to update our solutions in a timely or effective manner to respond to these threats, our customers could experience security breaches. Increasingly, companies are subject to a wide variety of attacks on their networks and systems, including traditional computer hackers, malicious code (such as viruses and worms), distributed denial-of-service attacks, sophisticated attacks conducted or sponsored by nation-states, advanced persistent threat intrusions, ransomware, and theft or misuse of intellectual property or business or personal data, including by disgruntled employees, former employees or contractors. Many federal, state and foreign governments have enacted laws requiring companies to notify individuals of data security breaches involving their personal data. These mandatory disclosures regarding a security breach often lead to widespread negative publicity, and any association of us with such publicity may cause our customers to lose confidence in the effectiveness of our data security measures. Any security breach at one of our customers or even an unproven allegation of a security breach at one of our customers, could harm our reputation as a secure and trusted company and could cause the loss of customers and sales, loss of competitive advantages over our competitors, increased costs to remedy any problems and otherwise respond to any incident, regulatory investigations and enforcement actions, costly litigation, and other liability. In addition, we may incur significant costs and operational consequences of investigating, remediating, eliminating and putting in place additional tools and devices designed to prevent actual or perceived security breaches and other security incidents, as well as the costs to comply with any notification obligations resulting from any security incidents. Similarly, if a well-publicized breach of data security at a customer of any other cloud-based data protection or archiving service provider or other major enterprise cloud services provider were to occur, there could be a loss of confidence in the cloud-based protection and storage of sensitive data and information generally.
In addition, our solutions work in conjunction with a variety of other elements in customers’ IT and security infrastructure, and we may receive blame and negative publicity for a security breach that may have been the result of the failure of one of the other elements not provided by us. The occurrence of a breach, whether or not caused by our solutions, or allegations of a breach, even if such allegations turn out to be untrue, could delay or reduce market acceptance of our solutions and have an adverse effect on our business and financial performance. In addition, any revisions to our solutions that we believe may be necessary or appropriate in connection with any such breach may cause us to incur significant expenses. We cannot assure you that any of our efforts to manage this risk, including adoption of a comprehensive incident response plan and process for detecting, mitigating, and investigating security incidents that we test through table-top exercises, testing of our security protocols through additional techniques, such as penetration testing, debriefing after security incidents, to improve our security and responses, and regular briefing of our directors and officers on our cybersecurity risks, preparedness, and management, will be effective in protecting us from such attacks. Any of these events could have material adverse effects on our brand and reputation, which could harm our business, financial condition, and operating results.
If our customers experience data losses and breaches via our products or solutions, our brand, reputation and business could be harmed.
Our customers rely on our archiving and other solutions to protect, transfer or store their corporate data, which may include financial records, credit card information, business information, health information, other personally identifiable information or other sensitive personal information. A breach of our network security and systems or other events that cause the loss or public disclosure of, or access by third parties to, our customers’ stored files or data could have serious negative consequences for our business, including possible fines, penalties and damages, reduced demand for our solutions, an unwillingness of our customers to use our solutions, harm to our brand and reputation, and time-consuming and expensive litigation. The techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently, often are not recognized until launched against a target, and may originate from less regulated or remote areas around the world. As a result, we may be unable to proactively prevent these techniques, implement adequate preventative or reactionary measures, or enforce the laws and regulations that govern such activities. In addition, because of the large amount of data that we collect and manage, it is possible that hardware failures, insider errors or malfeasance or errors in our systems could result in data loss or corruption, or cause the information that we collect to be incomplete or contain inaccuracies that our customers regard as significant. If our customers experience any data loss, or any data corruption or inaccuracies, whether caused by security breaches or otherwise, our brand, reputation and business would be harmed.
Our insurance may be inadequate or may not be available in the future on acceptable terms, or at all. In addition, our policy may not cover any claim against us for loss of data or other indirect or consequential damages. Defending a suit based on any data loss or system disruption, regardless of its merit, could be costly and divert management’s attention.
Defects or vulnerabilities in our solutions could harm our reputation, reduce the sales of our solutions and expose us to liability for losses.
Because our solutions are complex, undetected errors, failures or bugs may occur, especially when solutions are first introduced or when new versions or updates are released, or when we introduce an acquired company’s products of services, despite our efforts to test those solutions and enhancements prior to release. This includes not only vulnerabilities that are specific to our solutions, but also vulnerabilities that impact the third-party or open source software or services that we use or the hardware that we rely on for our solutions. Additionally, we may be impacted by the evaluation of the security of our services by third party security scoring companies whether those evaluations are accurate or not. We may not be able to correct defects, errors, vulnerabilities or failures promptly, or to correct inaccuracies in perceptions about these matters at all.
Any defects, errors, vulnerabilities or failures in our solutions could result in:
•
expenditure of significant financial and development resources in efforts to analyze, correct, eliminate or work around errors or defects or to address and eliminate vulnerabilities;
•
loss of existing or potential partners or customers or loss of customer confidence;
•
loss or disclosure of our customers’ confidential information, or the inability to access such information;
•
loss of our proprietary technology;
•
our solutions being susceptible to hacking or electronic break-ins or otherwise failing to secure data;
•
delayed or lost revenue;
•
delay or failure to attain market acceptance;
•
lost market share;
•
negative publicity, which could harm our reputation; or
•
litigation, regulatory inquiries or investigations that would be costly and harm our reputation.
Limitation of liability provisions in our standard terms and conditions and our other agreements may not adequately or effectively protect us from any claims related to defects, errors, vulnerabilities or failures in our solutions, including as a result of federal, state or local laws or ordinances or unfavorable judicial decisions in the United States or other countries.
Our software, website, hosted and internal systems may be subject to intentional disruption or penetration from external attackers or insiders that could adversely impact our reputation and future sales.
We could be a target of attacks specifically designed to impede the performance of our solutions, redirect users to malicious sites, harm our reputation and brand, or misappropriate our or our customers’ proprietary information. Similarly, experienced computer hackers may attempt to penetrate our network or other security or the security of our website or other hosted or internal systems or to trick our employees into taking actions that compromise our security (such as via phishing or business email compromise attacks) in order to misappropriate proprietary information and/or cause interruptions of our services and/or expose perceived security vulnerabilities. It is also possible that systems may be disrupted or our sensitive information or the information of our customers might be exposed due to malfeasance or errors by employees or contractors. Because the techniques used by attackers to access or sabotage networks and compromise our systems and information change frequently and may not be recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques. If an actual or perceived breach of network security occurs as a result of third-party action, including cyber-attacks or other intentional misconduct by computer hackers conducted or sponsored by nation-states, error or malfeasance by insiders, or otherwise, it could adversely affect the market perception of our company and our solutions, may expose us to the loss of information, litigation and possible liability, and could cause a loss in revenue due to reputational or brand damage and customer churn. In addition, such a security breach could impair our ability to operate our business, including our ability to provide support services to our customers.
Our solutions may collect, filter and store customer data which may contain personal information, which raises privacy concerns and could result in us having liability or inhibit sales of our solutions.
Many federal, state and foreign government bodies and agencies have adopted or are considering adopting laws and regulations regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information. Because many of the features of our solutions use, store, and report on customer data which may contain personal information from our customers, any inability to adequately address
privacy concerns, or comply with applicable privacy laws, regulations and policies could, even if unfounded, result in liability to us, damage to our reputation, loss of sales, and harm to our business. Furthermore, the costs of compliance with, and other burdens imposed by, such laws, regulations and policies that are applicable to the businesses of our customers may limit the use and adoption of our solutions and reduce overall demand for them. Privacy concerns, whether or not valid, may inhibit market adoption of our solutions. For example, in the United States regulations such as the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, which protects and restricts the use of consumer credit and financial information, and HIPAA which regulates the use and disclosure of personal health information, impose significant security and data protection requirements and obligations on businesses that may affect the use and adoption of our solutions. Similarly, we hold a FedRAMP authorization without which we would not be able to provide services and products to certain US federal entities.
In the past we have relied on U.S.-European Union Frameworks for transatlantic data flows such as the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield, for which we self-certified under the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield framework on October 5, 2016. However, Privacy Shield is currently being challenged in European Union (“EU”) courts, and on July 16, 2020, the Court of Justice of the EU issued a decision invalidating outright the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield framework, so there is some uncertainty regarding its future validity and our ability to rely on it for EU to US data transfers. We also rely on Standard Contractual Clauses (“SCCs”) authorized by the EU’s Data Protection Directive of 1995 for transatlantic data flows, but the SCCs are also being challenged in EU courts, so there is some uncertainty regarding our ability to rely on SCCs in the future for EU to US data transfer. Additionally, the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation, began to be enforced on May 25, 2018, and carries with it significantly increased responsibilities and potential penalties for companies that process EU personal data. We have seen increased customer attention surrounding EU Data Privacy. Furthermore, outside of the EU, we continue to see increased regulation of data privacy and security, including the adoption of more stringent subject matter specific state laws (such as the New York Department of Financial Services’ Cybersecurity Regulation, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 that became effective January 1, 2020, and the new California Privacy Rights Act), national laws regulating the collection and use of data, and security and data breach obligations. The uncertainty and changes in the requirements of multiple jurisdictions may increase the cost of compliance, delay or reduce demand for our services, restrict our ability to offer services in certain locations, impact our customers’ ability to deploy our solutions in certain jurisdictions, or subject us to sanctions, by national data protection regulators, all of which could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.
The regulatory framework for privacy issues is evolving worldwide, and various government and consumer agencies and public advocacy groups have called for new regulation and changes in industry practices. It is possible that new laws and regulations will be adopted in the United States and internationally, or existing laws and regulations may be interpreted in new ways, that would affect our business. Complying with any new regulatory requirements could force us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner that could reduce our revenue or compromise our ability to effectively pursue our growth strategy.
Any failure or perceived failure to comply with laws and regulations or loss of certifications such as the FedRAMP authorization may result in proceedings or actions against us by government entities or others, or could cause us to lose users and customers, which could potentially have an adverse effect on our business.
We operate in a highly competitive environment with large, established competitors, and our competitors may gain market share in the markets for our solutions that could adversely affect our business and cause our revenue to decline.
Our traditional competitors include security-focused software vendors, such as Broadcom Inc. and Cisco Systems, Inc., which offer software products that directly compete with our solutions. In addition to competing with these vendors directly for sales to customers, we compete with them for the opportunity to have our solutions bundled with the product offerings of our strategic partners. Our competitors could gain market share from us if any of these partners replace our solutions with the products of our competitors or if these partners more actively promote our competitors’ products over our solutions. In addition, software vendors who have bundled our solutions with theirs may choose to bundle their software with their own or other vendors’ software, or may limit our access to standard product interfaces and inhibit our ability to develop solutions for their platform.
We also face competition from large technology companies, such as Broadcom Inc., Cisco Systems, Inc., Google Inc., Micro Focus International plc and Microsoft Corporation. These companies are increasingly developing and incorporating into their products features that compete on various levels with our solutions. Our competitive position could be adversely affected to the extent that our customers perceive that the functionality incorporated into these products would replace the need for our solutions or that buying from one vendor would provide them with increased leverage and purchasing power and a better customer experience. We also face competition from independent security vendors such as FireEye, Inc. that offer network security products and many smaller companies like Mimecast Ltd that specialize in particular segments of the markets in which we compete.
Many of our competitors have greater financial, technical, sales, marketing or other resources than we do and consequently may have the ability to influence our customers to purchase their products instead of ours. Further consolidation within our industry or other changes in the competitive environment could also result in larger competitors that compete with us on several levels. In addition, acquisitions of smaller companies by large technology companies that specialize in particular segments of the markets in which we compete would result in increased competition from these large technology companies. If we are unsuccessful in responding to our competitors or to changing technological and customer demands, our competitive position and financial results could be adversely affected.
If we do not effectively expand and train our sales force, we may be unable to add new customers or increase sales to our existing customers and our business will be harmed.
We continue to be substantially dependent on our sales force to obtain new customers and to sell additional solutions to our existing customers. We believe that there is significant competition for sales personnel with the skills and technical knowledge that we require. Our ability to achieve significant revenue growth will depend, in large part, on our success in recruiting, training and retaining sufficient numbers of sales personnel. New hires require significant training and may take significant time before they achieve full productivity, a period which may be prolonged due to the remote working arrangements we have adopted due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Our recent hires and planned hires may not become as productive as we expect, and we may be unable to hire or retain sufficient numbers of qualified individuals in the markets where we do business or plan to do business. If we are unable to hire and train sufficient numbers of effective sales personnel, or the sales personnel are not successful in obtaining new customers or increasing sales to our existing customer base, our business will be harmed.
Our sales cycle is long and unpredictable, and our sales efforts require considerable time and expense. As a result, our results are difficult to predict and may vary substantially from quarter to quarter, which may cause our operating results to fluctuate.
We sell our security and compliance offerings primarily to enterprise IT departments that are managing a growing set of user and compliance demands, which has increased the complexity of customer requirements to be met and confirmed in the sales cycle. Increasingly, we have found that security, legal and compliance departments are involved in testing, evaluating and finally approving purchases, which has also made the sales cycle longer and less predictable. We may not be able to accurately predict or forecast the timing of sales, which makes our future revenue difficult to predict and could cause our results to vary significantly. In addition, we might devote substantial time and effort to a particular unsuccessful sales effort, and as a result we could lose other sales opportunities or incur expenses that are not offset by an increase in revenue, which could harm our business.
Because our long-term success depends, in part, on our ability to expand the sales of our platform to our customers located outside of the United States, our business will be increasingly susceptible to risks associated with international operations.
One key element of our growth strategy is to develop a worldwide customer base and expand our operations worldwide, such as by adding employees, offices and customers internationally, particularly in Europe and Asia.
Operating in international markets requires significant resources and management attention and will subject us to regulatory, economic, political and competitive risks and competition that are different from those in the United States.
In addition, our international operations may fail to succeed due to other risks inherent in operating businesses internationally, including:
•
fluctuations in currency exchange rates, including as a result of volatile market conditions arising from the COVID-19 pandemic, which may cause our revenues and operating results to differ materially from expectations;
•
our lack of familiarity with commercial and social norms and customs in other countries which may adversely affect our ability to recruit, retain and manage employees in these countries;
•
difficulties and costs associated with staffing and managing foreign operations;
•
the potential diversion of management’s attention to oversee and direct operations that are geographically distant from our U.S. headquarters;
•
compliance with multiple, conflicting and changing governmental laws and regulations, including employment, tax, privacy and data protection laws and regulations;
•
legal systems in which our ability to enforce and protect our rights may be different or less effective than in the United States, including more limited protection for intellectual property rights in some countries;
•
immaturity of compliance regulations in other jurisdictions, which may lower demand for our solutions;
•
greater difficulty with payment collections and longer payment cycles;
•
higher employee costs and difficulty terminating non-performing employees;
•
differences in workplace cultures;
•
the need to adapt our solutions for specific countries;
•
our ability to comply with differing technical and certification requirements outside the United States;
•
tariffs, export controls and other non-tariff barriers such as quotas and local content rules;
•
uncertainties related to the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the European Union (“Brexit”) and its impact on our customers, data protection regulations and our employees and their ability to emigrate and travel to and from the United Kingdom;
•
adverse tax consequences;
•
restrictions on the transfer of funds;
•
anti-bribery compliance by us or our partners, including under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar laws of other jurisdictions; and
•
new and different sources of competition.
In addition, the prior U.S. administration has instituted or proposed changes to foreign trade policy including the negotiation or termination of trade agreements, the imposition of tariffs on products imported from certain countries, economic sanctions on individuals, corporations or countries and other government regulations affecting trade between the United States and other countries in which we do business. As a result, certain foreign governments have instituted or are considering imposing trade sanctions on certain U.S. manufactured goods. The escalation of protectionist or retaliatory trade measures in either the United States or any other countries in which we do business, such as a change in tariff structures, export compliance or other trade policies, may increase the cost of, or otherwise interfere with, conducting our business.
Our failure to manage any of these risks successfully could harm our existing and future international operations and seriously impair our overall business.
If we are unable to enhance our existing solutions and develop new solutions, our growth will be harmed, and we may not be able to achieve profitability.
Our ability to attract new customers and increase revenue from existing customers will depend in large part on our ability to enhance and improve our existing solutions and to introduce new solutions. The success of any enhancement or new solution depends on several factors, including the timely completion, introduction and market acceptance of the enhancement or solution. Any new enhancement or solution we develop or acquire may not be introduced in a timely or cost-effective manner and may not achieve the broad market acceptance necessary to generate significant revenue. If we are unable to successfully develop or acquire new solutions or enhance our existing solutions to meet customer requirements, we may not grow as expected and we may not achieve profitability.
We cannot be certain that our development activities will be successful or that we will not incur delays or cost overruns. Furthermore, we may not have sufficient financial resources to identify and develop new technologies and bring enhancements or new solutions to market in a timely and cost-effective manner. New technologies and enhancements could be delayed or cost more than we expect, and we cannot ensure that any of these solutions will be commercially successful if and when they are introduced.
If we are unable to cost-effectively scale or adapt our existing architecture to accommodate increased traffic, technological advances or changing customer requirements, our operating results could be harmed.
As our customer base grows, the number of users accessing our solutions over the Internet will correspondingly increase. Increased traffic could result in slow access speeds and response times. Since our customer agreements often include service availability commitments, slow speeds or our failure to accommodate increased traffic could result in breaches of our service level agreements or obligate us to issue service credits. In addition, the market for our solutions is characterized by rapid technological advances and changes in customer and regulatory requirements. In order to accommodate increased traffic and respond to technological advances and evolving customer and regulatory requirements, we expect that we will be required to make future investments in our network architecture. If we do not implement future upgrades to our network architecture cost-effectively, or if we experience prolonged delays or unforeseen difficulties in connection with upgrading our network architecture, our service quality may suffer, and our operating results could be harmed.
If we fail to manage our sales and distribution channels effectively or if our partners choose not to market and sell our solutions to their customers, our operating results could be adversely affected.
We have derived and anticipate that in the future we will continue to derive a substantial portion of the sales of our solutions through channel partners. In order to scale our channel program to support growth in our business, it is important that we continue to help our partners enhance their ability to independently sell and deploy our solutions. We may be unable to continue to successfully expand and improve the effectiveness of our channel sales program.
Our agreements with our channel partners are generally non-exclusive and some of our channel partners have entered, and may continue to enter, into strategic relationships with our competitors or are competitors themselves. Further, many of our channel partners have multiple strategic relationships and they may not regard us as significant for their businesses. Our channel partners may terminate their respective relationships with us with limited or no notice and with limited or no penalty, pursue other partnerships or
relationships, or attempt to develop or acquire products or services that compete with our solutions. Our partners also may impair our ability to enter into other desirable strategic relationships. If our channel partners do not effectively market and sell our solutions, if they choose to place greater emphasis on products of their own or those offered by our competitors, or if they fail to meet the needs of our customers, our ability to grow our business and sell our solutions may be adversely affected. Similarly, the loss of a substantial number of our channel partners, and our possible inability to replace them, the failure to recruit additional channel partners, any reduction or delay in their sales of our solutions, or any conflicts between channel sales and our direct sales and marketing activities could materially and adversely affect our results of operations.
Because we recognize revenue from subscriptions over the term of the relevant service period, decreases or increases in sales are not immediately reflected in full in our operating results.
We recognize revenue from subscriptions over the term of the relevant service period, which typically range from one to three years, with some up to five years. As a result, most of our quarterly revenue from subscriptions results from agreements entered into during previous quarters. Consequently, a shortfall in demand for our solutions in any quarter may not significantly reduce our subscription revenue for that quarter, but could negatively affect subscription revenue in future quarters. We may be unable to adjust our cost structure to compensate for this potential shortfall in subscription revenue. Accordingly, the effect of significant downturns in sales of subscriptions may not be fully reflected in our results of operations until future periods. Our subscription model also makes it difficult for us to rapidly increase our subscription revenue through additional sales in any period, as subscription revenue must be recognized over the term of the contract.
Any interruptions or delays in services provided through our internal operations or by third-parties, including data center hosting facilities, network service providers, cloud computing platform providers and other hardware and software vendors, or from our inability to adequately plan for and manage service interruptions or infrastructure capacity requirements, could impair the delivery of our services and harm our business.
Our business operations are subject to interruption by natural disasters, fire, power shortages, pandemics (including the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic) and other events beyond our control. We rely on a number of third-party providers for data center hosting facilities, equipment, maintenance and other services, and the loss of, or problems with, one or more of these providers or our internal operations and infrastructure, including any potential disruptions due to significantly increased global demand on certain cloud-based systems during the COVID-19 pandemic, may impact our ability to properly maintain and repair our systems, thereby causing us to lose customers.
We currently serve our customers from third-party data center facilities and resources located in the United States, Canada, Australia and Europe. We also rely on bandwidth providers, Internet service providers, mobile networks and other third-party IT service providers to operate our business and to deliver our solutions. Any damage to, or failure or disruption of, the systems of our third-party providers could result in interruptions to our service. If for any reason our arrangement with one or more of our data centers is terminated, we could experience additional expense in arranging for new facilities and support. Our data center facilities providers have no obligations to renew their agreements with us on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. If we are unable to renew our agreements with the facilities providers on commercially reasonable terms or if in the future, we add additional data center facility providers, we may experience costs or downtime in connection with the transfer to, or the addition of, new data center facilities. In addition, the failure of our data centers to meet our capacity requirements could result in interruptions in the availability of our solutions, impair the functionality of our solutions or impede our ability to scale our operations. As we continue to add data centers, restructure our data management plans, and increase capacity in existing and future data centers, we may move or transfer our data and our customers’ data. Despite precautions taken during such processes and procedures, any unsuccessful data transfers may impair the delivery of our service, and we may experience costs or downtime in connection with the transfer of data to other facilities. Similarly, some of our solutions’ features run or depend on IT services run by third parties, such as data feeds or public clouds, such as Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud, and an extended failure of such services might materially and adversely impact our ability to provide our services to our customers. Furthermore, some of our sales and business operations, such as CRM and billing and invoicing depend in part on third-party IT service providers and if those services were to be unavailable for extended periods of time it might materially and adversely affect our ability to operate.
We also depend on access to the Internet through third-party bandwidth providers to operate our business. If we lose the services of one or more of our bandwidth providers, or if these providers experience outages, for any reason, we could experience disruption in delivering our solutions or we could be required to retain the services of a replacement bandwidth provider. Our business also depends on our customers having high-speed access to the Internet. Any Internet outages or delays could adversely affect our ability to provide our solutions to our customers.
Our operations rely heavily on the availability of electricity, which also comes from third-party providers. If we or the third-party data center facilities that we use to deliver our services were to experience a major power outage or if the cost of electricity were to increase significantly, our operations and financial results could be harmed. If we or our third-party data centers were to experience a major power outage, we or they would have to rely on back-up generators, which might not work properly or might not provide an adequate power supply during a major power outage. Such a power outage could result in a significant disruption of our business.
For example, the COVID-19 pandemic and its adverse effects have become more prevalent in the locations where we conduct business and as a result, we have begun to experience more pronounced disruptions in our daily internal operations, including the closures of our physical domestic and international offices to promote the safety and security of our employees and to support the communities in which we operate. We have instituted remote working arrangements for employees where practicable, resulting in potential latent inefficiencies that may impact our operations.
Although we maintain crisis management and disaster response plans, including our business continuity plan, such events could make it difficult or impossible for us to deliver our services to our customers, could lead to lengthy interruptions in our service, and could decrease demand for our services. The occurrence of an extended interruption of our or third-party services for any reason could result in lengthy interruptions in our services or in the delivery of customers’ email and require us to provide service credits, refunds, indemnification payments or other payments to our customers, and could also result in the loss of customers. Additionally, any such system failures or outages could compromise our ability to conduct business or delay our financial reporting, which could materially affect our operating results and financial condition.
Any failure to offer or the inability of our customers to access our high-quality technical support services may adversely affect our relationships with our customers and harm our financial results.
Once our solutions are deployed, our customers depend on accessing our support organization to resolve any technical issues relating to our solutions, which may be impaired by interruptions caused by natural disasters, fire, power shortages, pandemics (including the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic) and other events beyond our control. In addition, our sales process is highly dependent on our solutions and business reputation and on strong recommendations from our existing customers. Any failure to maintain or the inability of our customers to access our high-quality technical support, or a market perception that we do not maintain high-quality support or the inability of our customers to access our high-quality support, could harm our reputation, adversely affect our ability to sell our solutions to existing and prospective customers, and harm our business, operating results and financial condition.
We offer technical support services with many of our solutions. We may be unable to respond quickly enough to accommodate short-term increases in customer demand for support services. We also may be unable to modify the format of our support services to compete with changes in support services provided by competitors. Increased customer demand for these services, without corresponding revenue, could increase costs and adversely affect our operating results.
We have outsourced a substantial portion of our worldwide customer support functions to third-party service providers. If these companies experience financial difficulties, do not maintain sufficiently skilled workers and resources to satisfy our contracts, or otherwise fail to perform at a sufficient level, the level of support services to our customers may be significantly disrupted, which could materially harm our reputation and our relationships with these customers.
If we fail to develop or protect our brand, our business may be harmed.
We believe that developing and maintaining awareness and integrity of our company and our brand are important to achieving widespread acceptance of our existing and future offerings and are important elements in attracting new customers. We believe that the importance of brand recognition will increase as competition in our market further intensifies. Successful promotion of our brand will depend on the effectiveness of our marketing efforts and on our ability to provide reliable and useful solutions at competitive prices. We plan to continue investing substantial resources to promote our brand, both domestically and internationally, but there is no guarantee that our brand development strategies will enhance the recognition of our brand. Some of our existing and potential competitors have well-established brands with greater recognition than we have. If our efforts to promote and maintain our brand are not successful, our operating results and our ability to attract and retain customers may be adversely affected. In addition, even if our brand recognition and loyalty increase, this may not result in increased use of our solutions or higher revenue.
In addition, independent industry analysts often provide reviews of our solutions, as well as those of our competitors, and perception of our solutions in the marketplace may be significantly influenced by these reviews. We have no control over what these industry analysts report, and because industry analysts may influence current and potential customers, our brand could be harmed if they do not provide a positive review of our solutions or view us as a market leader.
The steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property rights may not be adequate.
We rely on a combination of contractual rights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents and copyrights to establish and protect our intellectual property rights. These offer only limited protection, however, and the steps we have taken to protect our proprietary technology may not deter its misuse, theft or misappropriation. Any of our patents, copyrights, trademarks or other intellectual property rights may be challenged by others or invalidated through administrative process or litigation. Competitors may independently develop technologies or products that are substantially equivalent or superior to our solutions or that inappropriately incorporate our proprietary technology into their products. Competitors may hire our former employees who may misappropriate our proprietary technology or misuse our confidential information. Although we rely in part upon confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants and other third parties to protect our trade secrets and other confidential information, those agreements may not effectively prevent disclosure of trade secrets and other confidential information and may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of misappropriation of trade secrets or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. In addition, others may
independently discover our trade secrets and confidential information, and in such cases, we could not assert any trade secret rights against such parties.
We might be required to spend significant resources to monitor and protect our intellectual property rights. We may initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of our intellectual property rights or misappropriation of our trade secrets, or to establish the validity of our intellectual property rights. Any litigation, whether or not it is resolved in our favor, could result in significant expense to us and divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel, which may adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. Certain jurisdictions may not provide adequate legal infrastructure for effective protection of our intellectual property rights. Changing legal interpretations of liability for unauthorized use of our solutions or lessened sensitivity by corporate, government or institutional users to refraining from intellectual property piracy or other infringements of intellectual property could also harm our business.
Our issued patents may not provide us with any competitive advantages or may be challenged by third parties, and our patent applications may never be granted at all. It is possible that innovations for which we seek patent protection may not be protectable. Additionally, the process of obtaining patent protection is expensive and time consuming, and we may not be able to prosecute all necessary or desirable patent applications at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner. Given the cost, effort, risks and downside of obtaining patent protection, including the requirement to ultimately disclose the invention to the public, we may not choose to seek patent protection for certain innovations. However, such patent protection could later prove to be important to our business. Even if issued, there can be no assurance that any patents will have the coverage originally sought or adequately protect our intellectual property, as the legal standards relating to the validity, enforceability and scope of protection of patent and other intellectual property rights are uncertain. Any patents that are issued may be invalidated or otherwise limited, or may lapse or may be abandoned, enabling other companies to better develop products that compete with our solutions, which could adversely affect our competitive business position, business prospects and financial condition.
We cannot assure you that the measures we have taken to protect our intellectual property will adequately protect us, and any failure to protect our intellectual property could harm our business.
Third parties claiming that we infringe their intellectual property rights could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and prevent us from selling our solutions.
Companies and individuals in the software and technology industries, including some of our current and potential competitors, own large numbers of patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets and frequently enter into litigation based on allegations of infringement, misappropriation or other violations of intellectual property rights. In addition, many of these third parties have the capability to dedicate substantially greater resources to enforce their intellectual property rights and to defend claims that may be brought against them. The litigation may involve patent holding companies or other adverse patent owners who have no relevant product revenue and against whom our potential patents may provide little or no deterrence. We have received, and may in the future receive, notices that claim we have infringed, misappropriated or otherwise violated other parties’ intellectual property rights. We have been involved in litigation involving such allegations of infringement. To the extent we gain greater visibility, we could face a higher risk of being the subject of intellectual property infringement claims, which is not uncommon with respect to software technologies in general and information security technology in particular. There may be third-party intellectual property rights, including issued or pending patents that cover significant aspects of our technologies or business methods. Any intellectual property claims, with or without merit, could be very time consuming, could be expensive to settle or litigate and could divert our management’s attention and other resources. These claims could also subject us to significant liability for damages, potentially including treble damages if we are found to have willfully infringed patents or copyrights. These claims could also result in our having to stop using technology found to be in violation of a third-party’s rights. We might be required to seek a license for the intellectual property, which may not be available on reasonable terms or at all. Even if a license were available, we could be required to pay significant royalties, which would increase our operating expenses. As a result, we may be required to develop alternative non-infringing technology, which could require significant effort and expense. If we cannot license or develop technology for any infringing aspect of our business, we would be forced to limit or stop sales of one or more of our solutions or features of our solutions and may be unable to compete effectively. Any of these results would harm our business, operating results and financial condition.
In addition, our agreements with customers and channel partners include indemnification provisions under which we agree to indemnify them for losses suffered or incurred as a result of claims of intellectual property infringement and, in some cases, for damages caused by us to property or persons. Large indemnity payments could harm our business, operating results and financial condition.
We rely on technology and intellectual property licensed from other parties, the failure or loss of which could increase our costs and delay or prevent the delivery of our solutions.
We utilize various types of software and other technology, as well as intellectual property rights, licensed from unaffiliated third parties in order to provide certain elements of our solutions. Any errors or defects in any third-party technology could result in errors in our solutions that could harm our business. In addition, licensed technology and intellectual property rights may not continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. While we believe that there are currently adequate replacements for the
third-party technology we use, any loss of the right to use any of this technology on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, could result in delays in producing or delivering our solutions until equivalent technology is identified and integrated, which delays could harm our business. In this situation we would be required to either redesign our solutions to function with software available from other parties or to develop these components ourselves, which would result in increased costs. Furthermore, we might be forced to limit the features available in our current or future solutions. If we fail to maintain or renegotiate any of these technology or intellectual property licenses, we could face significant delays and diversion of resources in attempting to develop similar or replacement technology, or to license and integrate a functional equivalent of the technology.
Some of our solutions contain “open source” software, and any failure to comply with the terms of one or more of these open source licenses could negatively affect our business.
Some of our solutions are distributed with software licensed by its authors or other third parties under so-called “open source” licenses, which may include, by way of example, the GNU General Public License, or GPL, and the Apache License. Some of these licenses contain requirements that we make available source code for modifications or derivative works we create based upon the open source software, and that we license such modifications or derivative works under the terms of a particular open source license or other license granting third parties certain rights of further use. By the terms of certain open source licenses, we could be required to release the source code of our proprietary software, and to make our proprietary software available under open source licenses, if we combine our proprietary software with open source software in a certain manner. In the event that portions of our proprietary software are determined to be subject to an open source license, we could be required to publicly release the affected portions of our source code, re-engineer all or a portion of our technologies, or otherwise be limited in the licensing of our technologies, each of which could reduce or eliminate the value of our technologies and solutions. In addition to risks related to license requirements, usage of open source software can lead to greater risks than use of third-party commercial software, as open source licensors generally do not provide warranties or controls on the origin of the software. We have established processes to help alleviate these risks, including a review process for screening requests from our development organizations for the use of open source software, but we cannot be sure that all open source software is submitted for approval prior to use in our solutions, that our programmers have not incorporated open source software into our proprietary solutions and technologies or that they will not do so in the future. In addition, many of the risks associated with usage of open source software cannot be eliminated, and could, if not properly addressed, negatively affect our business.
Governmental regulations affecting the export of certain of our solutions could negatively affect our business.
Some of our products are subject to U.S. export controls, and we incorporate encryption technology into certain of our products. These encryption products and the underlying technology may be exported outside the United States only with the required export authorizations, including by license, a license exception or other appropriate government authorizations, including the filing of an encryption registration. Governmental regulation of encryption technology and regulation of imports or exports, or our failure to obtain required import or export approval for our products, could harm our international sales and adversely affect our revenue.
Failure to comply with such regulations, whether by us or companies that we have acquired, in the future could result in penalties, costs, and restrictions on export privileges, which could also harm our operating results.
We have, and may further, expand through acquisitions of, or investments in, other companies, which may divert our management’s attention, dilute our stockholders’ ownership interests and consume corporate resources that otherwise would be necessary to sustain and grow our business.
We have made multiple acquisitions in the past, and our business strategy may, from time to time, continue to include acquiring complementary products, technologies or businesses. We also may enter into relationships with other businesses in order to expand our solutions, which could involve preferred or exclusive licenses, additional channels of distribution, or investments by or between the two parties. Negotiating these transactions can be time consuming, difficult and expensive, and our ability to close these transactions may be subject to third-party approvals, such as government regulation, which are beyond our control. Consequently, we can make no assurance that these transactions, once undertaken and announced, will close.
These transactions may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures. In particular, we may encounter difficulties assimilating or integrating the businesses, technologies, products, personnel or operations of acquired companies, particularly if the key personnel of the acquired business choose not to work for us, and we may have difficulty retaining the customers of any acquired business. Acquisitions may also disrupt our ongoing business, divert our resources and require significant management attention that would otherwise be available for development of our business. Any acquisition or investment could expose us to unknown liabilities.
In addition, as of December 31, 2020, we had $818.8 million in goodwill and intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization, recorded on our balance sheet. We will incur expenses related to the amortization of intangible assets and we may in the future need to incur charges with respect to the impairment of goodwill or intangible assets, which could adversely affect our operating results. Moreover, we cannot assure you that the anticipated benefits of any acquisition or investment would be realized or that we would not be exposed to unknown liabilities. In connection with these types of transactions, we may issue additional equity securities that would dilute our stockholders’ ownership interests, use cash that we may need in the future to operate our business, incur debt on terms unfavorable to us or that we are unable to repay, incur large charges or substantial liabilities, encounter difficulties integrating diverse business cultures, and become subject to adverse tax consequences, substantial depreciation or deferred compensation charges. These challenges related to acquisitions or investments could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.
If we are unable to attract and retain qualified employees, lose key personnel, fail to integrate replacement personnel successfully, or fail to manage our employee base effectively, we may be unable to develop new and enhanced solutions, effectively manage or expand our business, or increase our revenue.
Our future success depends upon our ability to recruit and retain key management, technical, sales, marketing, finance, and other critical personnel. Competition for qualified management, technical and other personnel is intense, and we may not be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel. If we fail to attract and retain qualified employees, our ability to grow our business could be harmed. Our officers and other key personnel are employees-at-will, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to retain them. Competition for people with the specific skills that we require is significant. In order to attract and retain personnel in a competitive marketplace, we believe that we must provide a competitive compensation package, including cash and equity-based compensation. Volatility in our stock price may from time to time adversely affect our ability to recruit or retain employees. If we lose the services of our senior management or other key personnel, including due to illness resulting from COVID-19, if we are unable to hire and retain qualified employees, or conversely, if we fail to manage employee performance or reduce staffing levels when required by market conditions, our business and operating results could be adversely affected.
In addition, hiring, training, and successfully integrating replacement personnel could be time consuming, may cause additional disruptions to our operations, and may be unsuccessful, which could negatively impact future revenue.
Changes in laws and/or regulations related to the Internet or changes in the Internet infrastructure itself may diminish the demand for our solutions, and could have a negative impact on our business.
The future success of our business depends upon the continued use of the Internet as a primary medium for commerce, communication and business applications. Federal, state or foreign government bodies or agencies have in the past adopted, and may in the future adopt, laws or regulations affecting data privacy and the use of the Internet as a commercial medium. Changes in these laws or regulations could require us to modify our solutions in order to comply with these changes. In addition, government agencies or private organizations may begin to impose taxes, fees or other charges for accessing the Internet or commerce conducted via the Internet. These laws or charges could limit the growth of Internet-related commerce or communications generally, result in a decline in the use of the Internet and the viability of Internet-based applications such as ours and reduce the demand for our solutions.
The legal and regulatory framework also drives demand for our solutions. Our customers are subject to laws, regulations and internal policies that mandate how they process, handle, store, use and transmit a variety of sensitive data and communications. These laws and regulations are subject to revision, change and interpretation at any time, and any such change could either help or hurt the demand for our solutions. We cannot be sure that the legal and regulatory framework in any given jurisdiction will be favorable to our business or that we will be able to sustain or grow our business if there are any adverse changes to these laws and regulations.
A portion of our revenue is generated by sales to government entities, which are subject to a number of challenges and risks.
Sales to U.S. and foreign federal, state and local governmental agency customers have accounted for a portion of our revenue in past periods, and we may in the future increase sales to government entities. Sales into government entities are subject to a number of risks. Selling to government entities can be highly competitive, expensive and time consuming, often requiring significant upfront time and expense without any assurance that we will win a sale. We have invested in the creation of a cloud offering that has been certified under both the Federal Information Security Management Act and the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program for government usage but we cannot be sure that we will continue to sustain or renew this certification, that the government will continue to mandate such certification or that other government agencies or entities will use this cloud offering. Government demand and payment for our solutions may be impacted by public sector budgetary cycles and funding authorizations, with funding reductions or delays adversely affecting public sector demand for our solutions. Government entities may have contractual or other legal rights to terminate contracts with our distributors and resellers for convenience or due to a default, and any such termination may adversely impact our future results of operations. For example, if the distributor receives a significant portion of its revenue from sales to such governmental entity, the financial health of the distributor could be substantially harmed, which could negatively affect our future sales to such distributor. Governments routinely investigate and audit government contractors’ administrative processes, and any unfavorable audit could result in the government refusing to continue buying our solutions, a reduction of revenue or fines or civil or
criminal liability if the audit uncovers improper or illegal activities. Any such penalties could adversely impact our results of operations in a material way.
If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, our ability to produce timely and accurate financial statements or comply with applicable regulations could be impaired.
As a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the “Sarbanes-Oxley Act”), and the rules and regulations of the Nasdaq Global Select Market. We expect that the requirements of these rules and regulations will continue to increase our legal, accounting and financial compliance costs, make some activities more difficult, time consuming and costly, and place significant strain on our personnel, systems and resources.
The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. We are continuing to develop and refine our disclosure controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file with the SEC, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and that information required to be disclosed in reports under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our principal executive and financial officers.
Our current controls and any new controls that we develop may become inadequate because of changes in conditions in our business. In addition, because we have acquired companies in the past and may continue to do so in the future, we will also need to expend resources to integrate the controls of these acquired entities with ours. Further, weaknesses in our internal controls may be discovered in the future. Any failure to develop or maintain effective controls, or any difficulties encountered in their implementation or improvement, could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations and may result in a restatement of our financial statements for prior periods. Any failure to implement and maintain effective internal controls also could adversely affect the results of periodic management evaluations and annual independent registered public accounting firm report regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting that we are required to include in our Annual Report on Form 10-K under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Ineffective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial and other information, which would likely have a negative effect on the trading price of our common stock.
In order to maintain and improve the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, we have expended, and anticipate that we will continue to expend, significant resources, including accounting-related costs, and provide significant management oversight. Any failure to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls, or consequent inability to produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis, could increase our operating costs and could materially impair our ability to operate our business. In the event that we or our independent registered public accounting firm are not able to complete the work required under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act on a timely basis, or we are not able to demonstrate compliance with Section 404, we could be subject to late filings of our annual and quarterly reports, restatements of consolidated financial statements or other corrective disclosure, and, investors may lose confidence in our operating results and our stock price could decline. In addition, if we are unable to continue to meet these requirements, we may not be able to remain listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market.
We may not be able to utilize a significant portion of our net operating loss or research tax credit carryforwards, which could adversely affect our profitability.
As of December 31, 2020, we had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards due to prior period losses, some of which if not utilized will continue to expire in 2021 for federal and state purposes. We also have federal research tax credit carryforwards, which will continue to expire in 2021. These net operating loss and research tax credit carryforwards could expire unused and be unavailable to offset future income tax liabilities, which could adversely affect our profitability.
In addition, under Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, our ability to utilize net operating loss carryforwards or other tax attributes, such as research tax credits, in any taxable year may be limited if we experience an “ownership change.” An “ownership change” generally occurs if one or more stockholders or groups of stockholders who own at least 5% of our stock increase their ownership by more than 50 percentage points over their lowest ownership percentage within a rolling three-year period. Similar rules may apply under state tax laws.
Future issuances of our stock could cause an “ownership change.” It is possible that any future ownership change could have a material effect on the use of our net operating loss carryforwards or other tax attributes, which could adversely affect our profitability.
Risks Related to Our Convertible Senior Notes
We have indebtedness in the form of convertible senior notes.
In August 2019, we completed an offering of $920.0 million aggregate principal amount of 0.25% Convertible Senior Notes due 2024 (the “2024 Notes”). As a result of this convertible notes offering, we incurred $920.0 million principal amount of indebtedness, the principal amount of which we may be required to pay at maturity in 2024, upon an event of default (as defined in the indenture governing the 2024 Notes (the “indenture”)), or upon the occurrence of a make-whole fundamental change (as defined in the indenture). There can be no assurance that we will be able to repay this indebtedness when due, or that we will be able to refinance this indebtedness on acceptable terms or at all. In addition, this indebtedness could, among other things:
•
make it difficult for us to pay other obligations;
•
make it difficult to obtain favorable terms for any necessary future financing for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements or other purposes;
•
require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to service the indebtedness, reducing the amount of cash flow available for other purposes; and
•
limit our flexibility in planning for and reacting to changes in our business.
Conversion of our 2024 Notes may affect the price of our common stock and the value of the 2024 Notes.
The conversion of some or all of our 2024 Notes may dilute the ownership interest of existing stockholders to the extent we deliver shares of common stock upon conversion. Holders of the 2024 Notes will be able to convert them only upon the satisfaction of certain conditions prior to April 15, 2024. Upon conversion, holders of the 2024 Notes will receive cash, shares of common stock or a combination of cash and shares of common stock, at our election. Any sales in the public market of shares of common stock issued upon conversion of the 2024 Notes could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock and the value of the 2024 Notes.
Servicing our debt will require a significant amount of cash. We may not have sufficient cash flow from our business to pay our substantial debt, and we may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to settle conversions of the 2024 Notes in cash or to repurchase the 2024 Notes upon a fundamental change, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations.
Our ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of, to pay interest on, or to refinance our indebtedness, including the amounts payable under the 2024 Notes, depends on our future performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive, and other factors beyond our control. Our business may not continue to generate cash flow from operations in the future sufficient to service our indebtedness and make necessary capital expenditures. If we are unable to generate such cash flow, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as selling assets, restructuring debt, or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive. Our ability to refinance our indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. We may not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms, which could result in a default on our debt obligations.
Further, holders of the 2024 Notes have the right to require us to repurchase all or a portion of their 2024 Notes upon the occurrence of a “fundamental change” (as defined in the indenture) before the maturity date at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 2024 Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. In addition, upon conversion of the 2024 Notes, unless we elect to deliver solely shares of our common stock to settle such conversion (other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share), we will be required to make cash payments in respect of the 2024 Notes being converted. However, we may not have enough available cash or be able to obtain financing at the time we are required to make repurchases of 2024 Notes surrendered therefor, or pay cash with respect of 2024 Notes being converted.
The conditional conversion feature of the 2024 Notes, when triggered, may adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.
In the event the conditional conversion feature of the 2024 Notes is triggered, holders of the 2024 Notes will be entitled to convert their 2024 Notes at any time during specified periods at their option. If one or more holders elect to convert their 2024 Notes, unless we elect to satisfy our conversion obligation by delivering solely shares of our common stock (other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share), we would be required to settle a portion or all of our conversion obligation in cash, which could adversely affect our liquidity. In addition, even if holders of 2024 Notes do not elect to convert their 2024 Notes, we could be required under applicable accounting rules to reclassify all or a portion of the outstanding principal of the 2024 Notes as a current rather than long-term liability, which would result in a material reduction of our net working capital.
The accounting for convertible debt securities that may be settled in cash, such as the 2024 Notes, could have a material effect on our reported financial results.
Under Accounting Standards Codification 470-20, Debt with Conversion and Other Options (“ASC 470-20”), an entity must separately account for the liability and equity components of the convertible debt instruments (such as the 2024 Notes) that may be
settled entirely or partially in cash upon conversion in a manner that reflects the issuer’s economic interest cost. The effect of ASC 470-20 on the accounting for the 2024 Notes is that the equity component is required to be included in the additional paid-in capital section of stockholders’ equity on our consolidated balance sheet at the issuance date and the value of the equity component is treated as debt discount for purposes of accounting for the debt component of the 2024 Notes. As a result, we are required to record a greater amount of non-cash interest expense as a result of the amortization of the discounted carrying value of the 2024 Notes to their face amount over the term of the 2024 Notes. We report larger net losses (or lower net income) in our financial results because ASC 470-20 requires interest to include both the amortization of the debt discount and the instrument’s non-convertible coupon interest rate, which could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock and the trading price of the 2024 Notes.
The capped call transactions may affect the value of the 2024 Notes and our common stock.
In connection with the pricing of the 2024 Notes, we entered into capped call transactions with certain financial institutions. The capped call transactions are expected generally to reduce or offset the potential dilution upon conversion of the 2024 Notes and/or offset any cash payments we are required to make in excess of the principal amount of converted 2024 Notes, as the case may be, with such reduction and/or offset subject to a cap.
In connection with establishing their initial hedges of the capped call transactions, these financial institutions or their respective affiliates likely purchased shares of our common stock and/or entered into various derivative transactions with respect to our common stock concurrently with or shortly after the pricing of the 2024 Notes. These financial institutions or their respective affiliates may modify their hedge positions by entering into or unwinding various derivatives with respect to our common stock and/or purchasing or selling our common stock or other securities of ours in secondary market transactions following the pricing of the 2024 Notes and prior to the maturity of the 2024 Notes (and are likely to do so during any observation period related to a conversion of 2024 Notes). This activity could also cause or avoid an increase or a decrease in the market price of our common stock or the 2024 Notes.
The potential effect, if any, of these transactions and activities on the price of our common stock or the 2024 Notes will depend in part on market conditions and cannot be ascertained at this time. Any of these activities could adversely affect the value of our common stock.
We are subject to counterparty risk with respect to the capped call transactions.
The counterparties to the capped call transactions we entered into in connection with our 2024 Notes are financial institutions, and we will be subject to the risk that one or more of these counterparties may default or otherwise fail to perform, or may exercise certain rights to terminate, their obligations under the capped call agreements. Our exposure to the credit risk of these counterparties will not be secured by any collateral.
If any of these counterparties to one or more of the capped call transactions becomes subject to insolvency proceedings, we will become an unsecured creditor in those proceedings with a claim equal to our exposure at the time under such transaction. Our exposure will depend on many factors but, generally, our exposure will increase if the market price or the volatility of our common stock increases. In addition, upon a default or other failure to perform, or a termination of obligations, by a counterparty, we may suffer less relief from dilution than we currently anticipate with respect to our common stock. We can provide no assurances as to the financial stability or viability of these counterparties.
Risks Related to the Ownership of Our Common Stock
Our stock price has been volatile in the past and may be subject to volatility in the future.
The trading price of our common stock has been volatile historically, and is likely to continue to be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors described below. Factors affecting the market price of our securities include:
•
variations in our revenue, billings, gross margin, operating results, free cash flow, loss per share and how these results compare to analyst expectations;
•
forward looking guidance that we may provide regarding financial metrics such as billings, revenue, gross margin, operating results, free cash flow, and loss per share;
•
announcements of technological innovations, new products or services, strategic alliances, acquisitions or significant agreements by us or by our competitors;
•
disruptions in our cloud-based operations or services or disruptions of other prominent cloud-based operations or services;
•
the economy as a whole, market conditions in our industry, and the industries of our customers;
•
trading activity by directors, executive officers and significant stockholders, or the perception in the market that the holders of a large number of shares intend to sell their shares;
•
the size of our market float and significant option exercises;
•
any future issuances of securities;
•
repurchases of shares of our common stock by us, including through our Repurchase Program; and
•
any other factors discussed herein.
In addition, the stock markets in general and the Nasdaq Global Select Market in particular, have experienced substantial price and volume volatility that is often seemingly unrelated to the operating results of any particular companies. Moreover, if the market for technology stocks, especially security and cloud computing-related stocks, or the stock market in general experiences uneven investor confidence, the market price of our common stock could decline for reasons unrelated to our business, operating results or financial condition. The market price for our stock might also decline in reaction to events that affect other companies within, or outside, our industry, even if these events do not directly affect us. Some companies that have experienced volatility in the trading price of their stock have been subject of securities litigation. If we are the subject of such litigation, it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management’s attention and resources. Furthermore, market volatility arising from the COVID-19 pandemic may lead to increased shareholder activism if we experience a market valuation that they believe is not reflective of our intrinsic value. Activist campaigns that contest or conflict with our strategic direction or seek changes in the composition of our board of directors could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.
Share repurchases under our Repurchase Program could increase the volatility of the trading price of our common stock, could diminish our cash reserves, could occur at non-optimal prices and may not result in the most effective use of our capital.
On August 27, 2020, our board of directors approved a share repurchase program under which the Company is authorized to repurchase up to $300.0 million of its common stock. As of December 31, 2020, $160.6 million remained available for future share repurchases under the Repurchase Program. Share repurchases under the Repurchase Program could affect the price of our common stock, increase stock price volatility and diminish our cash reserves. In addition, an announcement of the reduction, suspension or termination of the Repurchase Program could result in a decrease in the trading price of our common stock. Moreover, our stock price could decline, resulting in repurchases made at non-optimal prices. Our failure to repurchase our stock at optimal prices may be perceived by investors as an inefficient use of our cash and cash equivalents, which could result in litigation that may have an adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. In addition, while our board of directors carefully considers various alternative uses of our cash and cash equivalents in determining whether to authorize stock repurchases, there can be no assurance that the decision by our board of directors to repurchase stock would result in the most effective uses of our cash and cash equivalents, and there may be alternative uses of our cash and cash equivalents that would be more effective, such as investing in growing our business organically or through acquisitions.
Anti-takeover provisions contained in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as well as provisions of Delaware law, and provisions in the indenture for our 2024 Notes, could impair a takeover attempt.
Our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could have the effect of rendering more difficult, delaying or preventing an acquisition of our company deemed undesirable by our board of directors. These provisions could also reduce the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock and result in the market price of our common stock being lower than it would be without these provisions. Our corporate governance documents include provisions:
•
creating a classified board of directors whose members serve staggered three-year terms;
•
authorizing “blank check” preferred stock, which could be issued by our board without stockholder approval which may contain voting, liquidation, dividend and other rights which are superior to our common stock;
•
limiting the liability of, and providing indemnification to, our directors and officers;
•
limiting the ability of our stockholders to call and bring business before special meetings by providing that any stockholder action must be effected at a duly called meeting of the stockholders and not by a consent in writing, and providing that only our board of directors, the chairman of our board of directors, our Chief Executive Officer or President may call a special meeting of the stockholders; and
•
requiring advance notice of stockholder proposals for business to be conducted at meetings of our stockholders and for nominations of candidates for election to our board of directors.
In addition, if a fundamental change occurs prior to the maturity date of the 2024 Notes, holders of the 2024 Notes will have the right, at their option, to require us to repurchase all or a portion of their 2024 Notes. If a “make-whole fundamental change” (as defined in the indenture) occurs prior to the maturity date, we will in some cases be required to increase the conversion rate of the 2024 Notes for a holder that elects to convert its 2024 Notes in connection with such make-whole fundamental change. Furthermore, the indenture prohibits us from engaging in certain mergers or acquisitions unless, among other things, the surviving entity assumes our obligations under the 2024 Notes.
These provisions, alone or together, could frustrate, delay or prevent hostile takeovers and changes in control or changes in our management.
As a Delaware corporation, we are also subject to provisions of Delaware law, including Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation law, which prevents some stockholders holding more than 15% of our outstanding common stock from engaging in certain business combinations merging or combining with us without approval of the holders of a substantial majority of all of our outstanding common stock.
Our failure to raise additional capital or generate the significant capital necessary to expand our operations and invest in new solutions could reduce our ability to compete and could harm our business.
We may need to raise additional funds, and we may not be able to obtain additional debt or equity financing on favorable terms, if at all. If we raise additional equity financing, our stockholders may experience significant dilution of their ownership interests and the per share value of our common stock could decline. If we issue equity securities in any additional financing, the new securities may have rights and preferences senior to our common stock. If we engage in debt financing, we may be required to accept terms that restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness and force us to maintain specified liquidity or other ratios. The trading prices for our common stock and the stock of other technology companies have been highly volatile as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, which may reduce our ability to access capital on favorable terms or at all. In addition, a recession, depression or other sustained adverse market event resulting from the spread of COVID-19 could materially and adversely affect our business and the value of our common stock. If we need additional capital and cannot raise it on acceptable terms, we may not be able to, among other things:
•
develop or enhance our application and services;
•
continue to expand our product development, sales and marketing organizations;
•
acquire complementary technologies, products or businesses;
•
expand operations, in the United States or internationally;
•
hire, train and retain employees; or
•
respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated working capital requirements.
Future sales of our common stock in the public market could lower the market price for our common stock and adversely impact the trading price of our common stock.
In the future, we may sell additional shares of our common stock to raise capital. In addition, a substantial number of shares of our common stock is reserved for issuance upon the conversion of the 2024 Notes, exercise of stock options, the vesting of restricted stock units and restricted stock pursuant to our employee benefit plans, and for purchase by employees under our employee stock purchase plan. We cannot predict the size of future issuances or the effect, if any, that they may have on the market price for our common stock. The issuance and sale of substantial amounts of common stock, or the perception that such issuances and sales may occur, could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities.
We do not anticipate paying cash dividends, and accordingly, stockholders must rely on stock appreciation for any return on their investment.
We do not anticipate paying cash dividends on our common stock in the future. As a result, only appreciation of the price of our common stock will provide a return to our stockholders. Investors seeking cash dividends should not invest in our common stock.
General Risk Factors
If we are required to collect sales and use taxes on the solutions we sell, we may be subject to liability for past sales and our future sales may decrease.
State and local taxing jurisdictions have differing rules and regulations governing sales and use taxes, and these rules and regulations are subject to varying interpretations that may change over time. In particular, the applicability of sales taxes to our subscription services in various jurisdictions is unclear. It is possible that we could face sales tax audits and that our liability for these taxes could exceed our estimates as state tax authorities could still assert that we are obligated to collect additional amounts as taxes from our customers and remit those taxes to those authorities. We could also be subject to audits with respect to state and international jurisdictions for which we have not accrued tax liabilities. A successful assertion that we should be collecting additional sales or other taxes on our services in jurisdictions where we have not historically done so and do not accrue for sales taxes could result in substantial tax liabilities for past sales, discourage customers from purchasing our application or otherwise harm our business and operating results.
Our business is subject to the risks of earthquakes, fire, power outages, floods and other catastrophic events, and to interruption by manmade problems such as terrorism.
Natural disasters or other catastrophic events may cause damage or disruption to our operations, international commerce and the global economy, and thus could have a strong negative effect on us. We have significant operations in the Silicon Valley area of Northern California, a region known for seismic activity and wildfires. A major earthquake, wildfire or other natural disaster, fire, act of terrorism or other catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our critical business operations or information technology systems could severely affect our ability to conduct normal business operations and, as a result, our future operating results could be harmed. These negative events could make it difficult or impossible for us to deliver our services to our customers, and could decrease demand for our services. Because we do not carry earthquake insurance for direct quake-related losses, and significant recovery time could be required to resume operations, our financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected in the event of a major earthquake or catastrophic event.","ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS
None.","ITEM 2. PROPERTIES
In November 2020, we relocated our corporate headquarters from 892 Ross Drive, Sunnyvale, California to 925 West Maude Avenue, Sunnyvale, California. Our new corporate headquarters at 925 West Maude Avenue, which includes our operations and research and development facilities, consists of approximately 242,400 square feet of space under a lease that expires in 2031, with a five-year extension option.
We lease additional U.S. offices in California, Utah, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, Indiana and Colorado. We also lease offices in Canada, France, Japan, the United Kingdom, Australia, Dubai and Israel. We believe our facilities are adequate for our current needs and for the foreseeable future. We operate fifteen data centers at third-party facilities throughout the world: nine in the United States, two in Canada, one in the Netherlands, one in France, one in Germany and one in Australia.","ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
From time to time, we may be involved in legal proceedings and subject to claims in the ordinary course of business.
Although the results of these proceedings and claims cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not believe the ultimate cost to resolve these matters would individually, or taken together, have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, cash flows or financial condition. Regardless of the outcome, such proceedings can have an adverse impact on us because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of resources and other factors, and there can be no assurances that favorable outcomes will be obtained.","ITEM 4.

Overview
Proofpoint is a leading next generation cybersecurity company that enables large and mid-sized organizations worldwide to protect their employees from advanced threats and compliance risks. Our security and compliance platform is comprised of an integrated suite of advanced threat protection, information protection, and brand protection solutions. These capabilities include email protection and authentication, advanced threat protection, data loss prevention, email encryption, SaaS application protection, response orchestration and automation, digital risk, security training, web browser isolation, archiving, eDiscovery, supervision, and secure communication. Our solutions are built on a flexible, cloud-based platform and leverage a number of proprietary technologies - including big data analytics, machine learning, deep content inspection, secure storage, advanced encryption, intelligent message routing, dynamic malware analysis, threat correlation, and virtual execution environments to address today’s rapidly changing threat and compliance landscape.
Our platform addresses this growing challenge by not only protecting data as it flows into and out of the enterprise via on-premises and cloud-based email, social media and other cloud applications, but also by keeping track of this information as it is modified and distributed throughout the enterprise for compliance and data loss prevention, and securely archiving these communications for compliance and discovery. We help organizations reduce their critical risk in five major ways:
•
Protecting users from the advanced attacks that target them via email, web, networks, social media, and cloud apps;
•
Preventing the theft or inadvertent loss of sensitive information and, in turn, ensuring compliance with regulatory data protection mandates;
•
Improving the resilience of end users to the threats that target them and training them to be better caretakers of their organizations’ critical data;
•
Collecting, retaining, supervising and discovering communications and sensitive data for compliance and litigation support; and
•
Enabling organizations to respond quickly to security issues, providing both the intelligence and the context to prioritize incidents and orchestrate remediation actions.
Our platform and its associated solutions are sold to customers on a subscription basis and can be deployed through our unique cloud-based architecture that leverages both our global data centers as well as optional points-of-presence behind our customers’ firewalls. Our flexible deployment model enables us to deliver superior security and compliance while maintaining the favorable economics afforded by cloud computing, creating a competitive advantage for us over legacy on-premises and cloud-only offerings.
We were founded in 2002 to provide a unified solution to help enterprises address their growing data security requirements. Our first solution was commercially released in 2003 to combat the burgeoning problem of spam and viruses and their impact on corporate email systems. To address the evolving threat landscape and the adoption of communication and collaboration systems beyond corporate email and networks, we have broadened our solutions to defend against a wide range of threats, including email, mobile apps and social media, to protect the information people create from both compromise and compliance risks, and to archive and govern corporate information. As the threat environment has continued to evolve, we have dedicated significant resources to meet the ongoing challenges that this highly dynamic environment creates for our customers such as investing significantly to expand the breadth of our data protection platform as these expenditures are primarily in connection with the replacement and upgrade of equipment to lower the cost of deployment as well as to improve the efficiency for our cloud-based architecture.
Our business is based on a recurring revenue model. Our customers pay a subscription fee to license the various components of our SaaS platform for a contract term that is typically one to three years. At the end of the license term, customers may renew their subscription and in each year since the launch of our first solution in 2003, we have maintained a renewal rate with our existing customers of 90% or higher. We derive this retention rate by calculating the total annually recurring subscription revenue from customers currently using our SaaS platform and dividing it by the total annually recurring subscription revenue from both these current customers as well as all business lost through non-renewal.
We market and sell our solutions worldwide both directly through our sales teams and indirectly through a hybrid model where our sales organization actively assists our network of distributors and resellers. We also derive a lesser portion of our total revenue from the license of our solutions to strategic partners who offer our solutions in conjunction with one or more of their own products or services.
Our solutions are designed to be implemented, configured and operated without the need for any training or professional services. We offer various training and professional services for those customers that seek to develop deeper expertise in the use of our solutions or would like assistance with complex configurations or the importing of data. In some cases, we provide a hardware appliance to those customers that elect to host elements of our solution behind their firewall. Increasing adoption of virtualization in the data center has led to a decline in the sales of our hardware appliances and a shift towards our software-based virtual appliances, which are delivered as a download via the Internet. Our hardware and services offerings carry lower margins and are provided as a courtesy to our customers. We expect the overall proportion of revenue derived from the hardware and services offerings to generally remain below 5% of our total revenue.
Historically, the majority of our revenue was derived from our customers in the United States. We believe the markets outside of the United States offer an opportunity for growth and we intend to make additional investments in sales and marketing to expand in these markets. Revenue from customers outside of the United States grew 25% for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the prior year. In terms of customer concentration, there were two partners who accounted for 13% and 11%, respectively, of our total revenue in 2020. In 2019, there were two partners who accounted for 12% and 11%, respectively, of our total revenue. In 2018, one partner accounted for 12% of our total revenue. These partners sold to a number of end users, none of which accounted for more than 10% of our total revenue in 2020, 2019 and 2018. The partners’ sales were spread across many individual customers, all of which have a direct relationship with us as part of their access to our demand services.
We have not been profitable to date and will need to grow revenue at a rate faster than our investments in cost of revenue and operating expenses in order to achieve profitability, as discussed in more detail below.
Significant Developments
In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, which continues to spread throughout the U.S. and the world and has resulted in authorities implementing numerous measures to contain the virus, including travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter-in-place orders, and business limitations and shutdowns. The Company’s overall financial results and operations were modestly impacted by the COVID-19 outbreak in 2020. The Company’s travel expense and marketing expense for in-person events were decreased due to global restrictions on travel issued by most major nations where the Company does business. We have shifted our internal annual Sales Kick Off conference, which was held in January 2021, to a virtual-only conference and in the near term we have changed our customer, employee and industry events to virtual-only formats. In addition, see Part II-Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” included herein for an update that we made to our existing risk factors to include information on risks associated with pandemics in general and COVID-19 specifically. The extent to which the COVID-19 outbreak impacts our financial results and operations going forward will depend on future developments which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new information which may emerge concerning the severity of the outbreak and the actions being taken to contain and treat it.
We are taking a variety of measures to ensure the availability and functioning of our critical infrastructure, to promote the safety and security of our employees and to support the communities in which we operate. These measures include requiring remote working arrangements for employees where practicable. We are following public and private sector policies and initiatives to reduce the transmission of COVID-19, such as the imposition of travel restrictions, the promotion of social distancing and the adoption of work-from-home arrangements, and all of these policies and initiatives could impact our operations. The COVID-19 pandemic presents extraordinary challenges in predicting future performance, and while we have modeled many scenarios and associated outcomes, there may be events or trends that are more dire than we have modeled given the unique nature of this event. In particular, we are monitoring COVID-19’s effects on our business across many dimensions, including its broad effects on customers in highly impacted industries and on key European economies as they each attempt to recover. These dimensions may change as the pandemic and the response to the pandemic evolve. Some of our customers impacted by COVID-19 seek to manage cash by executing shorter contract durations or by furloughing or laying off employees, especially in highly impacted industries such as travel and hospitality. Other customers are choosing to slow or defer projects, especially those in highly impacted industries and with complex projects requiring large archiving imports that rely heavily on third party resources to manage and execute. We will continue to monitor the
impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and continually assess its potential effects on our business and our outlook, the actual results of which will largely depend on future developments, including the duration and spread of the outbreak as well as the varied impacts to our customer base by region or industry, which cannot be accurately predicted and are uncertain.
Key Opportunities and Challenges
The total costs associated with the teams tasked with closing business with new customers and additional business with our existing customers have represented more than 90% of our total sales and marketing costs since 2008. Although we expect customers to be profitable over the duration of the customer relationship, the upfront costs typically exceed related revenue during the earlier periods of a contract. As a result, while our practice of invoicing our customers for the entire amount of the contract at the start of the term provides us with a relatively immediate contribution to cash flow, the revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the contract, and hence contributions toward operating income are limited in the period where the sales and marketing costs are incurred. Accordingly, an increase in the mix of new customers as a percentage of total customers would likely negatively impact our near-term operating results. On the other hand, we expect that an increase in the mix of existing customers as a percentage of total customers would positively impact our operating results over time. As we accumulate customers that continue to renew their contracts, we anticipate that our mix of existing customers will increase, contributing to a decrease in our sales and marketing costs as a percentage of total revenue and a commensurate improvement in our operating income.
As part of maintaining our SaaS platform, we provide ongoing updates and enhancements to the platform services both in terms of the software as well as the underlying hardware and data center infrastructure. These updates and enhancements are provided to our customers at no additional charge as part of the subscription fees paid for the use of our platform. While more traditional products eventually become obsolete and require replacement, we are constantly updating and maintaining our cloud-based services and as such they operate with a continuous product life cycle. Much of this work is designed to both maintain and enhance the customers’ experience over time while also lowering our costs to deliver the service. Our SaaS platform is a shared infrastructure that is used by all of our customers. Accordingly, the costs of the platform are spread in a relatively uniform manner across the entire customer base and no specific infrastructure elements are directly attached to any particular customer. As such, in the event that a customer chooses to not renew its subscription, the underlying resources are reallocated either to new customers or to accommodate the expanding needs of our existing customers and, as a result, we do not believe that the loss of any particular customer has a meaningful impact on our gross profit as long as we continue to grow our customer base.
Historically our customers have primarily used our cybersecurity and compliance solutions with email messaging content. Increasingly, customers are also adopting many of our emerging solutions as part of a people-centric approach to cybersecurity, which focuses on identifying and mitigating risks posed by individual users and the attacks that target them. Our people-centric portfolio includes CASB, Isolation, Insider Threat Management, and Proofpoint Security Awareness Training, many of which provide cyber resiliency across other vectors such as cloud, web and endpoint as well as security awareness training and phishing simulation.
With the majority of our business, we invoice our customers for the entire contract amount at the start of the term and these amounts are recorded as deferred revenue on our balance sheet, with the dollar weighted average duration of these contracts for any given period over the past three years typically ranging from 14 to 20 months. As a result, while our practice of invoicing customers for the entire amount of the contract at the start of the term provides us with a relatively immediate contribution to cash flow, the revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the contract, and hence contributions toward operating income are realized over an extended period. As such, our efforts to improve our profitability require us to invest far less in operating expenses than the cash flow generated by our business might otherwise allow. As we strive to invest in an effort to continue to increase the size and scale of our business, we expect that the level of investment afforded by our growth in revenue should be sufficient to fund the investments needed to drive revenue growth and broaden our product line.
Considering all of these factors, we do not expect to be profitable on a GAAP basis in the near term and in order to achieve profitability we will need to grow revenue at a rate faster than our investments in operating expenses and cost of revenue.
We intend to grow our revenue through acquiring new customers by investing in our sales and marketing activities. We believe that an increase in new customers in the near term will result in a larger base of renewal customers, which, over time, we expect to be more profitable for us.
Sales and marketing is our largest expense and hence a significant contributing factor to our operating losses. We believe that our opportunity to improve our return on investment on sales and marketing costs relies primarily on our ongoing ability to cost-effectively renew our business with existing customers, thereby lowering our overall sales and marketing costs as a percentage of revenue as the mix of revenue derived from this more profitable renewal activity increases over time. Therefore, we anticipate that our initial significant investments in sales and marketing activities will, over time, generate a larger base of more profitable customers. Cost of subscription revenue is also a significant expense for us, and we expect to continue to build on the improvements over the past years, such as in replacing third-party technology with our proprietary technology and improving the utilization of our fixed investments in equipment and infrastructure, in order to provide the opportunity for improved subscription gross margins over time.
Although we plan to continue enhancing our solutions, we intend to lower our rate of investment in research and development as a percentage of revenue over time by deriving additional revenue from our existing solutions rather than by adding entirely new categories of solutions. In addition, as personnel costs are one of the primary drivers of the increases in our operating expenses, we plan to reduce our historical rate of headcount growth over time.
Key Metrics
We regularly review a number of metrics, including the following key metrics presented in the table below, to evaluate our business, measure our performance, identify trends in our business, prepare financial projections and make strategic decisions. Many of these key metrics, such as non-GAAP gross margin, billings and free cash flow, are non-GAAP measures. This non-GAAP information is not necessarily comparable to non-GAAP information of other companies. Users of this financial information should consider the types of events and transactions for which adjustments have been made.

Non-GAAP gross margin
We define non-GAAP gross margin as non-GAAP gross profit divided by GAAP revenue. We define non-GAAP gross profit as GAAP gross profit, adjusted to exclude stock-based compensation expense and the amortization of intangibles associated with acquisitions. We consider this non-GAAP financial measure to be a useful metric for management and investors because it excludes the effect of stock-based compensation expense and the amortization of intangibles associated with acquisitions so that our management and investors can compare our business operating results over multiple periods, and compare our financial results with other companies in its industry, many of which present similar non-GAAP financial measure. However, there are a number of limitations related to the use of non-GAAP gross margin versus gross margin calculated in accordance with GAAP. For example, stock-based compensation has been and will continue to be for the foreseeable future a significant recurring expense in our business. Stock-based compensation is an important part of our employees’ compensation and impacts their performance. In addition, the components of the costs that we exclude in our calculation of non-GAAP gross margin may differ from the components that our peer companies exclude when they report their non-GAAP results. Management compensates for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from non-GAAP gross margin and evaluating non-GAAP gross margin together with gross margin calculated in accordance with GAAP.

Billings
We have included billings, a non-GAAP financial measure, in this report because it is a key measure used by our management and board of directors to manage our business and monitor our near term cash flows. We define billings as revenue recognized plus the change in deferred revenue and customer prepayments less unbilled accounts receivable from the beginning to the
end of the period, but excluding additions to deferred revenue and customer prepayments from acquisitions. We have provided reconciliation between total revenue, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, and billings. Accordingly, we believe that billings provide useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management and board of directors.
Our use of billings as a non-GAAP measure has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for revenue or an analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are:
•
Billings are not a substitute for revenue, as trends in billings are not necessarily directly correlated to trends in revenue;
•
Billings are affected by a combination of factors including the timing of renewals, the sales of our solutions to both new and existing customers, the relative duration of contracts sold, and the relative amount of business derived from strategic partners. As each of these elements has unique characteristics in the relationship between billings and revenue, our billings activity is not necessarily closely correlated to revenue; and
•
Other companies, including companies in our industry, may not use billings, may calculate billings differently, or may use other financial measures to evaluate their performance - all of which reduce the usefulness of billings as a comparative measure.
Our deferred revenue consists of amounts that have been invoiced but have not been recognized as revenue as of the period end. Customer prepayments represent billed amounts for which the contract can be terminated and the customer has a right of refund. Unbilled accounts receivable represent amounts for which we have recognized revenue, pursuant to our revenue recognition policy, for subscription software already delivered and professional services already performed, but billed in arrears and for which we believe we have an unconditional right to payment.

Free cash flows
We define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities minus capital expenditures. We consider free cash flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the business that, after the acquisition of property and equipment, can be used for strategic opportunities, including investing in our business, making strategic acquisitions, and strengthening the balance sheet. Analysis of free cash flow facilitates management’s comparisons of our operating results to competitors’ operating results. A limitation of using free cash flow versus the GAAP measure of net cash provided by operating activities as a means for evaluating our company is that free cash flow does not represent the total increase or decrease in the cash balance from operations for the period because it excludes cash used for capital expenditures during the period. Management compensates for this limitation by providing information about our capital expenditures on the face of the cash flow statement and in the “Liquidity and Capital Resources” section below.

Components of Our Results of Operations
Revenue
We derive our revenue primarily through the license of various solutions and services on our security-as-a-service platform on a subscription basis, supplemented by the sales of training, professional services and hardware depending upon our customers’ requirements.
Subscription. We license our platform and its associated solutions and services on a subscription basis. The fees are charged on a per user, per year basis. Subscriptions are typically one to three years in duration. We invoice our customers upon signing for the entire term of the contract. The invoiced non-cancellable amounts billed in advance are treated as deferred revenue on the balance sheet and are recognized ratably, in accordance with the appropriate revenue recognition guidelines, over the term of the contract. We also derive a portion of our subscription revenue from the license of our solutions to strategic partners. We bill these strategic partners monthly. We expect our subscription revenue will continue to grow and remain above 95% of our total revenue.
Hardware and services. We provide hardware appliances as a convenience to our customers and as such it represents a small part of our business. Our solutions are designed to be implemented, configured and operated without the need for any training or professional services. For those customers that seek to develop deeper expertise in the use of our solutions or would like assistance with complex configurations or the importing of data, we offer various training and professional services. We typically invoice the customer for hardware at the time of shipment. We typically invoice customers for services at the time the order is placed and recognize this revenue as the services are performed. On occasion, customers may retain us for special projects such as archiving import and export services; these types of services are recognized upon completion of the project. We expect the overall proportion of revenue derived from hardware and service offerings to generally remain below 5% of our total revenue.
Cost of Revenue
Our cost of revenues consists of cost of subscription revenue and cost of hardware and services revenue. Personnel costs, which consist of salaries, benefits, bonuses, stock-based compensation, data center costs and hardware costs, are the most significant components of our cost of revenues. We expect personnel costs to continue to increase in absolute dollars as we hire new employees to continue to grow our business.
Cost of Subscription Revenue. Cost of subscription revenue primarily includes personnel costs, consisting of salaries, benefits, bonuses, and stock-based compensation, for employees who provide support services to our customers and operate our data centers. Other costs include fees paid to contractors who supplement our support and data center personnel; expenses related to the use of third-party data centers in both the United States and internationally; depreciation of data center equipment; amortization of licensing fees and royalties paid for the use of third-party technology; amortization of internally developed intangible assets; and the amortization of intangible assets acquired through business combinations. Growth in subscription revenue generally consumes production resources, requiring us to gradually increase our cost of subscription revenue in absolute dollars as we expand our investment in data center equipment, the third-party data center space required to house this equipment, and the personnel needed to manage this higher level of activity.
Cost of Hardware and Services Revenue. Cost of hardware and services revenue includes personnel costs for employees who provide training and professional services to our customers as well as the cost of server hardware shipped to our customers that we procure from third parties and configure with our software solutions.
Operating Expenses
Our operating expenses consist of research and development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative expenses. Personnel costs, which consist of salaries, benefits, bonuses, and stock-based compensation, are the most significant component of our operating expenses. Our headcount has increased from 2,613 employees as of December 31, 2018 to 3,658 employees as of December 31, 2020. As a result of this growth in headcount, operating expenses have increased significantly over these periods. We expect personnel costs to continue to increase in absolute dollars as we hire new employees to continue to grow our business.
Research and Development. Research and development expenses include personnel costs, consulting services and depreciation. We believe that these investments have played an important role in broadening the capabilities of our platform over the course of our operating history, enhancing the relevance of our solutions in the market in general and helping us to retain our customers over time. We expect to continue to devote substantial resources to research and development in an effort to continuously improve our existing solutions as well as to develop new offerings. We believe that these investments are necessary to maintain and improve our competitive position. However, over the longer term, we intend to monitor these costs so as to decrease this spending as a percentage of total revenue. Our research efforts include both software developed for our internal use on behalf of our customers as well as software elements to be used by our customers in their own facilities. To date, our capitalized costs on software developed for internal use on behalf of our customers were not material. For the software developed for use on our customers’ premises, the costs associated with the development work between technological feasibility and the general availability has not been material and as such we have not capitalized any of these development costs to date.
Sales and Marketing. Sales and marketing expenses include personnel costs, sales commissions, and other costs including travel and entertainment, marketing and promotional events, public relations and marketing activities. These costs also include amortization of intangible assets as a result of our past acquisitions. Due to our continued investment in growing our sales and marketing operations, both domestically and internationally, headcount increases were reflected in higher compensation expense consistent with our revenue growth. Our sales personnel are typically not immediately productive, and therefore the increase in sales and marketing expenses we incur when we add new sales representatives is not immediately offset by increased revenue and may not result in increased revenue over the long-term if these new sales people fail to become productive. The timing of our hiring of new sales personnel and the rate at which they generate incremental revenue will affect our future financial performance. We expect that sales and marketing expenses will continue to increase in absolute dollars and be among the most significant components of our operating expenses.
General and Administrative. General and administrative expenses consist of personnel costs, consulting services, audit fees, tax services, legal expenses and other general corporate items. As a result of our operational growth, we expect our general and administrative expenses to increase in absolute dollars in future periods as we continue to expand our operations and hire additional personnel.
Interest Expense
Interest expense consists of interest expense and loss on conversion related to our convertible senior notes.
Other Income, Net
Other income, net, consists primarily of interest income earned on our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, and the net effect of foreign currency transaction gains and losses.
Income Taxes
For most of the prior years, our income tax expense or benefit were primarily related to state and foreign income taxes. As we have incurred operating losses in all periods to date and recorded a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets, we had not historically recorded a provision for federal income taxes. However, in the year ended December 31, 2018, we recognized $14.7 million of deferred tax benefit in the U.S. related to changes in the Company’s valuation allowance resulting from the Wombat Security Technologies, Inc. acquisition. For the year ended December 31, 2019, we recognized $0.3 million of deferred tax benefit in the U.S. related to amortization of tax goodwill on certain business acquisitions. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we recognized $0.2 million of deferred tax expense in the U.S. related to amortization of tax goodwill on certain business acquisitions. Realization of any of our deferred tax assets depends upon future earnings, the timing and amount of which are uncertain. Utilization of our net operating losses and research and development credits may be subject to substantial annual limitation due to the ownership change limitations provided by the Internal Revenue Code and similar state provisions. Analyses have been conducted to determine whether an ownership change had occurred since inception. The analyses have indicated that although ownership changes have occurred in prior years, the net operating losses and research and development credits would not expire before utilization as a result of the ownership change. In the event we have subsequent changes in ownership, net operating losses and research and development credit carryovers could be limited and may expire unutilized as a result of the subsequent ownership change.

Subscription revenue increased $156.0 million and $170.6 million, or 18% and 24%, respectively, for 2020 and 2019. These increases were due to a $114.3 million and $128.6 million increase in revenue from the United States and a $41.7 million and $42.0 million increase from international customers for 2020 and 2019, respectively.
The increases in subscription revenue for 2020 and 2019 were due to the ongoing demand for our solutions, increase in add-on activity and renewal rate being 90% or higher. Our enterprise customer count, which consists of customers that generate more than $10,000 in annual recurring revenue, increased from approximately 7,100 at the end of 2019 to approximately 8,000, or 13%, at the end of 2020. We had 6,100 enterprise customers at the end of 2018. In addition, the number of customers with three or more products increased 39% in 2020 and 38% in 2019 as compared to 2019 and 2018, respectively. The revenue recognized from acquired deferred revenue related to the acquisitions we made was $5.5 million, $5.8 million and $20.8 million in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The change in subscription revenue due to pricing was not significant for either period.
Hardware and services revenue for 2020 increased $5.8 million, or 44%, as compared to 2019, primarily due to an increase in hardware revenue of $1.8 million and an increase in professional service revenue of $4.0 million primarily due to the timing of completion of service. Hardware and services revenue for 2019 increased $0.6 million or 5%, as compared to 2018, primarily due to higher professional service revenue.

Cost of subscription revenue increased $33.6 million, or 16%, in 2020 as compared to 2019, and $26.7 million, or 15%, in 2019 as compared to 2018. The increases were primarily due to increases in operations-related expense of $23.9 million and $13.9 million, respectively, due to increased headcount, network expense due to an increase in usage, depreciation expense as a result of higher capital expenditures to support our growth, and larger amortization of intangible assets expense of developed technology from recent acquisitions. Additionally, support-related expenses increased $10.5 million and $10.9 million, respectively, primarily due to higher headcount and consulting costs.
Cost of hardware and services revenue for 2020 and 2019 increased $5.6 million and $7.7 million, or 19% and 36%, respectively, as compared to the year before, primarily due to increase in professional service costs of $4.5 million and $7.6 million, respectively, as our headcount increased. Additionally, the cost of hardware units sold increased $0.8 million in 2020.

Research and development expenses increased $53.3 million and $45.1 million, or 23% and 24%, for 2020 and 2019, respectively. The increases were primarily due to increases in personnel-related costs of $47.6 million and $40.3 million for 2020 and 2019, respectively, from higher headcount, including those from the integration of the acquisitions in 2020 and 2019. Additionally, corporate expense allocated to research and development increased $3.2 million and $4.7 million for 2020 and 2019, respectively, primarily due to higher costs from expanded operations, higher allocated costs from facilities, human resources and IT-related expense as we grew year-over-year.

Sales and marketing expenses increased $71.5 million and $71.3 million, or 17% and 21%, for 2020 and 2019, respectively. The increase in headcount on a worldwide basis and increase in revenue resulted in increased personnel-related and commissions costs of $78.1 million and $59.7 million, for 2020 and 2019, respectively. Corporate and facilities expenses allocated to sales and marketing increased $3.9 million in 2020 and $2.6 million in 2019 due to costs related to our acquisitions and higher allocated costs as the company expanded. Amortization expense of acquired intangible assets increased $1.3 million and $0.7 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively. These increases for 2020 were partially offset by the decreases of $11.4 million in travel expense due to travel restrictions imposed by COVID-19. Travel expenses increased $4.2 million in 2019, while marketing expenses related to lead generation, trade shows, advertising and other initiatives increased $6.1 million in 2019.

General and administrative expenses decreased $12.0 million, or 11%, in 2020 as compared to 2019. In the three months ended June 30, 2020, management determined that the performance conditions for certain performance stock units were not probable to be achieved, as a result, due to the change in estimate and cumulative catch-up adjustment, the expense associated with those performance stock units decreased $17.9 million in 2020, as compared to 2019. Additionally, a non-recurring one-year RSU grant to the Chief Executive Officer fully vested in June 2019, and, as such the expense in 2020 were reduced $6.5 million. Remaining personnel-related costs increased $13.7 million due to an increase in headcount to support our continued growth as a public company. Outside consulting and audit costs decreased $4.5 million, and acquisition related costs decreased $2.5 million primarily due to the timing of business acquisitions made. The decreases were partially offset by a $2.9 million increase in corporate and facilities expense due to an increase in headcount. Legal expense increased $3.7 million primarily due to trade secret litigation brought by us against a third party.

Interest expense increased $23.7 million in 2020 as compared to 2019, due to the 2024 Notes issued on August 23, 2019. The increases consisted of higher accretion of $22.2 million and higher cash interest expense of $1.5 million.
Interest expense for 2018 consisted of the 2020 Notes accretion expense of $8.4 million, loss on conversion of the 2020 Notes of $7.2 million and cash interest expense of $1.2 million (see Note 10 “Convertible Senior Notes” to the Consolidated Financial Statements).

Other income, net decreased $6.6 million in 2020 as compared to 2019, primarily due to a $5.4 million decrease in interest income from cash and investments due to a reduction in investments and lower interest rate, and a $1.0 million increase in foreign currency translation loss.
Other income, net increased $5.6 million in 2019 as compared to 2018 because of an increase in interest income of $6.3 million due to higher cash and investment balances, partially offset by a $0.9 million increase in foreign currency translation losses.

Total provision for income taxes increased $13.0 million in 2020 as compared to 2019. The increase was primarily due to an increase of tax expense of $9.4 million related to the transfers of intellectual property between our consolidated entities, a $2.8 million increase of foreign taxes related to operations in our non-US subsidiaries and a $1.0 million increase related to uncertain tax positions.
Total provision for income taxes increased $33.1 million in 2019 as compared to 2018. The increase was primarily due to a transfer of intellectual property from Israel to the U.S., which occurred in 2019 and resulted in $17.7 million of tax expense, combined with a $14.7 million deferred tax benefit, which occurred in 2018 related to changes in the U.S. valuation allowance resulting from the Wombat business acquisition.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
As of December 31, 2020, we had $910.3 million in cash and cash equivalents. Also refer to Note 10 “Convertible Senior Notes” to the consolidated financial statements for discussion of the 2024 Notes. The Company’s financial condition and liquidity remain strong. Net cash provided by operations was $264.5 million in 2020 compared to $242.5 million in 2019. Although there is uncertainty related to the anticipated impact of the recent COVID-19 outbreak on the Company’s future results, we believe our efficient business model leaves us positioned to manage our business through this crisis as it continues to unfold. We continue to manage all aspects of our business including, but not limited to, monitoring the financial health of our customers, suppliers and other third-party relationships, implementing gross margin enhancement strategies and developing new opportunities for growth. We have also not observed any impairments of our assets or a significant change in the fair value of assets due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
On August 27, 2020, our board of directors approved a share repurchase program under which the Company is authorized to repurchase up to $300.0 million of the Company’s common stock. Repurchases under the Repurchase Program may be made through open market purchases (including through trading plans administered under pre-determined purchasing criteria), block trades and/or privately negotiated transactions, subject to market conditions, applicable legal requirements, and other relevant factors. The timing, volume and nature of the repurchases are at the discretion of management, based on its evaluation of the capital needs of the Company, market conditions, applicable legal requirements and other factors. The Repurchase Program does not have an expiration date and may be suspended or discontinued by the Company at any time without prior notice. We plan to grow our customer base by continuing to emphasize investments in sales and marketing to add new customers, expand our customers’ use of our platform, and maintain high renewal rates. We also expect to incur additional cost of subscription revenue in accordance with the resulting growth in our customer base. We believe that the combination of our ongoing improvements in gross margins, the benefits of lower sales and marketing costs associated with our renewal activity, and the fact that our contracts are structured to bill our customers in advance should enable us to improve our cash flow from operations as we grow. Based on our current level of operations and anticipated growth, both of which are expected to be consistent with recent quarters, we believe that our existing sources of liquidity will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next 12 months. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including our rate of revenue growth, the expansion of our sales and marketing activities, and the timing and extent of spending to support product development efforts and expansion into new territories, and the timing of introductions of new features and enhancements to our solutions. To the extent that existing cash and cash equivalents and cash from operations are insufficient to fund our future activities, we may need to raise additional funds through public or private equity or debt financing. We have invested, and plan to continue investing in acquiring complementary businesses, applications and technologies, and may continue to make such investments in the future, any of which could also require us to seek equity or debt financing. Additional funds may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all.
As of December 31, 2020, the amount of cash and cash equivalents held by our foreign subsidiaries was $66.6 million, including intercompany receivable balances. If these funds were needed for our operations in the United States, we would be required to withhold foreign taxes on the funds repatriated of approximately $0.8 million. We have not recorded a liability for these taxes, as it is our intention that the majority of these funds are indefinitely reinvested outside the United States and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate these funds to our United States operations.
Due to negative earnings and profits in our foreign subsidiaries, we have not recorded a provisional tax liability relating to the one-time mandatory transition tax imposed by the Tax Act on our accumulated foreign earnings. As the Tax Act also eliminates U.S. taxes on foreign subsidiary distributions, future earnings in foreign jurisdictions will be available for distribution to the U.S. without incremental U.S. taxes.

Operating Activities
Our net loss and cash flows from operating activities are significantly influenced by our investments in headcount and data center operations to support anticipated growth. Our cash flows are also influenced by cash payments from customers. We invoice customers for the entire contract amount at the start of the term, and as such our cash flow from operations is also affected by the length of a customer contract.
Net cash provided by operating activities was $264.5 million in 2020 as compared to $242.5 million in 2019. The increase of $22.0 million was primarily due to:
•
An increase in amortization of intangible assets of $11.9 million due to acquired businesses, and an increase in depreciation of fixed assets of $3.8 million due to an increase in capital expenditures;
•
A $12.4 million increase in amortization of deferred commissions primarily due to corresponding increase in revenue;
•
An increase in stock-based compensation expense of $10.4 million due to the increase in headcount and grants made, partially offset by catch-up adjustments made to performance stock unit expense;
•
A $22.2 million increase in amortization of debt issuance costs and accretion of debt discount for the 2024 Notes issued in the third quarter of 2019;
•
An increase in accounts receivable change of $71.5 million due to the timing of payments;
•
A $10.7 million increase in accrued liabilities change due to a $5.1 million increase in uncertain tax benefit change as well as the timing of other payments made; and
•
An increase in noncash lease costs of $3.9 million was primarily due to additional costs related to the new corporate office lease and leases acquired via business acquisitions.
The increase was partially offset by:
•
An increase in net loss of $33.5 million;
•
A $9.8 million decrease in accounts payable change due to the timing of payments; and
•
A decrease in deferred revenue change of $71.0 million primarily due to the timing of billings and revenue recognized; and
•
A decrease in deferred commission change of $11.2 million primarily due to an increase in billings.
Net cash provided by operating activities was $242.5 million in 2019 as compared to $184.7 million in 2018. The increase of $57.8 million was primarily due to:
•
An increase in amortization of intangible assets of $4.5 million due to acquired businesses, and an increase in depreciation of fixed assets of $2.3 million due to an increase in capital expenditures;
•
An increase in stock-based compensation expense of $33.6 million due to the increase in headcount and grants made;
•
An increase in amortization of debt issuance costs and accretion of debt discount of $3.3 million due to the issuance of the 2024 Notes (see Note 10 “Convertible Senior Notes” to the Consolidated Financial Statements);
•
An increase in amortization of deferred commissions of $13.3 million due to an increase in revenue;
•
A $23.3 million increase in noncash lease costs primarily due to the adoption of ASC 842 effective January 1, 2019;
•
A decrease in benefit from deferred income taxes of $12.9 million primarily due to a decrease in valuation allowance due to the business acquisition made in 2018;
•
A decrease in accounts receivable change of $19.7 million due to the timing of payments;
•
An increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities changes of $4.0 million primarily due to the timing of compensation and other payments; and
•
An increase in deferred revenue change of $23.6 million due to higher billings.
The increase was offset by a $26.5 million increase in net loss, $7.2 million decrease in loss on conversion due to the 2020 Notes converted into common shares in the third quarter of 2018 (see Note 10 “Convertible Senior Notes” to the Consolidated Financial Statements), $24.5 million decrease in operating lease liabilities change primarily due to the adoption of ASC 842 effective January 1, 2019, an increase in deferred commissions change of $14.3 million due to higher billings, and an increase in prepaid expense change of $6.0 million due to the timing of payments.
Investing Activities
Our primary investing activities consisted of acquisitions of businesses, capital expenditures in support of expanding our infrastructure and workforce and the purchase and sale of short-term investments. As our business grows, we expect our capital expenditures and our investment activity to continue to increase. We may also target other companies for acquisition.
Net cash used in investing activities was $31.8 million in 2020 as compared to $349.5 million in 2019. The decrease in cash used in investing activities of $317.7 million was primarily due to a $314.4 million decrease in payments for acquired businesses, and a $71.1 million decrease in cash spent to acquire short-term investments, offset by a $30.7 million decrease in maturities of short-term investments, and a $37.2 million increase in capital expenditures primarily due to a $34.6 million increase in new corporate campus related payments.
Net cash used in investing activities was $349.5 million in 2019 as compared to $250.7 million in 2018. The increase in cash used of $98.8 million was due to an increase in cash paid for business acquisitions of $93.4 million, a decrease in proceeds from sales of short-term investments of $11.9 million, an increase in purchase of short-term investments of $12.3 million, an increase in capital expenditure of $5.7 million, and a decrease in receipts from escrow account of $3.3 million, partially offset by an increase in maturities of short-term investments of $27.8 million.
Financing Activities
Net cash used in financing activities was $174.5 million in 2020 as compared to $778.7 million provided by financing activities in 2019. The increase in cash used in financing activities of $953.3 million was primarily due to $901.3 million proceeds from issuance of the 2024 Notes in 2019, net of costs; $139.4 million paid to repurchase commons stock in 2020, and a $3.4 million increase in withholding taxes paid related to restricted stock net share settlement, partially offset by $84.6 million used to purchase capped calls in connection with the issuance of the 2024 Notes in 2019 and a $6.2 million increase in proceeds from common stock issuance related to employee stock plans.
Net cash provided by financing activities was $778.7 million in 2019 as compared to $33.9 million used in 2018. The increase in cash provided of $812.6 million was primarily due to $901.3 million in proceeds from issuance of the 2024 Notes, net of costs, partially offset by $84.6 million used to purchase capped calls in connection with the issuance of the 2024 Notes, and a $5.3 million increase in withholding taxes paid related to restricted stock net share settlement.

(3)
As we are unable to reasonably predict the timing of settlement of liabilities related to unrecognized tax benefits, net, the table does not include $34.9 million of such non-current liabilities included in Other long-term liabilities recorded on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2020.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
During the periods presented, we did not have, nor do we currently have, any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. We are therefore not exposed to any financing, liquidity, market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in those types of relationships.
Under the indemnification provisions of our standard customer agreements, we agree to indemnify, defend and hold harmless our customers against, among other things, infringement of any patents, trademarks or copyrights under any country’s laws or the misappropriation of any trade secrets arising from the customer’s legal use of our solutions. Certain indemnification provisions potentially expose us to losses in excess of the aggregate amount paid to us by the customer under the applicable customer agreement. No material claims have been made against us pursuant to these indemnification provisions to date.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Our management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. GAAP requires us to make certain estimates and judgments that can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingencies, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. If actual results or events differ materially from those contemplated by us in making these estimates, our reported financial condition and results of operations for future periods could be materially affected. See “Risk Factors” for certain matters that may affect our future financial condition or results of operations. An accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are uncertain at the time the estimate is made, if different estimates reasonably could have been used, or if the changes in estimate that are reasonably likely to occur could materially impact the financial statements.
Our significant accounting policies, including those considered to be critical accounting policies, are summarized in Note 1 “The Company and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” to the accompanying consolidated financial statements in this report. The following critical accounting policies reflect significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements:
•
Revenue recognition;
•
Deferred commissions;
•
Fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations;
•
Impairment assessment of goodwill, intangible assets and other long-lived assets;
•
Loss contingencies;
•
Stock-based compensation; and
•
Recognition and measurement of current and deferred income taxes.
Revenue Recognition
The Company derives its revenue primarily from: (1) subscription service revenue; (2) subscription software revenue, and (3) hardware and services, which include professional service and training revenue provided to customers related to their use of the platform. Subscription service revenue is derived from a subscription-based enterprise licensing model with contract terms typically ranging from one to three years, and consists of (1) subscription fees from the licensing of the Company’s security-as-a-service platform and it’s various components, (2) subscription fees for software with support and related future updates where the software updates are critical to the customers’ ability to derive benefit from the software due to the fast changing nature of the technology. These function together as one performance obligation, and (3) subscription fees for the right to access the Company’s customer support services for software with significant standalone functionality and support services for hardware. Subscription software revenue is primarily derived from term-based software that is deployed on the customers’ own servers and has significant standalone functionality, is recognized upon transfer of control to the customer.
We apply significant judgment in identifying and evaluating any terms and conditions in contracts which may impact revenue recognition. Most of the Company’s contracts with customers contain multiple performance obligations. Determining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together may require judgment. For these contracts, we account for individual performance obligations separately if they are distinct. The transaction price is allocated to individual performance obligation on a relative standalone selling price basis. The transaction price allocated to subscription services and subscription software that does not have significant standalone functionality is determined by considering factors such as historical pricing practices, and the selling price of hardware and professional services is estimated using a cost plus model. The selling price for support of a functional subscription software license is calculated as a percentage of functional subscription software license value which is derived by analyzing internal pricing practice, customer expectations, and industry practice.
Deferred Commissions
We capitalize sales commissions and associated payroll taxes paid to internal sales personnel, and referral fees paid to independent third-parties, that are incremental to the acquisition of customer contracts. These costs are recorded as deferred commissions on the consolidated balance sheets. We determine whether costs should be deferred based on sales compensation plans, if the commissions are incremental and would not have occurred absent the customer contract. Sales commissions for renewal of a subscription contract are not considered commensurate with the commissions paid for the acquisition of the initial subscription contract given the substantive difference in commission rate between new and renewal contracts. Commissions paid upon the initial acquisition of a contract are amortized over an estimated period of benefit of five years while commissions paid related to renewal contracts are amortized over a contractual renewal period. Amortization is recognized based on the expected future revenue streams under the customer contracts. Amortization of deferred sales commissions is included in sales and marketing expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. We determine the period of benefit for commissions paid for the acquisition of the initial subscription contract by taking into consideration its initial estimated customer life and the technological life of the Company’s software and related significant features.
Fair Value of Assets Acquired and Liabilities Assumed in Business Combinations
In each of our acquisitions, we used the purchase method of accounting which requires us to allocate the fair value of the total consideration transferred to tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values on the date of the acquisition, with the difference between the net assets acquired and the total consideration transferred recorded as goodwill. The fair values assigned, defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between willing market participants, are based on significant estimates and assumptions determined by
management. These estimates and assumptions are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement, as a result, during the adjustment period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, we may record adjustments to the assets acquired or liabilities assumed with any corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded within our consolidated statements of operations.
We used either the Discounted Cash Flow Method, the Cost to Recreate Method or the Relief from Royalty Method to assign fair values to acquired identifiable intangible assets. Management applies significant judgment in estimating the fair value of these intangible assets, which involved the use of significant assumptions with respect to forecasted future revenue, forecasted operating results, cost and time to build the acquired technology, developer’s profit, rate of return, royalty rates and discount rates. These models are based on reasonable estimates and assumptions given available facts and circumstances, including industry estimates and averages, as of the acquisition dates and are consistent with the plans and estimates that we use to manage our business. If the subsequent actual results and updated projections of the underlying business activity change compared with the estimates and assumptions used to develop these values, we could experience impairment charges. In addition, we have estimated the economic lives of certain acquired assets and these lives are used to calculate depreciation and amortization expense. If our estimates of the economic lives change, depreciation or amortization expenses could be accelerated or slowed.
Accounting for business combinations requires our management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially at the acquisition date including our estimates for intangible assets as described above, contractual obligations assumed, restructuring liabilities, pre-acquisition contingencies and contingent consideration, where applicable. Although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate, they are based in part on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain.
Unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates or actual results.
For a given acquisition, we may identify certain pre-acquisition contingencies as of the acquisition date and may extend our review and evaluation of these pre-acquisition contingencies throughout the measurement period in order to obtain sufficient information to assess whether we include these contingencies as a part of the fair value estimates of assets acquired and liabilities assumed and, if so, to determine their estimated amounts.
If we cannot reasonably determine the fair value of a pre-acquisition contingency (non-income tax related) by the end of the measurement period, which is generally the case given the nature of such matters, we will recognize an asset or a liability for such pre-acquisition contingency if: (i) it is probable that an asset existed or a liability had been incurred at the acquisition date and (ii) the amount of the asset or liability can be reasonably estimated. Subsequent to the measurement period, changes in our estimates of such contingencies will affect earnings and could have a material effect on our results of operations and financial position.
In addition, uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances assumed in connection with a business combination are initially estimated as of the acquisition date. We reevaluate these items quarterly based upon facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date with any adjustments to our preliminary estimates being recorded to goodwill if identified within the measurement period. Subsequent to the measurement period or our final determination of the tax allowance’s or contingency’s estimated value, whichever comes first, changes to these uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances will affect our provision for income taxes in our consolidated statements of operations and could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position.
Goodwill, Intangible Assets and Other Long-Lived Assets - Impairment Assessments
We review goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate its carrying value may not be recoverable. For the purposes of impairment testing, we have determined that we have one reporting unit. We perform the two-step impairment test, whereby we compare the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that unit, goodwill is not considered impaired and we are not required to perform further testing. If the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit, then we will record an impairment charge in the amount by which a reporting unit’s carrying value exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill.
We periodically review the carrying amounts of intangible assets and other long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable. We measure the recoverability of these assets by comparing the carrying amount of such assets (or asset group) to the future undiscounted cash flow we expect the assets (or asset group) to generate. If we consider any of these assets to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized equals the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds its fair value. We make judgments about the recoverability of purchased intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may exist.
Each period we evaluate the estimated remaining useful lives of intangible assets and other long-lived assets to assess whether a revision to the remaining periods of amortization is required. Assumptions and estimates about remaining useful lives of our intangible and other long-lived assets are subjective. They can be affected by a variety of factors, including external factors such as industry and economic trends and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy. Although we believe the historical assumptions and estimates we have made are reasonable and appropriate, different assumptions and estimates could materially impact our reported financial results. We did not recognize any intangible asset impairment charges to date.
Loss contingencies
We evaluate contingent liabilities including threatened or pending litigation in accordance with the authoritative guidance on contingencies. We assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes from potential claims or legal proceedings, as well as potential ranges of probable losses, when the outcomes of the claims or proceedings are probable and reasonably estimable. A determination of the amount of accrued liabilities required, if any, for these contingencies is made after the analysis of each separate matter. Because of uncertainties related to these matters, we base our estimates on the information available at the time of our assessment. As additional information becomes available, we reassess the potential liability related to our pending claims and litigation and may revise our estimates. Any revisions in the estimates of potential liabilities could have a material impact on our operating results and financial position.
Stock-based compensation
We grant performance stock units (PSUs) to key executives. The vesting of the PSUs is subject to the executive’s continuing employment and the Company's achievement of certain performance goals. We recognize share-based compensation expense for the PSUs on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for each separately vesting portion of the award when it is probable that the performance conditions will be achieved. At each reporting period, we estimate the probability of achieving the specified performance targets associated with each PSUs. Changes in the probability estimates associated with the PSUs are accounted for in the period of change using a cumulative catch up adjustment to apply the new probability estimate. In any period in which we determine the achievement of the performance targets is not probable, we cease recording compensation expense and all previously recognized compensation expense for the PSUs is reversed.
Income Taxes
We determine our current and deferred tax provisions based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in our income tax returns filed during the subsequent year. We record adjustments based on filed returns when we have identified and finalized them, which is generally in the fourth quarter of the subsequent year for U.S. federal and state provisions, respectively. We have placed a full valuation allowance on all net U.S. deferred tax assets because realization of these tax benefits through future taxable income cannot be reasonably assured. We intend to maintain the valuation allowance until sufficient positive evidence exists to support the reversal of the valuation allowance. Any decision to reverse part or all of the valuation allowance would be based on our estimate of future profitability. If our estimate were to be wrong, we could be required to charge potentially significant amounts to income tax expense to establish a new valuation allowance.
Our effective tax rate includes the impact of certain undistributed foreign earnings for which we partially provided taxes because we plan to reinvest the majority of such earnings indefinitely outside the United States. We plan foreign earnings remittance amounts based on projected cash flow needs as well as the working capital and long-term investment requirements of our foreign subsidiaries and our domestic operations. Material changes in our estimates of cash, working capital and long-term investment requirements in the various jurisdictions in which we do business could impact our effective tax rate. We are subject to income taxes in the United States and certain foreign countries, and we are subject to corporate income tax audits in some of these jurisdictions. We believe that our tax return positions are fully supported, but tax authorities are likely to challenge certain positions, which may not be fully sustained. However, our income tax expense includes amounts intended to satisfy income tax assessments that result from these challenges. Determining the income tax expense for these potential assessments and recording the related assets and liabilities requires management judgments and estimates. We evaluate our uncertain tax positions in accordance with the guidance for accounting for uncertainty in income taxes. We believe that our liability for uncertain tax positions is adequate. We review our liability for uncertain tax positions quarterly, and we may adjust such liability because of proposed assessments by tax authorities, changes in facts and circumstances, issuance of new regulations or new case law, previously unavailable information obtained during the course of an examination, negotiations between tax authorities of different countries concerning our transfer prices, or the expiration of statutes of limitations.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
Refer to Note 1 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a full description of recent accounting pronouncements.","Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
We have operations both within the United States and internationally, and we are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business. These risks primarily include interest rate, foreign exchange and inflation risks, as well as risks relating to changes in the general economic conditions in the countries where we conduct business. To reduce certain of these risks, we monitor the financial condition of our large clients and limit credit exposure by collecting in advance and setting credit limits as we deem appropriate. In addition, our investment strategy has been to invest in financial instruments that are highly liquid and readily convertible into cash. To date, we have not used derivative instruments to mitigate the impact of our market risk exposures. We have also not used, nor do we intend to use, derivatives for trading or speculative purposes.
Interest Rate Risk
We are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates. Our investments primarily consist of money market funds, corporate debt securities, commercial papers, U.S. agency and Treasury securities, and certificates of deposit. As of December 31, 2020, we had cash and cash equivalents of $910.3 million. We didn’t have short-term investments as of December 31, 2020. The primary objectives of our investment activities are the preservation of capital, the fulfillment of liquidity needs and the fiduciary control of cash and investments. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes. Our investments are exposed to market risk due to a fluctuation in interest rates, which may affect our interest income and the fair market value of our investments. Due to the short-term nature of our investment portfolio, we believe only dramatic fluctuations in interest rates would have a material effect on our investments. We do not believe that an immediate 10% increase in interest rates would have a material effect on the fair market value of our portfolio. As such we do not expect our operating results or cash flows to be materially affected by a sudden change in market interest rates.
Foreign Currency Risk
The functional currency for our wholly owned foreign subsidiaries is the U.S. dollar. Accordingly, the subsidiaries remeasure monetary assets and liabilities at period-end exchange rates, while nonmonetary items are remeasured at historical rates. Income and expense accounts are remeasured at the average exchange rates in effect during the year. Remeasurement adjustments are recognized in the consolidated statements of operations as foreign currency transaction gains or losses in the year of occurrence. Aggregate foreign currency transaction losses included in determining net loss were $2.8 million, $1.7 million, and $0.9 million for 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Transaction gains and losses are included in other income (expense), net.
As our international operations grow, our risks associated with fluctuation in currency rates will become greater, and we will continue to reassess our approach to managing this risk. In addition, currency fluctuations or a weakening U.S. dollar can increase the costs of our international expansion. For our operating results and cash flows, we evaluated the effects of a 10% shift in exchange rates between those currencies and the U.S. dollar. We have determined that there would not be a material effect on our results of operations from such a shift. To date, we have not entered into any foreign currency hedging contracts, since exchange rate fluctuations have not had a material impact on our operating results and cash flows. Based on our current international structure, we do not plan on engaging in hedging activities in the near future.
Inflation Risk
We do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Nonetheless, if our costs were to become subject to significant inflationary pressures, we may not be able to fully offset such higher costs through price increases. Our inability or failure to do so could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.","ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Regulations under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or the Exchange Act, require public companies, including us, to maintain “disclosure controls and procedures,” which are defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) to mean a company’s controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2020. Based on their evaluation, as of December 31, 2020, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective.
Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f) and Rule 15d-15(f). Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on its evaluation under the framework in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013), our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2020.
The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears in Item 15(a) of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Changes in Internal Control
There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2020 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. We have not experienced any material impact to our internal control over financial reporting despite the fact that most of our employees are working remotely due to the COVID-19 pandemic. We are continually monitoring and assessing the COVID-19 situation on our internal controls to minimize the impact on their design and operating effectiveness.
Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls
Management does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all error and fraud. Any control system, no matter how well designed and operated, is based upon certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that its objectives will be met. Further, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected.","ITEM 9B.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Proofpoint, Inc.
Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Proofpoint, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the related consolidated statements of operations, of comprehensive loss, of stockholders' equity and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.
Change in Accounting Principle
As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts for leases in 2019 and the manner in which it accounts for revenue from contracts with customers in 2018.
Basis for Opinions
The Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Critical Audit Matters
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.
Revenue - Identifying and evaluating terms and conditions in contracts that impact revenue recognition
As described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, revenue recognition is determined by management through the following steps: 1) identification of the contract, or contracts, with a customer; 2) identification of the performance obligations in the contract; 3) determination of the transaction price; 4) allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and 5) recognition of revenue when, or as, the Company satisfies a performance obligation. Management applies significant judgment in identifying and evaluating any terms and conditions in contracts which may impact revenue recognition. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company’s revenue was $1,050 million.
The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to revenue, specifically identifying and evaluating terms and conditions in contracts that impact revenue recognition, is a critical audit matter are the significant judgment by management in identifying and evaluating terms and conditions in contracts that impact revenue recognition; this in turn led to significant auditor judgment and effort in performing procedures to evaluate whether terms and conditions were appropriately identified and evaluated by management.
Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the revenue recognition process, including controls related to the identification and evaluation of terms and conditions that impact the determination of revenue recognition. These procedures also included, among others, testing the completeness and accuracy of management’s identification and evaluation of the specific terms and conditions in contracts with customers by examining revenue contracts on a test basis and testing management’s process for identifying and evaluating the terms and conditions in contracts, including management’s determination of the impact of those terms and conditions on revenue recognition.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
(dollars and share amounts in thousands, except per share amounts)
1. The Company and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
The Company
Proofpoint, Inc. (the “Company”) was incorporated in Delaware in June 2002 and is headquartered in California.
Proofpoint, Inc. is a leading security-as-a-service provider that enables large and mid-sized organizations worldwide to defend, protect, archive and govern their most sensitive data. The Company’s security-and compliance platform is comprised of an integrated suite of threat protection, information protection, and brand protection solutions, including email protection, advanced threat protection, email authentication, data loss prevention, SaaS application protection, response orchestration and automation, digital risk, web browser isolation, email encryption, archiving, eDiscovery, supervision, secure communication, phishing simulation and security awareness computer-based training.
Basis of Presentation and Consolidation
The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.
During the reporting periods, the Company completed a number of acquisitions which are more fully described in Note 3 “Acquisitions”. The consolidated financial statements include the results of operations from these business combinations from their date of acquisition.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. Significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include those related to revenue recognition, deferred commissions, fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations, impairment assessments of goodwill, intangible assets and other long-lived assets, loss contingencies, stock-based compensation, and income taxes.
Due to the Coronavirus (“COVID-19”) pandemic, there has been uncertainty and disruption in the global economy and financial markets. The Company is not aware of any specific event or circumstance that would require an update to its estimates or judgments or a revision of the carrying value of its assets or liabilities as of December 31, 2020. These estimates may change, as new events occur and additional information is obtained, as well as other factors related to COVID-19 that could result in material impacts to our consolidated financial statements in future reporting periods.
Foreign Currency Remeasurement and Transactions
The functional currency of the Company’s wholly-owned foreign subsidiaries is the U.S. dollar. Accordingly, the subsidiaries remeasure monetary assets and liabilities at period-end exchange rates, while nonmonetary items are remeasured at historical rates. Income and expense accounts are remeasured at the average exchange rates in effect during the year. Remeasurement adjustments are recognized in the consolidated statements of operations as transaction gains or losses within other income, net, in the period of occurrence. Aggregate transaction losses included in determining net loss were $2,847, $1,655 and $943 for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
Proofpoint, Inc.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)
(dollars and share amounts in thousands, except per share amounts)
Cash and Cash Equivalents
The Company considers currency on hand, demand deposits, time deposits, money market funds and all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash and cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents are held in various financial institutions in the United States and internationally.
Investments
The Company classifies all its investments as available-for-sale at the time of purchase since it is management’s intent that these investments be available for current operations, and as such, includes these investments as short-term investments on its balance sheets. These investments consist of money market funds, corporate debt securities, commercial papers, U.S. agency and Treasury securities, and certificates of deposit with original maturities longer than three months. Short-term investments classified as available-for-sale are recorded at fair value with the related unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), a component of stockholders’ equity. Realized gains and losses are recorded in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss based on specific identification.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at lower of cost or net realizable value, with costs computed on a first-in, first-out basis. The Company periodically reviews its inventories for excess and obsolete items and adjusts carrying costs to estimated net realizable values when they are determined to be less than cost. Inventories held at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 consist primarily of finished goods.
Revenue Recognition
Effective January 1, 2018, the Company adopted ASC 606 using the full retrospective method. Refer to Note 2 for a detailed discussion of accounting policies related to revenue recognition, including deferred revenue, deferred commissions and deferred product costs.
Property and Equipment
Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the related asset. Amortization of leasehold improvements is computed using the straight-line method over the shorter of the lease term or the estimated useful life of the asset or improvement. Cost of maintenance and repairs that do not improve or extend the lives of the respective assets are expensed as incurred.
Impairment of Intangible Assets and Other Long-Lived Assets
The Company evaluates long-lived assets, including property, equipment and definitive-lived intangible assets, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of these assets is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of such assets (or asset group) to the future undiscounted cash flows the assets (or asset group) is expected to generate. If the assets are considered to be impaired, the amount of any impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the impaired assets. The Company also evaluates the estimated remaining useful lives of intangible assets and other long-lived assets to assess whether a revision to the remaining periods of amortization is required. No assets were determined to be impaired as of December 31, 2020.
Software Development Costs
Internally developed software includes security software developed to meet the Company’s internal needs to provide cloud-based subscription services to its end-customers and business software that the Company customizes to meet its operating needs. These capitalized costs consist of internal compensation related costs and external direct costs incurred during the application development stage. The costs capitalized were not material in the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.
Proofpoint, Inc.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)
(dollars and share amounts in thousands, except per share amounts)
The costs to develop software that is marketed externally have not been capitalized as the current software development process is essentially completed concurrently with the establishment of technological feasibility. As such, all related software development costs are expensed as incurred and included in research and development expense in the consolidated statements of operations.
Internally and externally developed software is amortized over the software’s estimated useful life of three to six years.
Advertising and Promotion Costs
Expenses related to advertising and promotion of solutions is charged to sales and marketing expense as incurred. The Company did not incur any material advertising and promotion expenses during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.
Goodwill and Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of the acquired enterprise over the fair value of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The Company performs an annual goodwill impairment test during the fourth quarter of a calendar year and more frequently if an event or circumstances indicates that impairment may have occurred. For the purposes of impairment testing, the Company has determined that it has one operating segment and one reporting unit. To test goodwill for impairment, the Company compares the reporting unit’s carrying value with its fair value. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value, then the impairment charge equal to the difference is recorded; however, the loss recognized would not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. The identification and measurement of goodwill impairment involves the estimation of the fair value of the Company. No impairment indicators were identified by the Company as of December 31, 2020.
Intangible assets consist of developed technology, customer relationships, trademarks and patents, order backlog, and in-process research and development asset. The values assigned to intangibles are based on estimates and judgments regarding expectations for success and life cycle of solutions and technologies acquired.
Intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated lives, which approximate the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible assets are consumed, as follows (in years):
Low
High
Developed technology
Customer relationships
Trade names and trademarks
Patents
Order backlog
The in-process research and development asset is not amortized until the associated project is completed.
Warranty
The Company provides limited warranties on all sales and provides for the estimated cost of the warranties at the date of sale, to the extent not already provided by its own vendors. Warranty costs and the accrued warranty liabilities were not material for all periods presented.
Leases
Effective January 1, 2019, the Company adopted ASC 842 using the modified retrospective method. Refer to Note 8 for a detailed discussion of accounting policies related to leases.
Proofpoint, Inc.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)
(dollars and share amounts in thousands, except per share amounts)
Income Taxes
The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with authoritative guidance, which requires use of the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the consolidated financial statements carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which the differences are expected to be reversed.
The Company records net deferred tax assets to the extent the Company believes these assets will more likely than not be realized. In making such determination, the Company considers all available positive and negative evidence, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies and recent financial operations.
The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions within the income tax expense line in the consolidated statements of operations. Accrued interest and penalties are included within the related tax liability line on the consolidated balance sheets.
Research and Development
Research and development expense consists primarily of personnel costs, consulting services, allocated facilities costs and depreciation. Research and development costs are expensed as incurred.
Employee Benefit Plans
The Company’s tax-deferred savings plan is qualified under Section 401(k) of the United States Internal Revenue Code. Employees may make voluntary, tax-deferred contributions to the 401(k) Plan up to the statutorily prescribed annual limit. The Company makes discretionary matching contributions to the 401(k) Plan on behalf of employees up to the limit determined by the Board of Directors. The Company contributed $2,802, $2,816 and $1,563 to the 401(k) Plan in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
Stock-Based Compensation
The Company issues stock-based compensation awards to employees and directors in the form of stock options, restricted stock units (“RSUs”), performance stock units (“PSUs”), employee stock purchase plan (“ESPP”) and stock bonus and other liability awards (collectively, “awards”).
The Company measures and recognizes compensation expense for all stock-based awards based on the awards’ fair value. Stock-based compensation for RSUs is measured based on the value of the Company’s common stock on the grant date. The Company accounts for forfeitures as they occur.
The actual number of PSUs earned and eligible to vest are determined based on the Company’s achievement of the financial and operational performance conditions pre-defined when the awards are granted. The Company recognizes share-based compensation expense for the PSUs on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for each separately vesting portion of the award when it is probable that the performance conditions will be achieved. The Company reassesses the probability of vesting at each reporting period for awards with performance conditions and adjusts stock-based compensation cost based on its probability assessment. The Company recognizes a cumulative catch up adjustment for changes in its probability assessment in subsequent reporting periods.
Stock-based compensation for employee stock options and ESPP awards are measured on the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option pricing model.
Stock bonus and other liability awards are accounted for as liability-classified awards, because the obligations are based predominantly on fixed monetary amounts that are generally known at the inception of the obligation, to be settled with a variable number of shares of the Company’s common stock.
Awards vest either on a graded schedule or in a lump sum. The Company determines the fair value of each award as a single award and recognizes the expense on a straight-line basis over the service period of the award, which is generally the vesting period. The exercise price of stock options granted is equal to the fair value of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant. Stock options expire ten years from the date of grant.

Comprehensive Loss
Comprehensive loss includes all changes in equity that are not the result of transactions with stockholders. The Company’s comprehensive loss consists of its net loss and changes in unrealized gains (losses) from its available-for-sale investments. The Company had no material reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income into net loss in 2020, 2019 and 2018.
Loss Contingencies
The Company may be involved in various lawsuits, claims and proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business. The Company records a provision for a liability when it believes that it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Significant judgment is required to determine both probability and the estimated amount. The Company reviews these provisions at least quarterly and adjusts these provisions to reflect the impact of negotiations, settlements, rulings, and updated information.
Accounting Pronouncements Adopted in 2020
In August 2018, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (""FASB"") issued ASU No. 2018-15, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other-Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40): Customer’s Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement That Is a Service Contract (“ASU 2018-15”). ASU 2018-15 aligns the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract with the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred to develop or obtain internal-use software.
The Company adopted ASU 2018-15 on January 1, 2020 prospectively. The adoption of ASU 2018-15 did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Accounting for Goodwill Impairment (“ASU 2017-04”). ASU 2017-04 removes the requirement to perform a hypothetical purchase price allocation to measure goodwill impairment. A goodwill impairment charge is the amount by which a reporting unit’s carrying value exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill.
The Company adopted ASU 2017-04 on January 1, 2020 prospectively. The adoption of ASU 2017-04 did not have an impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments (“ASU 2016-13”). ASU 2016-13 changes the impairment model for most financial assets, and requires the use of an expected loss model in place of the currently used incurred loss method. Under this model, entities are required to estimate the lifetime expected credit loss on such instruments and record an allowance to offset the amortized cost basis of the financial asset, resulting in a net presentation of the amount expected to be collected on the financial asset.
The Company adopted ASU 2016-13 on January 1, 2020, utilizing the modified retrospective approach. The adoption of ASU 2016-13 did not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements as credit losses are not expected to be significant based on historical collection trends, the financial condition of partners and customers, and external market factors.

In August 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-06, Debt-Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging-Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40) (“ASU 2020-06”). ASU 2020-06 simplifies the accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of liabilities and equity, including convertible instruments and contracts in an entity’s own equity. Among other changes, ASU 2020-06 removes the liability and equity separation model for convertible instruments with a cash conversion feature. As a result, after adoption, entities will no longer separately present in equity an embedded conversion feature for such debt. Similarly, the embedded conversion feature will no longer be amortized as interest expense over the life of the instrument. Instead, entities will account for a convertible debt instrument wholly as debt unless 1) a convertible instrument contains features that require bifurcation as a derivative, or 2) a convertible debt instrument was issued at a substantive premium. Among other potential impacts, ASU 2020-06 will reduce reported interest expense,

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)
(dollars and share amounts in thousands, except per share amounts)
decrease reported net loss, and result in a reclassification of certain conversion feature balance sheet amounts from stockholder’s equity to liabilities as it relates to the Company’s convertible senior notes. Additionally, ASU 2020-06 requires the application of the if-converted method to calculate the impact of convertible instruments on diluted earnings-per-share, which is consistent with the Company’s accounting treatment under the current accounting guidance. ASU 2020-06 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, with early adoption permitted for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, and can be adopted on either a fully retrospective or modified retrospective basis.
The Company expects to adopt ASU 2020-06 effective January 1, 2021 using the full retrospective transition method. The Company expects that adoption of ASU 2020-06 will result in accounting of its senior convertible notes as a single unit of account on the balance sheet, and in a decrease of interest expense and net loss. Upon the adoption of ASU 2020-06, interest expense and net loss for 2020 and 2019 will have been reduced by $30,139 and $10,361, respectively. The Company does not expect the adoption of ASU 2020-06 to have any impact on its cash flows from operating, investing or financing activities.
In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes (“ASU 2019-12”). ASU 2019-12 removes certain exceptions related to the approach for intraperiod tax allocation, the methodology for calculating income taxes in an interim period and the recognition of deferred tax liabilities for outside basis differences. ASU 2019-12 also amends other aspects of the guidance to help simplify and promote consistent application of GAAP. The guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2020, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently assessing the impact that the adoption of ASU 2019-12 will have on its consolidated financial statements.
2. Revenue, Deferred Revenue and Deferred Contract Costs
The core principle of ASC 606 is to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of services or products to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those services or products. The Company applies significant judgment in identifying and evaluating any terms and conditions in contracts which may impact revenue recognition. The principle is achieved through the following five-step approach:
•
Identification of the contract, or contracts, with the customer - The Company considers the terms and conditions of the contract and its customary business practice in identifying its contracts under ASC 606. The Company determines it has a contract with a customer when the contract is approved, the Company can identify each party’s rights regarding the services and products to be transferred, the Company can identify the payment terms for the services and products, the Company has determined the customer has the ability and intent to pay and the contract has commercial substance. At contract inception, the Company evaluates whether two or more contracts should be combined and accounted for as a single contract and whether the combined contract or single contract includes more than one performance obligation. The Company applies judgment in determining the customer’s ability and intent to pay, which is based on a variety of factors, including the customer’s historical payment experience or, in the case of a new customer, credit and financial information pertaining to the customer.
•
Identification of the performance obligation in the contract - Performance obligations promised in a contract are identified based on the services or products that will be transferred to the customer that are both i) capable of being distinct, whereby the customer can benefit from the service or product either on its own or together with other resources that are readily available from third parties or from the Company, and ii) distinct in the context of the contract, whereby the transfer of the services or products is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract. To the extent a contract includes multiple promised services or products, the Company applies judgment to determine whether promised services or products are capable of being distinct and distinct in the context of the contract. If these criteria are not met the promised services or products are accounted for as a combined performance obligation.
•
Determination of the transaction price - The transaction price is determined based on the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring services and products to the customer. Variable consideration is included in the transaction price if, in the Company’s judgment, it
Proofpoint, Inc.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)
(dollars and share amounts in thousands, except per share amounts)
is probable that a significant future reversal of cumulative revenue under the contract will not occur. None of the Company’s contracts contain a significant financing component.
•
Allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract - If the contract contains a single performance obligation, the entire transaction price is allocated to the single performance obligation. Contracts that contain multiple performance obligations require an allocation of the transaction price to each performance obligation based on a relative standalone selling price, or SSP, basis.
•
Recognition of revenue when, or as, the Company satisfies a performance obligation - The Company recognizes revenue when control of the services or products are transferred to the customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those services or products. The Company records its revenue net of any value added or sales tax.
The Company generates sales directly through its sales team and, to a growing extent, through its channel partners. Sales to channel partners are made at a discount and revenues are recorded at this discounted price once all revenue recognition criteria are met. Channel partners generally receive an order from an end-customer prior to placing an order with the Company, and these partners do not carry any inventory of the Company’s products or solutions. Payment from channel partners is not contingent on the partner’s success in sales to end-customers. In the event that the Company offers rebates, joint marketing funds, or other incentive programs to a partner, recorded revenues are reduced by these amounts accordingly.
Payment terms on invoiced amounts are typically 30 to 45 days.
Disaggregation of Revenue
The Company derives its revenue primarily from: (1) subscription service revenue; (2) subscription software revenue, and (3) hardware and services, which include professional service and training revenue provided to customers related to their use of the platform.
The following table presents the Company’s revenue disaggregation:

Subscription service revenue
Subscription service revenue is derived from a subscription-based enterprise licensing model with contract terms typically ranging from one to three years, and consists of (1) subscription fees from the licensing of the Company’s security-as-a-service platform and it’s various components, (2) subscription fees for software with support and related future updates where the software updates are critical to the customers’ ability to derive benefit from the software due to the fast changing nature of the technology. These function together as one performance obligation, and (3) subscription fees for the right to access the Company’s customer support services for software with significant standalone functionality and support services for hardware. The hosted on-demand service arrangements do not provide customers with the right to take possession of the software supporting the hosted services. Support revenue is derived from ongoing security updates, upgrades, bug fixes, and maintenance. A time-elapsed method is used to measure progress because the Company transfers control evenly over the contractual period. Accordingly, the fixed consideration related to subscription service revenue is generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the contract term beginning on the date access is provided, as long as other revenue recognition criteria have been met. Most of the Company’s contracts are non-cancelable over the contract term. Customers typically have the right to terminate their contract for cause if the Company fails to perform in accordance with the contractual terms. Some of the Company’s customers have the option to purchase additional subscription services at a stated price. These options are evaluated on a case-by-case basis but generally do not
Proofpoint, Inc.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)
(dollars and share amounts in thousands, except per share amounts)
provide a material right as they are priced at or above the Company’s SSP and, as such, would not result in a separate performance obligation.
Subscription software revenue
Subscription software revenue is primarily derived from term-based software that is deployed on the customers’ own servers and has significant standalone functionality, is recognized upon transfer of control to the customer. The control for subscription software is transferred at the later of delivery to the customer or the software license start date.
Hardware and services
Hardware revenue consists of amounts derived from the sale of the Company’s on-premise hardware appliance, which is recognized upon passage of control, which occurs upon shipment of the product. Professional services revenue consists of fees associated with consulting, implementation and training services for assisting customers in implementing and expanding the use of the Company’s services and products. These services are distinct from subscription, subscription software licenses and hardware. Professional services do not result in significant customization of the Company’s services and products. The Company recognizes revenue related to the professional services as they are performed.
Contracts with multiple performance obligations
Most of the Company’s contracts with customers contain multiple performance obligations that are distinct and accounted for separately. The transaction price allocated to subscription services and subscription software that does not have significant standalone functionality is determined by considering factors such as historical pricing practices, and the selling price of hardware and professional services is estimated using a cost plus model. The selling price for support of a functional subscription software license is calculated as a percentage of functional subscription software license value which is derived by analyzing internal pricing practice, customer expectations, and industry practice.
Variable consideration
Revenue from sales is recorded at the net sales price, which is the transaction price, and includes estimates of variable consideration. The amount of variable consideration that is included in the transaction price is constrained, and is included in the net sales price only to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of the cumulative revenue will not occur when the uncertainty is resolved. If the Company’s services or products do not meet certain service level commitments, the Company’s customers are entitled to receive service credits representing a form of variable consideration. The Company has not historically experienced any significant incidents affecting the defined levels of reliability and performance as required by the Company’s subscription contracts. Accordingly, any estimated refunds related to these contracts in the consolidated financial statements are not material during the periods presented.
Unbilled accounts receivables
Unbilled accounts receivable represents amounts for which the Company has recognized revenue, pursuant to its revenue recognition policy, for software licenses already delivered and professional services already performed, but billed in arrears and for which the Company believes it has an unconditional right to payment. The unbilled accounts receivable balance, included in accounts receivable in the consolidated balance sheet, was $1,963 and $3,261 as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Deferred commissions
The Company capitalizes sales commissions and associated payroll taxes paid to internal sales personnel, and referral fees paid to independent third-parties, that are incremental to the acquisition of customer contracts. These costs are recorded as deferred commissions on the consolidated balance sheets. The Company determines whether costs should be deferred based on its sales compensation plans, if the commissions are incremental and would not have occurred absent the customer contract. Sales commissions for renewal of a subscription contract are not considered commensurate with the commissions paid for the acquisition of the initial subscription contract given
Proofpoint, Inc.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)
(dollars and share amounts in thousands, except per share amounts)
the substantive difference in commission rate between new and renewal contracts. Commissions paid upon the initial acquisition of a contract are amortized over an estimated period of benefit of five years while commissions paid related to renewal contracts are amortized over a contractual renewal period. Amortization is recognized based on the expected future revenue streams under the customer contracts. Amortization of deferred sales commissions is included in sales and marketing expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. The Company determines the period of benefit for commissions paid for the acquisition of the initial subscription contract by taking into consideration its initial estimated customer life and the technological life of the Company’s software and related significant features. The Company classifies deferred commissions as current or long-term based on the timing of when the Company expects to recognize the expense. The Company periodically reviews these deferred commission costs to determine whether events or changes in circumstances have occurred that could impact the period of benefit of these deferred contract acquisition costs. There were no material impairment losses recorded during the periods presented.
For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, the Company capitalized $91,763, $80,590 and $66,254 of commission costs, respectively, and amortized $62,776, $50,415 and $37,076, respectively.
Deferred product costs
Deferred product costs are the incremental costs to fulfill a contract that are directly associated with each non-cancellable customer contract and primarily consist of royalty payments made to third parties, from whom the Company has obtained licenses to integrate certain software into its products. The deferred product costs are recognized based on the contractual term, and included in cost of revenue in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. The Company classifies deferred product costs as current or long-term based on the timing of when the Company expects to recognize the expense.
For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, the Company capitalized $5,200, $4,727 and $2,765 of deferred product costs, respectively, and amortized $4,605, $3,531 and $2,463, respectively.
Deferred revenue
The Company records deferred revenue when cash payments are received, or invoices are issued in advance of the Company’s performance, and generally recognizes revenue over the contractual term. The Company recognized revenue of $608,880, $490,172 and $363,483 during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, that was included in the deferred revenue balances at the beginning of the respective periods.
The Company recognized $1,736, $1,906 and $2,901 of revenue during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, related to the performance obligations satisfied in prior periods. The acquisition of ObserveIT, Ltd. (see Note 3 “Acquisitions”) on November 25, 2019, increased deferred revenue by $6,700, of which $681 was recognized in the year ended December 31, 2019.
Remaining performance obligations
Contracted revenue as of December 31, 2020 that has not yet been recognized (“contracted not recognized”) was $817,949, which includes deferred revenue and non-cancellable amounts that will be invoiced and recognized as revenue in future periods and excludes contracts with an original expected length of one year or less. The Company expects 58% of contracted and not recognized revenue to be recognized over the next twelve months, 40% in years two and three, with the remaining balance recognized thereafter.

3. Acquisitions
Acquisitions are accounted for under the purchase method of accounting in which the tangible and identifiable intangible assets and liabilities of each acquired company are recorded at their respective fair values as of each acquisition date, including an amount for goodwill representing the difference between the respective acquisition consideration and fair values of identifiable net assets. The Company believes that for the acquisitions described below, the combined entities will achieve savings in corporate overhead costs and opportunities for growth through expanded geographic and customer segment diversity with the ability to leverage additional products and capabilities. These factors, among others, contributed to purchase prices in excess of the estimated fair values of the acquired companies’ net identifiable assets acquired and, as a result, goodwill was recorded in connection with the acquisitions. Goodwill related to the acquisitions of The Defence Works Limited, ObserveIT, Ltd. and Meta Networks, Ltd. is deductible for tax purposes, and goodwill related to the acquisition of Wombat Security Technologies, Inc. is not deductible for tax purposes.
While the Company uses its best estimates and assumptions as part of the purchase price allocation process to value assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date, these estimates and assumptions are subject to refinement. When additional information becomes available, such as finalization of negotiations of working capital adjustments and tax related matters, the Company may revise its preliminary purchase price allocation. As a result, during the preliminary purchase price allocation period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, the Company may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Subsequent to the purchase price allocation period, adjustments to assets acquired or liabilities assumed are recognized in the operating results.
2020 Acquisition
The Defence Works Limited
On May 5, 2020, the Company completed its acquisition of The Defence Works Limited. The acquisition brings a library of interactive content to the Company’s security awareness training portfolio and provides the Company’s customers innovative content to support their security education programs. The total consideration was $2,767, of which $766 was allocated to goodwill and $2,400 was allocated to intangible assets. The acquired intangible assets consist of content library which is included within the developed technology assets in Note 6 “Goodwill and Intangible Assets.” The impact of the acquisition was not material to the Company’s Consolidated financial statements in 2020.
2019 Acquisitions
ObserveIT, Ltd.
On November 25, 2019 (the “ObserveIT Acquisition Date”), pursuant to the terms of the share purchase agreement, the Company acquired all shares of ObserveIT, Ltd. (“ObserveIT”). ObserveIT provides detection and prevention from insider threats solutions including data loss detection and response, user activity monitoring, incident response and compliance.
By combining ObserveIT’s endpoint agent technology and data risk analytics with the Company’s information classification, threat detection and intelligence, the Company has an insight into user activity with their sensitive data, wherever it resides, and the ability to immediately remediate risk.
These factors, among others, contributed to a purchase price in excess of the estimated fair value of acquired net identifiable assets and, as a result, goodwill was recorded in connection with the acquisition. The results of operations and the fair values of the acquired assets and liabilities assumed have been included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements since the ObserveIT Acquisition Date.
At the ObserveIT Acquisition Date, the consideration transferred was $213,747, net of cash acquired of $4,752. Of the consideration transferred, $3,250 was held in escrow to secure indemnification obligations.
Per the terms of the share purchase agreement, unvested stock options held by ObserveIT employees were canceled and exchanged for the Company’s unvested stock options. The fair value of $446 of these unvested awards

was attributed to pre-combination services and was included in consideration transferred. The fair value of $5,427 was allocated to post-combination services. The unvested awards are subject to the recipient’s continued service with the Company and $5,427 is recognized ratably as stock-based compensation expense over the required remaining service period.
Also, as part of the share purchase agreement, the unvested restricted shares of a certain employee of ObserveIT were exchanged into the right to receive $532 of deferred cash consideration. The unpaid deferred cash consideration was presented as restricted cash on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019. The deferred cash consideration of $485 was allocated to post-combination expense and was not included in the purchase price. The deferred cash consideration is subject to forfeiture if employment terminates prior to the lapse of the restrictions, and the fair value is expensed as compensation expense over the three-year vesting period.
The Discounted Cash Flow Method was used to value the acquired developed technology, in-process research and development asset, customer relationships and order backlog. The Relief from Royalty Method was used to value the acquired trade name. Management applied significant judgment in estimating the fair values of these intangible assets, which involved the use of significant assumptions with respect to forecasted revenue, forecasted operating results and discount rates.

Meta Networks, Ltd.
On May 15, 2019 (the “Meta Networks Acquisition Date”), pursuant to the terms of the share purchase agreement, the Company acquired all shares of Meta Networks, Ltd. (“Meta Networks”), an innovator in zero trust network access.
By combining Meta Networks’ innovative zero trust network access technology with the Company’s people-centric security capabilities the Company made it simpler for enterprises to precisely control employee and contractor access to on-premises, cloud and consumer applications.
These factors, among others, contributed to a purchase price in excess of the estimated fair value of acquired net identifiable assets and, as a result, goodwill was recorded in connection with the acquisition. The results of operations and the fair values of the acquired assets and liabilities assumed have been included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements since the Meta Networks Acquisition Date.

At the Meta Networks Acquisition Date, the consideration transferred was $104,664, net of cash acquired of $104. Of the consideration transferred, $12,500 was held in escrow to secure indemnification obligations.
Per the terms of the share purchase agreement, unvested stock options and unvested restricted stock units held by Meta Networks employees were canceled and exchanged for the Company’s unvested stock options and unvested restricted stock units, respectively. The fair value of $184 of these unvested awards was attributed to pre-combination services and was included in consideration transferred. The fair value of $12,918 was allocated to post-combination services. The unvested awards are subject to the recipient’s continued service with the Company, and $12,918 is recognized ratably as stock-based compensation expense over the required remaining service period.
Also, as part of the share purchase agreement, the unvested restricted shares of certain employees of Meta Networks were exchanged into the right to receive $7,827 of deferred cash consideration and 72 shares of the Company’s common stock that were deferred with the fair value of $8,599. The unpaid deferred cash consideration was presented as restricted cash on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019. The deferred cash consideration of $7,596 and the deferred stock of $8,338 (see Note 11 “Stockholders’ Equity”) were allocated to post-combination expense and were not included in the purchase price. The deferred cash consideration and deferred shares are subject to forfeiture if employment terminates prior to the lapse of the restrictions, and their fair value is expensed as compensation and stock-based compensation expense over the three-year vesting period.
The Cost to Recreate Method was used to value the acquired developed technology asset. Management applied judgment in estimating the fair value of this intangible asset, which involved the use of significant assumptions such as the cost and time to build the acquired technology, developer’s profit and rate of return.

2018 Acquisition
Wombat Security Technologies, Inc.
On February 28, 2018 (the “Wombat Acquisition Date”), pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, the Company acquired all shares of Wombat Security Technologies, Inc. (“Wombat”), a leader for phishing simulation and security awareness computer-based training. By collecting data from Wombat’s PhishAlarm solution, the Company has access to data on phishing campaigns as seen by non-Company customers, providing broader visibility and insight to the Proofpoint Nexus platform.
With this acquisition, the Company’s customers can leverage the industry’s first solution combining the Company’s advanced threat protection with Wombat’s phishing simulation and computer-based security awareness training. With the combined solutions, the Company’s customers can:
•
use real detected phishing attacks for simulations, assessing users based on the threats that are actually targeting them;
•
both investigate and take action on user-reporting phishing, leveraging orchestration and automation to find real attacks, quarantine emails in users’ inboxes, and lock user accounts to limit risk; and
•
train users in the moment immediately after they click for both simulated and real phishing attacks.

The Company also achieved savings in corporate overhead costs for the combined entities. These factors, among others, contributed to a purchase price in excess of the estimated fair value of acquired net identifiable assets and, as a result, goodwill was recorded in connection with the acquisition.
At the Wombat Acquisition Date, the consideration transferred was $225,366, net of cash acquired of $13,452.
Per the terms of the merger agreement, unvested in-the-money stock options held by Wombat employees were canceled and paid off using the same amount per option as for the common share less applicable exercise price for each option. The fair value of $1,580 of these unvested options was attributed to pre-combination service and included in consideration transferred. The fair value of unvested options of $1,571 was allocated to post-combination services and expensed in the three months ended March 31, 2018. Also, as part of the merger agreement, 51 shares of the Company’s common stock were deferred for certain key employees with the total fair value of $5,458 (see Note 11 “Stockholders’ Equity”), which was not included in the purchase price. The deferred shares are subject to forfeiture if employment terminates prior to the lapse of the restrictions, and their fair value is expensed as stock-based compensation expense over the remaining service period.

4. Concentration of Risks
Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to credit risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and accounts receivable.
The Company limits its concentration of risk in cash equivalents and short-term investments by diversifying its investments among a variety of industries and issuers and by limiting the average maturity to one year or less. The Company’s professional portfolio managers adhere to this investment policy as approved by the Company’s Board of Directors.
The Company’s investment policy is to invest only in fixed income investments denominated and payable in U.S. dollars. Investment in obligations of the U.S. government and its agencies, money market instruments, commercial paper, certificates of deposit, bankers’ acceptances, corporate bonds of U.S. companies, municipal securities and asset backed securities are allowed. The Company does not invest in auction rate securities, futures contracts, or hedging instruments.
The Company’s accounts receivables are derived from revenue earned from customers primarily located in the United States of America. The Company performs periodic evaluations of its customers’ financial condition and generally does not require its customers to provide collateral or other security to support accounts receivable, and maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts. Credit losses historically have not been material.

7. Fair Value Measurements and Investments
Fair Value Measurements
Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (i.e., the “exit price”) in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. A hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value has been defined to minimize the use of unobservable inputs by requiring the use of observable market data when available. Observable inputs are inputs that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on active market data. Unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect the Company’s assumptions about the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on the best information available in the circumstances.
Proofpoint, Inc.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)
(dollars and share amounts in thousands, except per share amounts)
The fair value hierarchy prioritizes the inputs into three broad levels:
•
Level 1: Quoted (unadjusted) prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. The Company’s Level 1 assets generally consist of money market funds.
•
Level 2: Observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the asset or liability. The Company’s Level 2 assets and liabilities generally consist of corporate debt securities, commercial papers, U.S. agency and Treasury securities and convertible senior notes.
•
Level 3: Unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the measurement of the fair value of the assets or liabilities. Level 3 assets and liabilities include those whose fair value measurements are determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies or similar valuation techniques, as well as significant management judgment or estimation.
The following tables summarize, for each category of assets or liabilities carried at fair value, the respective fair value as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 and the classification by level of input within the fair value hierarchy:

Based on quoted market prices as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, the fair value of the 2024 Notes (see Note 10 “Convertible Senior Notes” to the Consolidated Financial Statements) was approximately $1,021,200 and $951,050, respectively, determined using Level 2 inputs as they are not actively traded in markets.

As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, all investments mature in less than one year. Fair values for marketable securities are based on quoted market prices for the same or similar instruments.
The Company reviews its investments on a quarterly basis to identify and evaluate investments that have an indication of possible impairment and has determined that no other-than-temporary impairments were required to be recognized during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.
8. Leases
The Company determines if an arrangement is, or contains, a lease at inception. Operating leases are included in operating right-of-use (“ROU”) assets and operating lease liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. The Company does not separate non-lease components from lease components for its real estate and data center leases and instead account for each separate lease component, and non-lease components associated with that lease component, as a single lease component. The Company does not recognize right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for short-term leases, which have a lease term of twelve months or less.
The Company adopted ASC 842 in the first quarter of 2019, utilizing the modified retrospective transition method through a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening accumulated deficit as of January 1, 2019.
ROU assets represent the Company’s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term, and lease liabilities represent the Company’s obligation to make lease payments based on the lease contracts. Operating lease ROU assets and liabilities were recognized at adoption date, or lease commencement date if the commencement date was after January 1, 2019, based on the present value of lease payments over the remaining lease term. The Company’s lease contracts do not provide an implicit rate, as such the Company used its incremental borrowing rate based on
Proofpoint, Inc.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)
(dollars and share amounts in thousands, except per share amounts)
the information available at adoption date, or lease commencement date if the commencement date was after January 1, 2019, in determining the present value of lease payments. The operating lease ROU assets also includes any lease payments made to the lessors at or before the lease commencement date, and excludes lease incentives. The lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise that option. Lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
The Company has operating leases for corporate offices, research and development facilities, sales and marketing offices and data centers.
The Company’s real estate leases have remaining lease terms for up to eleven years, some of which include options to extend the lease period up to ten years. The data center leases have remaining lease terms of up to three years, some of which have renewal periods of one year.
In October 2018, the Company entered into a 127-month lease agreement to lease approximately 242,400 square feet of corporate office space in Sunnyvale, California, which became the Company’s new corporate headquarters in November 2020, after the construction of the property by the landlord was completed and the lease commenced. The lease contains a rent holiday period, scheduled rent increases, lease incentives, and renewal option which allow the lease term to be extended by five years. Base rental payments will be approximately $160,178 over the lease term.

9. Commitments and Contingencies
Purchase Commitments
As of December 31, 2020, the Company’s minimum purchase commitments for products and services were $57,217, of which $16,411 represent long-term purchase commitments through the year ending December 31, 2025.
Contingencies
Under the indemnification provisions of the Company’s customer agreements, the Company agrees to indemnify and defend and hold harmless its customers against, among other things, infringement of any patent, trademark or copyright under any country’s laws or the misappropriation of any trade secret arising from the customers’ legal use of the Company’s solutions. The exposure to the Company under these indemnification provisions is generally limited to the total amount paid by the customers under the applicable customer agreement. However, certain indemnification provisions potentially expose the Company to losses in excess of the aggregate amount paid to the Company by the customer under the applicable customer agreement. To date, there have been no claims against the Company or its customers pursuant to these indemnification provisions.
Legal Contingencies
From time to time, the Company may be involved in legal proceedings and subject to claims in the ordinary course of business. For lawsuits where the Company is the defendant, the Company is in the process of defending these litigation matters, and while there can be no assurances and the outcomes of these matters are currently not determinable, the Company currently believes that there are no existing claims or proceedings that are likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
10. Convertible Senior Notes
0.25% Convertible Senior Notes due 2024
On August 23, 2019, the Company issued $920,000 aggregate principal amount of 0.25% Convertible Senior Notes due 2024 (the “2024 Notes”). The offering represented $800,000 aggregate principal amount of the 2024 Notes plus the full exercise of the initial buyers’ option to purchase up to an additional $120,000 aggregate principal amount. The net proceeds after the agent’s discount and issuance costs of $19,065 from the 2024 Notes offering were approximately $900,935. The Company used $84,871 of the net proceeds from the offering to pay the cost of the capped call transactions described below. The Company expects to use the remaining net proceeds for general corporate purposes, which may include acquisitions or other strategic transactions. The 2024 Notes are senior unsecured, unsubordinated obligations of the Company. The 2024 Notes bear interest at 0.25% per year, payable semi-annually in arrears every February 15 and August 15, beginning on February 15, 2020. The 2024 Notes mature on August 15, 2024, unless repurchased, redeemed or converted in accordance with their terms prior to such date.
The initial conversion rate is 6.4941 shares of the Company’s common stock per $1 principal amount of the 2024 Notes, which equates to an initial conversion price of $153.99 per share of common stock. Throughout the term of the 2024 Notes, the conversion rate may be adjusted upon the occurrence of certain events.
At the Company’s option, on or after August 20, 2022, the Company will be able to redeem all or a portion of the 2024 Notes at 100% of the principal amount, plus any accrued and unpaid interest, under certain conditions. The Company may redeem the 2024 Notes in shares of the Company’s common stock, cash, or some combination of each.
Prior to April 15, 2024, the 2024 Notes will be convertible at the option of the holders only upon the satisfaction of certain conditions and during certain periods upon the following circumstances:
•
during any calendar quarter commencing after December 31, 2019, if the last reported sale price of the Company’s common stock for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during the period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on, and including, the last trading day of the preceding calendar quarter is greater than or equal to 130% of the applicable conversion price on each such trading day;
Proofpoint, Inc.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)
(dollars and share amounts in thousands, except per share amounts)
•
during the five business day period after any five consecutive trading day period in which the trading price per $1 principal amount of the 2024 Notes for each trading day of that five day consecutive trading day period was less than 98% of the product of the last reported sale price of the Company’s common stock and the applicable conversion rate on each such trading day;
•
upon a notice of redemption in which case, the Company will increase the conversion rate for the 2024 Notes so surrendered for conversion in connection with such redemption notice in accordance with the indenture; or
•
upon the occurrence of specified corporate transactions, as described in the indenture.
On or after April 15, 2024, holders may convert their 2024 Notes at the applicable conversion rate at any time prior to the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date.
Holders of the 2024 Notes also have the right to require the Company to repurchase all or a portion of the 2024 Notes at 100% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, upon the occurrence of certain fundamental changes to the Company.
In accounting for the issuance of the 2024 Notes, the Company separated the 2024 Notes into liability and equity components. The carrying amount of the liability component was calculated by measuring the fair value of similar liabilities that do not have associated convertible features. The carrying amount of the equity component representing the conversion option was determined by deducting the fair value of the liability component from the principal amount of the 2024 Notes. The Company bifurcated the conversion option of the 2024 Notes from the debt instrument, classified the conversion option in equity and accretes the resulting debt discount as interest expense over the contractual term of the 2024 Notes using the effective interest rate method. The equity component is not remeasured while the 2024 Notes continue to meet the conditions for equity classification. Upon issuance of the 2024 Notes, after allocation of debt discount and issuance costs, the Company recorded $737,912 as debt and $163,023 as additional paid in capital within stockholders’ equity.
The effective interest rate of the liability component of the 2024 Notes is 4.76%. This interest rate was based on the interest rates of similar liabilities held by other companies with similar credit risk ratings at the time of issuance that did not have associated convertible features.
The debt discount and issuance costs were allocated based on the total amount incurred to the liability and equity components using the same proportions as the proceeds from the 2024 Notes. The equity issuance costs of $3,450 were recorded as a decrease to additional paid-in capital at the issuance date.
The following table represents the carrying value of the 2024 Notes as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019:

Capped Calls
In connection with the issuance of the 2024 Notes, including the initial purchasers’ exercise of the option to purchase additional 2024 Notes, the Company entered into privately negotiated capped call transactions with certain counterparties (the “Capped Calls”). The Capped Calls are expected to reduce potential dilution to the Company’s common stock upon conversion of the 2024 Notes and/or offset any cash payments that the Company is required to make in excess of the principal amount of the converted 2024 Notes, as the case may be, with such reduction and/or offset subject to a cap. The Capped Calls have a cap price equal to $223.98 per share, subject to certain adjustments, and expire on August 15, 2024. The Capped Calls are subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified extraordinary events affecting the Company, including merger events, tender offers and announcement events. In addition, the Capped Calls are subject to certain specified additional disruption events that may give rise to a termination of the Capped Calls, including nationalization, insolvency or delisting, changes in law, failures to deliver, insolvency filings and hedging disruptions.
For accounting purposes, the Capped Calls are separate transactions, and not part of the terms of the 2024 Notes. As these transactions meet certain accounting criteria, the Capped Calls are recorded in stockholders’ equity and are not accounted for as derivatives. The premium paid for the purchase of the Capped Calls in the amount of $83,720 and related issuance cost of $1,151 have been recorded as a reduction to additional paid-in capital and will not be remeasured.
0.75% Convertible Senior Notes
On June 17, 2015, the Company issued $200,000 principal amount of 0.75% Convertible Senior Notes (the “2020 Notes”) due 2020 in a private offering to qualified institutional buyers (“Holders”) pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1934, as amended (the “Securities Act”). The initial Holders of the 2020 Notes also had an option to purchase an additional $30,000 in principal amount which was exercised in full. The net proceeds after the agent’s discount and issuance costs of $6,581 from the 2020 Notes offering were approximately $223,419. The Company used the net proceeds for working capital and general corporate purposes, which included funding the Company’s operations, capital expenditures, and acquisitions of businesses, products or technologies. The 2020 Notes bore interest at 0.75% per year, payable semi-annually in arrears every June 15 and December 15, beginning on December 15, 2015.
During the quarter ended September 30, 2018, $229,869 of the principal amount of the 2020 Notes was converted into 2,928 shares of common stock, with the remaining $142 repaid in cash. The shares of common stock had a fair value of $336,994 at the time of the conversion. This transaction resulted in a $7,207 loss on extinguishment that was included in interest expense in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. The loss on extinguishment was calculated as the difference between the fair value amount allocated to the liability component on the date of conversion and net carrying amount of the liability component.
For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, the Company incurred the following interest expense and loss on conversion related to the Notes:

11. Stockholders’ Equity
Stock-Based Compensation Plans
On March 30, 2012, the Company’s Board of Directors (the “Board of Directors”) and the Company’s stockholders approved the 2012 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2012 Plan”), which became effective in April 2012. The 2012 Plan was amended, effective June 2019, when the Company’s stockholders approved an Amended and Restated 2012 Equity Incentive Plan (the “Amended 2012 Plan”) at the annual meeting of the stockholders on June 6, 2019. The Company has eight equity incentive plans: the Company’s 2002 stock option plan (the “2002 Plan”), the 2012 Plan and six plans assumed by the Company upon various business acquisitions. The assumed plans are the Cloudmark, Inc. plan, the WebLife Balance, Inc. plan, the Meta Networks, Ltd. plan, the ObserveIT, Ltd. plan, and two FireLayers, Ltd. (“FireLayers”) plans. Upon the Company’s initial public offering, all shares that were reserved under the 2002 Plan but not issued, and shares issued but subsequently returned to the plan through forfeitures, cancellations and repurchases became part of the 2012 Plan and no further shares will be granted pursuant to the 2002 Plan. No further shares will be granted pursuant to the assumed plans. All outstanding stock awards under the 2002 Plan, the assumed plans and Amended 2012 Plan will continue to be governed by their existing terms. Under the Amended 2012 Plan, the Company has the ability to issue incentive stock options (“ISOs”), nonstatutory stock options (“NSOs”), restricted stock awards, stock bonus awards, stock appreciation rights (“SARs”), restricted stock units (“RSUs”), and performance stock units (“PSUs”). The Amended 2012 Plan also allows direct issuance of common stock to employees, outside directors and consultants at prices equal to the fair market value at the date of grant of options or issuance of common stock. Additionally, the Amended 2012 Plan provides for the grant of performance cash awards to employees, directors and consultants. The Company has the right to repurchase any unvested shares (at the option exercise price) of common stock issued directly or under option exercises. The right of repurchase generally expires over the vesting period.
Stock bonus and other liability awards are accounted for as liability-classified awards, because the obligations are based predominantly on fixed monetary amounts that are generally known at the inception of the obligation, to be settled with a variable number of shares of the Company’s common stock.
Under the equity incentive plans, the term of an option grant shall not exceed ten years from the date of its grant and options generally vest over a three to four-year period, with vesting on a monthly or annual interval. Under the 2002 Plan and the Amended 2012 Plan, 32,759 shares of common stock are reserved for issuance to eligible participants. As of December 31, 2020, 6,575 shares were available for future grant. Restricted stock awards generally vest over a three to five -year period.
The Company net-share settles equity awards held by employees by withholding shares upon vesting to satisfy tax withholding obligations. The shares withheld to satisfy employee tax withholding obligations are returned to the Company’s Amended 2012 Plan and will be available for future issuance. Payments for employee’s tax obligations to the tax authorities are recognized as a reduction to additional paid-in capital and reflected as financing activities in the Company’s consolidated statements of cash flows.
Stock Options
The fair value of options granted is estimated on the grant date using the Black-Scholes option valuation model. This valuation model for stock-based compensation expense requires the Company to make assumptions and judgments about the variables used in the calculation, including the expected term (weighted-average period of time that the options granted are expected to be outstanding), the volatility of the common stock price and the assumed risk-free interest rate. The Company accounts for forfeitures as they occur.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan
On March 30, 2012, the Board of Directors and the Company’s stockholders approved the 2012 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the “ESPP”), which became effective in April 2012. A total of 745 shares of the Company’s common stock were initially reserved for future issuance under the ESPP. The number of shares reserved for issuance under the ESPP will increase automatically on January 1 of each of the first eight years commencing with 2013 by the number of shares equal to 1% of the Company’s shares outstanding on the immediately preceding December 31, but not to exceed 1,490 shares, unless the Board of Directors, in its discretion, determines to make a

smaller increase. As of December 31, 2020, there were 2,410 shares of the Company’s common stock available for future issuance under the ESPP.
The fair value of the option component of the ESPP shares was estimated at the grant date using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions:

Share Repurchase Program
On August 27, 2020, the board of directors approved a share repurchase program under which the Company is authorized to repurchase up to $300,000 of the Company’s common stock (the “Repurchase Program”). Repurchases under the Repurchase Program may be made through open market purchases (including through trading plans administered under pre-determined purchasing criteria), block trades and/or privately negotiated transactions, subject to market conditions, applicable legal requirements, and other relevant factors. The timing, volume and nature of the repurchases are at the discretion of management, based on its evaluation of the capital needs of the Company, market conditions, applicable legal requirements and other factors. The Repurchase Program
Proofpoint, Inc.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)
(dollars and share amounts in thousands, except per share amounts)
does not have an expiration date and may be suspended or discontinued by the Company at any time without prior notice.
During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company repurchased 1,335 shares of common stock under the Repurchase Program in open market transactions at an average price of $104.42 per share, for an aggregate purchase price of $139,356. As of December 31, 2020, $160,644 remained available for future share repurchases under the Repurchase Program.
12. Net Loss per Share
Basic net loss per share of common stock is calculated by dividing the net loss by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the period. The weighted-average number of shares of common stock used to calculate basic net loss per share of common stock excludes those shares subject to repurchase related to stock options or restricted stock that were exercised or issued prior to vesting as these shares are not deemed to be issued for accounting purposes until they vest. Diluted net loss per share of common stock is computed by dividing the net loss using the weighted-average number of shares of common stock, excluding common stock subject to repurchase, and, if dilutive, potential shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Basic and diluted net loss per common share was the same for all periods presented as the impact of all potentially dilutive securities outstanding was anti-dilutive.
The following table presents the potentially dilutive common shares outstanding that were excluded from the computation of diluted net loss per share of common stock for the periods presented because including them would have been anti-dilutive:

13. Segment Reporting
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting supported and defined by the components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is available, provided and is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. The Company’s chief operating decision maker is its Chief Executive Officer. The Company’s Chief Executive Officer reviews financial information presented on a consolidated basis. The Company has one business activity, and there are no segment managers who are held accountable for operations, operating results and plans for levels or components below the consolidated unit level. Accordingly, the Company determined that it has one operating and reportable segment.

evidence, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies and recent financial operations.
Realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon future earnings, if any, the timing and amount of which are uncertain. The valuation allowance increased by $50,197, $1,313 and $41,521 during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The change in valuation allowance for the year ended December 31, 2018, included an increase of $3,392 related to the 2020 Notes conversion. The change in valuation allowance for the year ended December 31, 2019, included a decrease of $44,855 related to the 2024 Notes issued in August 2019.
During the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, the Company recorded a current and deferred tax expense of $27,106 and $17,670, respectively, related to the transfer of certain intellectual property rights from its wholly owned subsidiaries in Israel. During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company recorded a deferred tax benefit of $14,725 related to changes in the Company’s valuation allowance resulting from the Wombat business acquisition.
As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company had net operating loss carry-forwards for federal income tax purposes of $887,601 and $841,970, respectively. The federal net operating losses generated prior to tax year beginning in 2018 and which are subject to expiration will expire between 2021 and 2037. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company had federal research credit carry-forwards of $48,867 and $37,783 respectively. The federal research and development credits will begin to expire in 2022.
As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company had net operating loss carry-forwards for state income tax purposes of approximately $431,531 and $417,505, respectively. The state net operating losses will continue to expire between 2021 and 2039. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company had research and development credit carry-forwards for state income tax purpose of $37,879 and $32,291, respectively. The state research and development credits have no expiration period.
As of December 31, 2020, the Company had no net operating losses carry-forwards in non-U.S. locations. As of December 31, 2019, the Company had net operating losses carry-forwards in non-U.S. locations of approximately $52,851. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company had research and development credit carry-forwards in its non-U.S. locations of approximately $3,119 and $2,863, respectively. The non-U.S. research and development credits will begin to expire in 2032.
Utilization of the federal and state net operating losses may be subject to substantial annual limitation due to the ownership change limitations provided by the Internal Revenue Code and similar state provisions. Analyses have been conducted to determine whether an ownership change had occurred since inception. The analyses have indicated that although ownership changes have occurred in prior years, the net operating losses and research and development credits would not expire before utilization as a result of the ownership change. In the event the Company has subsequent changes in ownership, net operating losses and research and development credit carryovers could be limited and may expire unutilized as a result of the subsequent ownership change.
The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions within the income tax expense line in the consolidated statements of operations. Accrued interest and penalties are included within the related tax liability line in the consolidated balance sheets. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company increased income tax expense by $1,303 from interest and penalties related to tax contingencies and has $1,981 of interest and penalties recorded as a long-term income tax liability. December 31, 2019, the Company increased income tax expense by $368 from interest and penalties related to tax contingencies and has $677 of interest and penalties recorded as a long-term income tax liability. During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company reduced income tax benefit by $21 from interest and penalties related to tax contingencies and has $309 of interest and penalties recorded as a long-term income tax liability as of December 31, 2018.
As of December 31, 2020, the Company had recorded unrecognized tax benefits of $35,066 that if recognized, would benefit the Company’s effective tax rate. As of December 31, 2019, the Company had recorded unrecognized tax benefits of $16,068 that, if recognized, would benefit the Company’s effective tax rate.

The Company is currently under audit by the Israel Tax Authority for tax years 2016 through 2018. Related to the audit by the Israel Tax Authority it is reasonably possible that the Company’s uncertain tax positions could change within the next 12 months. An estimate of the range of any change cannot be made. The Company believes it has recorded all appropriate provisions for all jurisdictions and open years. However, the Company can give no assurance that taxing authorities will not propose adjustments that would increase its tax liabilities. The Company is not currently under audit by the IRS or any similar taxing authority in any other material jurisdiction.
Because of net operating loss and credit carry-forwards, all of the Company’s tax years dating to inception in 2002 remain open to tax examination in U.S. and certain state tax jurisdictions. For other major non-U.S. jurisdictions, tax years from 2012 to present remain open to tax examination. The Company is not currently under audit in any material jurisdictions.

BUSINESS
Overview
Workday is a leading provider of enterprise cloud applications for finance and human resources, helping customers adapt and thrive in a changing world. Workday provides more than 8,000 organizations with software-as-a-service solutions to help solve some of today’s most complex business challenges, including supporting and empowering their workforce, managing their finances and spend in an ever-changing environment, and planning for the unexpected.
Our purpose is to inspire a brighter work day for all. We strive to make the world of work and business better, and hope to empower customers to do the same through an innovative suite of solutions adopted by thousands of organizations around the world and across industries - from medium-sized businesses to more than 45 percent of the Fortune 500. Central to our purpose is a set of core values - with our employees as number one - followed by customer service, innovation, integrity, fun, and profitability. We believe that having happy employees leads to happy customers, and we are committed to helping our customers drive their digital transformations in this increasingly dynamic business environment.
As organizations adapt to changing conditions, we believe the need for an intuitive, scalable, and secure platform that ties finance, people, suppliers, and plans together in one version of truth is more important than ever. Workday provides organizations with a unified system that can help them plan, execute, analyze, and extend to other applications and environments, thereby helping them continuously adapt how they manage their businesses. To support this, Workday delivers weekly product updates in addition to major feature releases twice a year. Through this model, Workday customers are able to stay current as one Workday community all on the same version of software that features a unified data and security model and rich user experience. We sell our solutions worldwide primarily through direct sales. We also offer professional services, both directly and through our Workday Services Partners, to help customers deploy our solutions.
To grow our unified suite of Workday applications, we primarily invest in research and development, but we also selectively acquire companies that are consistent with our design principles, existing product set, corporate strategy, and company culture. We acquired Adaptive Insights, a business planning company, in fiscal 2019; Scout RFP (“Scout”), a strategic sourcing company, in fiscal 2020; and we recently announced our intent to acquire Peakon ApS (“Peakon”), an employee success platform that converts feedback into actionable insights, in fiscal 2022.
Our Capabilities
Workday’s suite of enterprise cloud applications addresses the evolving needs of the chief financial officer (“CFO”), chief human resources officer (“CHRO”), and chief information officer (“CIO”) across various industries. Workday applications for Financial Management, Spend Management, Human Capital Management (“HCM”), Planning, and Analytics and Benchmarking can also be extended to other applications and environments through the Workday Cloud Platform.
Financial Management: Solutions for the Office of the CFO
In the changing world of finance, Workday helps finance leaders accelerate their journeys towards becoming a truly digital finance operation by giving them the tools they need to manage the strategic direction of their companies while also supporting growth, profitability, and compliance and regulatory requirements. Workday’s suite of financial management applications helps enable CFOs to maintain accounting information in the general ledger; manage core financial processes such as payables and receivables; identify real-time financial, operational, and management insights; improve financial consolidation; reduce time-to-close; promote internal control and auditability; and achieve consistency across global finance operations.
Spend Management: Solutions for the Office of the CFO
As businesses adapt to changing conditions, Workday provides procurement professionals with tools to support them through the source-to-contract process, such as a user experience designed for ease and collaboration. Workday offers a set of cloud spend management solutions that help companies streamline supplier selection and contracts, manage indirect spend, and build and execute sourcing events, such as requests for proposals.
Human Capital Management: Solutions for the Office of the CHRO
In the changing world of human resources (“HR”), Workday helps companies identify and respond to rapidly changing conditions, whether they stem from shifting talent needs or a renewed focus on belonging and diversity. Workday’s suite of HCM applications allows organizations to manage the entire employee lifecycle - from recruitment to retirement - enabling HR teams to hire, onboard, pay, develop and reskill, and provide meaningful employee experiences that are personalized, helpful, and meet the diverse needs of today’s workforce.
Planning: Solutions for the Offices of the CFO and CHRO
In today’s dynamic business environment, businesses are continuously planning to model various scenarios and prepare to quickly respond to change. Workday provides an active planning process that can model across finance, workforce, sales, and operational data, helping companies make more informed decisions and respond quickly to changing situations. When combined with Workday’s financial management and HCM solutions, organizations are able to leverage real-time transactional data to dynamically adjust and recalibrate their plans.
Analytics and Benchmarking and Workday Cloud Platform: Solutions for the Offices of the CIO, CFO, and CHRO
In the changing world of work, Workday helps leaders make sense of the vast amount of data they collect enterprise-wide. For example, information technology (“IT”) leaders are navigating the complexities of supporting employees in new environments, which requires them to deploy an adaptable, secure architecture to help ensure global continuity and productivity while remaining agile. Workday provides applications for analytics and reporting, including augmented analytics to surface insights to the line of business in simple-to-understand stories, machine learning to drive efficiency and automation, and benchmarks to compare performance against other companies. In addition, Workday enables the development of extension applications and integration tooling that can accommodate our customers’ unique ways of doing business.
Industries: Solutions for the Offices of the CIO, CFO, and CHRO
Workday offers businesses flexible solutions to help them adapt to their industry-specific needs and respond to change. Workday’s applications serve industries such as healthcare, higher education, and professional services. For example, Workday provides supply chain and inventory solutions to healthcare organizations, allowing them to purchase, stock, track, and replenish their inventory to help support patient care. In addition, higher education institutions can deploy our solution to manage the end-to-end student and faculty lifecycle. Moreover, with our solution, professional services organizations can optimize and manage their client-facing projects.
Product Development
At Workday, innovation is a core value. Our culture encourages out-of-the-box thinking and creativity, which enables us to create applications designed to change the way people work. We invest a significant percentage of our resources in product development and are committed to rapidly building and/or acquiring new applications and solutions. Our product development organization is responsible for product design, development, testing, and certification. We focus our efforts on developing new applications and core technologies, as well as further enhancing the usability, functionality, reliability, security, performance, and flexibility of existing applications.
Human Capital
Workday was founded with the idea of putting people at the center of enterprise software, which is why employees are our number one core value. Our core values continue to serve as our guide as we navigate recent events, such as the global pandemic and the social justice movement.
As of January 31, 2021, our global workforce consisted of approximately 12,500 employees in 32 countries. We consider our relations with our employees to be very good. Our Chief People Officer, in partnership with our Chief Diversity Officer, is responsible for developing and executing Workday’s human capital strategy, including programs focused on total rewards; belonging and diversity; and employee development, engagement, and wellbeing. Our Chief People Officer and Co-CEOs regularly update our Board of Directors and Compensation Committee on human capital matters, and seek their input on subjects such as succession planning, executive compensation, and our company-wide equity programs.
Total Rewards
Our compensation philosophy is designed to establish and maintain a fair and flexible compensation program that attracts and rewards talented individuals who possess the skills necessary to support our near-term objectives, create long-term value for our stockholders, grow our business, and assist in the achievement of our strategic goals. We believe that providing employees with competitive pay, ownership in the company, and a wide range of benefits is fundamental to employees feeling valued, motivated, and recognized for their contributions. Equity ownership is a key element of our compensation program, allowing employees to share in Workday’s successes and aligning the interests of our employees with our stockholders. Additionally, our total rewards package includes market-competitive pay, an employee stock purchase plan, healthcare and retirement benefits, paid time off, and family leave. It also offers specialized benefits such as support for fertility options and new parents, as well as reimbursement of adoption costs. In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, we felt that it was important for employees to have a safe, convenient way to access healthcare and the time and resources necessary to address their individual and family healthcare needs. To that end, we introduced a global virtual healthcare network, expanded our sick leave policy, and offered additional support for caregivers.
Our Commitment to Pay Parity
We believe that all employees deserve to be paid fairly and equitably and be afforded an equal chance to succeed. We have a market-based pay structure that compares our roles to those of our peers in each region. This process helps ensure we pay according to the market value of the jobs we offer. We also have processes in place to make pay decisions based on internally consistent and fair criteria. Each year during our annual compensation cycle, we conduct a company-wide pay equity analysis to help ensure pay equity between men and women as well as a US-based analysis with respect to people of different races. If we identify differences in pay, we research those differences and, if appropriate, take action (including making adjustments to employees’ pay when appropriate).
Belonging and Diversity
We strive to be a workplace where all employees are valued for their unique perspectives and where we all collectively contribute to Workday’s success and innovation. Belonging and Diversity (“B&D”) plays an integral part in that as we aim to provide our employees with programs and resources that strengthen our culture and empower our communities. In support of our efforts, we have created our own unique approach to diversity called VIBETM, which stands for Value Inclusion, Belonging, and Equity.
To further support equity in our workplace and in our communities, we have established four guiding principles: hiring and developing diverse talent; cultivating a culture of belonging; strengthening our communities; and building inclusive products and technology. In addition, we have announced company commitments that map to these global guiding principles. To track progress and plan for the future, we use internally-developed products to bring diversity- and inclusion-related data into one centralized location and set our B&D strategy. Through these products, we can assess, measure, benchmark, and manage diversity and inclusion as well as empower our leaders to create B&D plans and measure performance and outcomes across areas such as hiring, development, and employee experience.
Learning and Development
Our employees tell us they are most engaged when they are continuously being exposed to new things, empowered to build new skills, and able to make an impact. We offer a number of educational resources, development opportunities, and a support community to guide employees throughout their Workday careers, which we refer to as journeys. These begin right from the moment employees start at Workday, with Learning at Workday, journeys designed to help new employees onboard and get acquainted with our culture, business, and technology. These are complimented by Career Building at Workday, journeys designed to deepen expertise, grow capabilities, and make meaningful connections, and Leading at Workday, journeys that help employees understand our leadership identity and prepare them to take on increasing leadership responsibilities. In the first half of fiscal 2022, we expect to launch the VIBE Way at Workday - journeys that explore why it is important to value inclusion, belonging, and equity and equip employees with the tools and resources to put VIBE into action.
Communication and Engagement
Our culture and how we treat people are paramount at Workday, and we believe that being transparent and facilitating information sharing are key to our success. Workday leverages multiple communication channels to engage and inform employees, including company meetings, town halls, internal websites, social collaboration tools, and targeted engagement surveys.
Buoyed by the opportunities offered by our own technology, our talent strategy, called Performance Enablement, puts employees at the center of their own career and performance journey. A fundamental tenet of this approach is the belief that we should provide employees with the tools and framework to enable their careers, putting them in the driver’s seat. Performance Enablement is centered on five factors that fuel employee success: enable contribution, grow capabilities, empower career, deepen connections, and align compensation and recognition.
Our talent and performance dashboard measures performance and includes a summary of an employee’s five factors, valuable data, and a better indication of where they stand in terms of performance. The dashboard also provides a snapshot view of performance-related tasks, with a visual summary of goals, connections, strengths, and growth opportunities.
Health, Safety, and Wellbeing
At Workday, we take a holistic approach to our employees’ wellbeing and have created wellbeing programs that focus on four core pillars: happiness, health, movement, and nutrition. These programs go beyond traditional medical benefits and wellness offerings and allow employees to focus on their chosen wellness goals as well as their mental health.
Specific to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have taken precautions to help support the health and safety of the Workday community, including our employees. As part of our support, we provided the majority of our employees with a one-time payment-equivalent to two-weeks’ pay-to help accommodate any unforeseen costs; announced that the majority of employees will not be required to return to their Workday office before August 2021; made an additional $1 million investment in the Workday Employee Relief Fund, through which employees around the world may be eligible for up to $5,000 USD for reasonable expenses caused by the COVID-19 pandemic; and provided a $500 per employee equipment stipend to enable employees to have a comfortable work-from-home environment. To help keep health and mental wellness top of mind during a particularly challenging year, we created a series of programs and communications focused on mental health. These included tools and resources related to sleep, healthy eating, and mindfulness, as well as enhancements to our Employee Assistance Program to, among other things, facilitate access to mental health services.
Our Global Workplace Safety team supports the traditional corporate areas of employee health and safety and physical security for Workday on a global scale. From the workplace to work-related travel, we strive to keep our employees safe with programs including safety awareness training, emergency response protocols, and our ergonomics and life safety team programs.
Giving and Doing
In support of our efforts to give back to the communities where we live and work, we believe that talent is everywhere, but opportunity is not. Our employees donate time and expertise as mentors and volunteers to help close the skills gap. We also invest in leading workforce development organizations and provide direct training and employment opportunities for candidates facing barriers to employment through our Opportunity Onramps programs. On top of our strategic, company-led social impact and employee volunteerism efforts, we also believe that giving back is even more rewarding when people get to make an impact through their favorite causes. We encourage and support employee giving and volunteering through programs such as our charitable donation matching gift program and our team volunteer experience, where employee teams of five or more can volunteer with a charity partner of their choice and receive a $5,000 grant.
Customers
We have built a company culture centered around customer success and satisfaction. We primarily sell to medium-sized and large, global companies that span numerous industry categories, including technology, financial services, business and professional services, healthcare and life sciences, manufacturing, retail, and hospitality, as well as to educational institutions, government agencies, and nonprofit organizations.
As part of their subscription, customers are provided support services and tools to enhance their experience with Workday applications. This includes 24/7 support; training; a professional services ecosystem of trained Workday consulting teams and system integrators; a Customer Success Management group to assist customers in production; and Workday Community, an online portal where customers can collaborate and share knowledge and best practices.
We have supported our customers navigating the COVID-19 pandemic with the delivery of solutions and partnerships focused on assisting organizations through the changing world of work. For example, our Workday Return to Workplace offerings help enable organizations to plan return to workplace scenarios, support worker well-being, and understand critical health, vaccine, and safety risk information. We have also shifted all training, deployments, and support to be virtual. We also launched a COVID-19 customer information center on our Workday Community site, which provides access to resources about our business continuity plans, product configuration, reports for managing the impact of COVID-19, and regulatory developments.
Sales and Marketing
We sell our subscription contracts and related services globally, primarily through our direct sales organization, which consists of field sales and field sales support personnel. The Workday Field Sales team is aligned by geography, industry, and/or prospect size. We generate customer leads, accelerate sales opportunities, and build brand awareness through our marketing programs and strategic relationships. Our marketing programs target senior business leaders, including CFOs, CHROs, and CIOs.
As a core part of our sales and marketing strategy, we have developed a global ecosystem of partners to both broaden and complement our application offerings and to provide services that are outside of our area of focus. These relationships include software and technology partners, consulting and deployment service providers, business process outsourcing partners, and software partners of Workday Ventures, our strategic investment arm, who all help enable Workday to address the challenges our customers face while focusing on executing against our strategy.
Seasonality
We have experienced seasonality in terms of when we enter into customer agreements for our services. Historically, we have signed a significantly higher percentage of agreements with new customers, as well as renewal agreements with existing customers, in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year due to large enterprise account buying patterns. As a result, our billings and subscription revenue backlog have been highest in the fourth quarter. Although these seasonal factors are common in the technology industry, historical patterns should not be considered a reliable indicator of our future sales activity or performance.
Competition
The overall market for enterprise application software is rapidly evolving, highly competitive, and subject to changing technology, shifting customer needs, and frequent introductions of new products. We currently compete with large, well-established, enterprise application software vendors, such as Oracle Corporation (“Oracle”) and SAP SE (“SAP”). We also face competition from other enterprise software vendors, from regional competitors that only operate in certain geographic markets, and from vendors of specific applications that address only one or a portion of our applications, some of which offer cloud-based solutions. These vendors include UKG Inc. (formerly The Ultimate Software Group, Inc.); Automatic Data Processing, Inc.; Infor, Inc.; Ceridian HCM Holding Inc.; Microsoft Corporation; Anaplan, Inc.; Coupa Software Inc.; and Unit4.
In addition, other cloud companies that provide services in different markets may develop applications or acquire companies that operate in our target markets, and some potential customers may elect to develop their own internal applications. However, the domain and industry expertise that is required for a successful solution in the areas of financial management, HCM, and analytics may inhibit new entrants that are unable to invest the necessary capital to accurately address global requirements and regulations. We expect continued consolidation in our industry that could lead to significantly increased competition.
We believe the principal competitive factors in our markets include:
•level of customer satisfaction and quality of customer references;
•speed to deploy and ease of use;
•breadth and depth of application functionality;
•total cost of ownership;
•brand awareness and reputation;
•adaptive technology platform;
•capability for configuration, integration, security, scalability, and reliability of applications;
•operational excellence to ensure system availability, scalability, and performance;
•ability to innovate and rapidly respond to customer needs;
•domain and industry expertise in applicable laws and regulations;
•size of customer base and level of user adoption;
•customer confidence in financial stability and future viability; and
•ability to integrate with legacy enterprise infrastructure and third-party applications.
We believe that we compete favorably based on these factors. Our ability to remain competitive will largely depend on our ongoing performance in product development and customer support.
For more information regarding the competitive risks we face, see “Risk Factors” included in Part I,","ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS
Investing in our securities involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, together with all of the other information in this report, including the consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, before making an investment decision. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of, or that we currently believe are not material, may also become important factors that materially and adversely affect our business. If any of the following risks actually occurs, our business operations, financial condition, operating results, and prospects could be materially and adversely affected. The market price of our securities could decline due to the materialization of these or any other risks, and you could lose part or all of your investment.
Summary of Risk Factors
The below summary risks provide an overview of the material risks we are exposed to in the normal course of our business activities. The below summary risks do not contain all of the information that may be important to you, and you should read these together with the more detailed discussion of risks set forth following this section, as well as elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K under the heading “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” Additional risks beyond those summarized below, or discussed elsewhere in “Risk Factors” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” may apply to our activities or operations as currently conducted or as we may conduct them in the future, or to the markets in which we currently operate or may in the future operate. Consistent with the foregoing, we are exposed to a variety of risks, including those associated with the following:
•the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the resulting global economic volatility, and measures taken in response to the pandemic may materially and adversely affect our business, operating results, financial condition, and earnings guidance that we may issue from time to time;
•if our security measures are breached or unauthorized access to customer or user data is otherwise obtained, our applications may be perceived as not being secure, customers and end users may reduce the use of or stop using our applications, and we may incur significant liabilities;
•if we fail to properly manage our technical operations infrastructure, including our data centers and computing infrastructure operated by third parties, experience service outages or delays in the deployment of our applications, or our applications fail to perform properly, we may be subject to liabilities and our reputation and operating results may be adversely affected;
•privacy concerns and evolving domestic or foreign laws and regulations may reduce the effectiveness of our applications, result in significant costs and compliance challenges, and adversely affect our business and operating results;
•the markets in which we participate are intensely competitive, and if we do not compete effectively, our operating results could be adversely affected;
•our quarterly results may fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control, and such fluctuations and related impacts to any earnings guidance we may issue from time to time, or any modification or withdrawal thereof, may negatively impact the value of our securities;
•if we are not able to realize a return on our current development efforts or offer new features, enhancements, and modifications to our products and services, our business and operating results could be adversely affected; additionally, if we are not able to realize a return on the investments we have made toward entering new markets and new lines of business, including as a result of unfavorable laws, regulations, interpretive positions, or standards governing new and evolving technologies we incorporate into our products and services, our business and operating results could be adversely affected;
•if we are unable to establish or maintain our strategic relationships with third parties, or fail to successfully integrate our applications with a variety of third-party technologies, our ability to compete or grow our revenues may be impaired and our operating results may suffer;
•we have acquired, and may in the future acquire, other companies, employee teams, or technologies, which could divert our management's attention, result in additional dilution to our stockholders, and otherwise disrupt our operations and adversely affect our operating results;
•if we fail to manage our growth effectively, we may be unable to execute our business plan, maintain high levels of service and operational controls, or adequately address competitive challenges;
•we may lose key employees or be unable to attract, train and retain highly skilled employees, which may adversely affect our business and future growth prospects;
•if we cannot maintain our corporate culture, we may lose the innovation, teamwork, and passion that we believe contribute to our success, and our business may be harmed;
•because we encounter long sales cycles when selling to large customers and we recognize subscription services revenue over the term of the contract, downturns or upturns in new sales will not be immediately reflected in our operating results and it may be difficult to predict a negative impact on our operating and financial results; additionally, our ability to predict the rate of customer subscription renewals or adoptions is limited;
•our business could be adversely affected if our users are not satisfied with the deployment, training, and support services provided by us and our partners, and such dissatisfaction could damage our ability to expand the applications subscribed to by our current customers and negatively impact our ability to compete for new business;
•sales to customers outside the United States or with international operations expose us to risks inherent in global operations;
•we have a history of cumulative net losses and we may not be profitable on a basis prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”) for the foreseeable future;
•any failure to protect our intellectual property rights domestically and internationally could impair our ability to protect our proprietary technology and our brand; additionally, we may be sued by third parties for alleged infringement of their proprietary rights or in connection with our use of open source software;
•risks related to government contracts and related procurement regulations, including risks of fines and termination of such contracts by the government at any time, may adversely impact our business and operating results;
•the dual class structure of our common stock has the effect of concentrating voting control with our Chairman and co-CEO, as well as with other executive officers, directors, and affiliates, which gives our Chairman and co-CEO and other members of management control over key decisions and limits or precludes the ability of non-affiliates to influence corporate matters;
•our substantial indebtedness may adversely affect our financial condition and operating results;
•our convertible note hedge and warrant transactions may adversely affect the value of our Class A common stock;
•Delaware law and provisions in our restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws could make a merger, tender offer, or proxy contest sought by third parties difficult, thereby depressing the market price of our Class A common stock; and
•the exclusive forum provision in our organizational documents may limit a stockholder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or any of our directors, officers, or other employees, which may discourage lawsuits with respect to such claims.
Risks Related to Our Business and Industry
The extent to which the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the resulting global economic volatility, and measures taken in response to the pandemic will continue to impact our business, operating results, and financial condition will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and difficult to predict.
The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted the U.S. and global economies and put unprecedented strain on governments, healthcare systems, educational institutions, businesses, and individuals around the world, the impact and duration of which is difficult to assess or predict. It is especially difficult to predict the impact on the global economic markets, which have been and will continue to be highly dependent upon the actions of governments, businesses, and other enterprises in response to the pandemic, as well as the effectiveness of those actions. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the trading prices for our Class A common stock and the stock of other technology companies have been highly volatile, and such volatility may continue for the duration of and possibly beyond the COVID-19 pandemic. Any sustained adverse impacts from the continued spread of COVID-19 could materially and adversely affect our business, operating results, financial condition, and earnings guidance that we may issue from time to time, which could have a material effect on the value of our Class A common stock.
In response to COVID-19, as many other companies have done, we have temporarily closed the majority of our global offices; required most of our employees to continue to work remotely; implemented travel restrictions; and postponed or canceled certain of our customer, industry, implementation partner, analyst, investor, and employee events, and converted other events to virtual-only experiences. These precautionary measures could have increasingly negative effects on our sales and marketing efforts, customer success efforts, and revenue growth rates or other financial metrics, or create operational or other challenges, any of which could adversely impact our business, operating results, and financial condition in any given period. We may also continue to experience impacts to productivity and other operational and business impacts if our employees, executives, or their family members experience health issues, or if there are continued delays in our hiring and onboarding of new employees. The COVID-19 pandemic may also have long-term effects on the nature of the office environment and remote working, which may present risks for our real estate portfolio, as well as strategy, operational, and workplace culture challenges that may adversely affect our business. The COVID-19 pandemic could also impact our data center and computing infrastructure operations, including potential disruptions to, among other things, the supply chain required to maintain these systems, construction projects designed to expand our data center capacity, and primary vendors who provide critical products and services.
Our future revenues rely on continued demand by existing customers and the acquisition of new customers. We have experienced and may continue to experience increased delays in purchasing decisions from prospective customers and a reduction in customer demand, particularly in the industries most impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, such as travel and hospitality and healthcare. We may also continue to experience a reduction in renewal rates, particularly within our subset of small and medium-sized planning customers, as well as reduced customer spend and delayed payments, which could materially impact our business, operating results, and financial condition in future periods. In addition, some of our competitors may offer their products and services at a lower price, or may offer delayed payment terms, financing terms, or other terms and conditions that are more enticing to potential customers. While our subscription services revenue is relatively predictable in the near term as a result of our subscription-based business model, the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic may not be fully reflected in our operating results and overall financial performance until future periods.
It is not possible for us to estimate the duration or magnitude of the adverse results of the COVID-19 pandemic and its effects on our business, operating results, or financial condition at this time, as the impact will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and difficult to predict. To the extent the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects our business, operating results, and financial condition, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this “Risk Factors” section.
If we fail to properly manage our technical operations infrastructure, experience service outages, undergo delays in the deployment of our applications, or our applications fail to perform properly, we may be subject to liabilities and our reputation and operating results may be adversely affected.
We have experienced significant growth in the number of users, transactions, and data that our operations infrastructure supports. We seek to maintain sufficient excess capacity in our operations infrastructure to meet the needs of all of our customers and users, as well as our own needs, and to ensure that our services and solutions are accessible within an acceptable load time. We also seek to maintain excess capacity to facilitate the rapid provision of new customer deployments and the expansion of existing customer deployments. In addition, we need to properly manage our technological operations infrastructure in order to support version control, changes in hardware and software parameters, updates, and the evolution of our applications, and to reduce infrastructure latency associated with dispersed geographic locations. However, the provision of new hosting infrastructure requires significant lead time. If we do not accurately predict our infrastructure requirements, we may experience service outages. Furthermore, if our operations infrastructure fails to scale, we may experience delays in providing service as we seek to obtain additional capacity, and no assurance can be made that we will be able to secure such additional capacity on the same or similar terms as we currently have, which could result in a significant increase in our operating costs. Moreover, any failure to scale and secure additional capacity could result in delays in new feature rollouts, reduce the demand for our applications, result in customer and end user dissatisfaction, and adversely affect our business and operating results.
We have experienced, and may in the future experience, defects, system disruptions, outages, and other performance problems, including the failure of our applications to perform properly. These problems may be caused by a variety of factors, including infrastructure changes, vendor issues, software and system defects, human error, viruses, worms, security attacks (internal and external), fraud, spikes in customer usage, and denial of service issues. In some instances, we may not be able to identify the cause or causes of these performance problems within an acceptable period of time. Because of the large amount of data that we collect and process in our systems, even if we do not experience a customer outage as a result of these issues, it is possible that these issues could result in significant disruption, data loss or corruption, or cause the data to be incomplete or contain inaccuracies that our customers and other users regard as significant. Additionally, such issues may also result in vulnerabilities that could inadvertently result in unauthorized access to data. Furthermore, the availability or performance of our applications could also be adversely affected by our customers’ and other users’ inability to access the internet. For example, our customers and other users access our applications through their internet service providers. If a service provider fails to provide sufficient capacity to support our applications or otherwise experiences service outages, such failure could interrupt our customers’ and other users’ access to our applications, which could adversely affect their perception of our applications’ reliability and our revenues.
Our customer agreements typically provide for monthly service level commitments. If we are unable to meet the stated service level commitments or suffer extended periods of unavailability for our applications as a result of the foregoing or otherwise, we may be contractually obligated to issue service credits or refunds to customers for prepaid and unused subscription services, our customers may make warranty or other claims against us, or we could face contract terminations, which would adversely affect our attrition rates. Any extended service outages could result in customer losses and adversely affect our reputation, business, and operating results.
Furthermore, our financial management application is essential to our and our customers’ financial planning, reporting, and compliance programs. Any interruption in our service may affect the availability, accuracy, or timeliness of such programs and as a result could damage our reputation, cause our customers to terminate their use of our applications, require us to issue refunds for prepaid and unused subscription services, require us to compensate our customers for certain losses, and prevent us from gaining additional business from current or future customers. In addition, because we use Workday's financial management application, any problems that we experience with financial reporting and compliance could be negatively perceived by prospective or current customers and negatively impact demand for our applications.
Our errors and omissions insurance may be inadequate or may not be available in the future on acceptable terms, or at all, to protect against claims and other legal actions. In addition, our policy may not cover all claims made against us and defending a suit, regardless of its merit, could be costly and divert management’s attention.
We depend on data centers and computing infrastructure operated by third parties, and any disruption in these operations could adversely affect our business and operating results.
We host our applications and serve our customers from data centers located in the United States, Canada, and Europe. While we control and have access to our servers and all of the components of our network that are located in these data centers, we do not control certain aspects of these facilities, including their operation and security. The owners of these data center facilities have limited or no obligation to renew their agreements with us on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. If we are unable to renew these agreements on commercially reasonable terms, or if any of these data center operators are acquired or cease to do business, we may be required to transfer our servers and other infrastructure to new data center facilities, and we may incur significant costs and experience possible service interruptions in connection with doing so.
In addition, we also rely upon third-party hosted infrastructure partners globally, including Amazon Web Services (“AWS”), Dimension Data, Microsoft Corporation, and Google LLC, to serve customers and operate certain aspects of our services, such as environments for development and testing, training, sales demonstrations, and production usage. Any disruption of or interference at our hosted infrastructure partners would impact our operations and our business could be adversely impacted.
Problems faced by these data center operators or hosted infrastructure partners, with the telecommunications network providers with whom we or they contract, or with the systems by which our telecommunications providers allocate capacity among their customers, including us, could adversely affect the experience of our customers or other users. Furthermore, these data center operators or hosted infrastructure partners could decide to close their facilities, cease operations without adequate notice, or stop providing contracted services. In addition, any financial difficulties, such as bankruptcy, faced by these data center operators, our hosted infrastructure partners, or any of the other service providers with whom we or they contract may have negative effects on our business, the nature and extent of which are difficult to predict. These facilities may also be subject to break-ins, sabotage, intentional acts of vandalism and similar misconduct, natural catastrophic events, as well as local administrative actions (including shelter-in-place or similar orders), changes to legal or permitting requirements, and litigation to stop, limit or delay operation.
Additionally, if these data center operators or hosted infrastructure partners are unable to keep up with our needs for capacity, this could have an adverse effect on our business. Any changes in third-party service levels at these data centers or at our hosted infrastructure partners, or any errors, defects, disruptions, or other performance problems with our applications or the infrastructure on which they run, could adversely affect our reputation and may damage our customers’ or other users’ stored files or result in lengthy interruptions in our services. Interruptions in our services might adversely affect our reputation and operating results, cause us to issue refunds or service credits to customers for prepaid and unused subscription services, subject us to potential liabilities, result in contract terminations, or adversely affect our renewal rates.
We may lose key employees or be unable to attract, train, and retain highly skilled employees.
Our success and future growth depend largely upon the continued services of our executive officers, other members of senior management, and other key employees. We do not have employment agreements with our executive officers or other key personnel that require them to continue to work for us for any specified period, and they could terminate their employment with us at any time. From time to time, there may be changes in our executive management team and to other key employee roles resulting from organizational changes or the hiring or departure of executives or other employees, which could have a serious adverse effect on our business and operating results. Moreover, if key personnel become ill due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, we may not be able to manage our business effectively and, as a result, our business and operating results could be harmed.
To execute our growth plan, we must attract, train, and retain highly qualified personnel. In the technology industry, and particularly in the San Francisco Bay Area, the competition is intense for highly skilled employees, especially for engineers with significant experience in designing and developing software and internet-related services, including in the areas of machine learning and artificial intelligence; for cybersecurity professionals; and for senior sales executives. In addition, the expansion of our sales infrastructure, both domestically and internationally, is necessary to grow our customer base and business. Identifying and recruiting qualified personnel and training them in our sales methodology, our sales systems, and the use of our software requires significant time, expense, and attention. Our business may be adversely affected if our efforts to attract and train new members of our direct sales force do not generate a corresponding increase in revenues. From time to time, we have experienced, and we expect to continue to experience, difficulty in hiring and retaining employees with appropriate qualifications, and we may not be able to fill positions in desired geographic areas or at all.
Many of the companies with which we compete for experienced personnel have greater resources than we have and may offer more lucrative compensation packages than we offer. Our business may be adversely affected if we are unable to retain our highly skilled employees, especially our senior sales executives. Job candidates and existing employees carefully consider the value of the equity awards they receive in connection with their employment. If the perceived or actual value of our equity awards declines, or if the mix of equity and cash compensation that we offer is not sufficiently attractive, it may adversely affect our ability to recruit and retain highly skilled employees. Our recruiting efforts may also be limited by laws and regulations, such as restrictive immigration laws, and restrictions on travel or availability of visas (including during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic). Additionally, job candidates may be threatened with legal action under agreements with their existing employers if we attempt to hire them, which could have a chilling effect on hiring and result in a diversion of our time and resources. We must also continue to retain and motivate existing employees through our compensation practices, company culture, and career development opportunities. If we fail to attract new personnel or to retain our current personnel, our business and future growth prospects could be adversely affected.
If we cannot maintain our corporate culture, we could lose the innovation, teamwork, and passion that we believe contribute to our success, and our business may be harmed.
We believe that a critical component of our success has been our corporate culture, as reflected in our core values: employees, customer service, innovation, integrity, inclusion, fun, and profitability. We also believe that our commitment to our corporate culture, as well as our commitment to building products and services that help provide our customers with information regarding their own workforce and corporate culture, is part of the reason why our customers choose us. As we continue to grow, both organically and through acquisitions of employee teams, and develop the infrastructure associated with being a more mature public company, we will need to maintain our corporate culture among a larger number of employees who are dispersed throughout various geographic regions. Additionally, we and our stakeholders increasingly expect to have a corporate culture that embraces diversity and inclusion, and any inability to attract and retain diverse and qualified personnel may harm our corporate culture and our business. Moreover, the COVID-19 pandemic requires significant action to preserve culture with an employee base temporarily working remotely and facing unique personal and professional challenges. Any failure to preserve our culture could negatively affect our future success, including our ability to retain and recruit personnel and to achieve our corporate objectives, including our ability to quickly develop and deliver new and innovative products.
Our business could be adversely affected if our users are not satisfied with the deployment, training, and support services provided by us and our partners.
Our business depends on our ability to satisfy our customers and end users, both with respect to our application offerings and the professional services that are performed to help them use features and functions that address their business needs. High customer satisfaction requires that our customers undergo a successful implementation and be properly trained on our applications to effectively implement and increase their level of adoption of such applications. Incorrect or improper implementation or use of our applications could result in customer and user dissatisfaction and harm our business and operating results.
Professional services may be performed by our own staff, by a third party, or by a combination of the two. Our strategy is to work with third parties to increase the breadth of capability and depth of capacity for delivery of these services to our customers, and third parties provide a majority of deployment services for our customers. The work performed by us or these third parties that we rely on, including any work related to the on-site components of deployment services requested by a customer, might be adversely impacted directly or indirectly by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, including as a result of restrictions in accessing customer sites. Additionally, if our customers’ personnel are unable to participate in deployment activities as a direct or indirect result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, this could result in delays in customer go-live dates for our applications. If customers are not satisfied with the quality and timing of work performed by us or a third party or with the type of professional services or applications delivered, or if we or a third party have not fully delivered on certain commitments made to our customers, then we could incur additional costs to address the situation, the revenue recognition of the contract could be impacted, and the dissatisfaction with our services could damage our ability to expand the applications subscribed to by our customers. We must also align our product development and professional services operations in order to ensure that customers’ evolving needs are met. Negative publicity related to our customer relationships, regardless of its accuracy, may further damage our business by affecting our ability to compete for new business with current and prospective customers both domestic and abroad.
Additionally, in order to maximize the value of our applications, we must continue to educate and train our customers and end users to develop the skills necessary to harness the power of our applications. If we are not able to effectively educate and train our users, they may choose not to renew their subscriptions, market perceptions of our company and our applications may be impaired, and our reputation and brand may suffer. Customers and other users also depend on our support organization to provision the environments used by our customers and to resolve technical issues relating to our applications. We may be unable to respond quickly enough to accommodate short-term increases in demand for support services. We may also be unable to modify the format of our support services to compete with changes in support services provided by our competitors. Increased demand for these services, without corresponding revenues, could increase costs and adversely affect our operating results. Failure to maintain high-quality technical support and training, or a market perception that we do not maintain high-quality support or training, could adversely affect our reputation, our ability to offer and sell our applications, our renewal rates, and our business and operating results.
Our future success depends on the rate of customer subscription renewals or adoptions, and our revenues or operating results could be adversely impacted if we do not achieve renewals and adoptions at expected rates or on anticipated terms.
As the markets for our applications mature, or as new competitors introduce new products or services that compete with ours, we may be unable to attract new customers at the same price or based on the same pricing model as we have used historically. From time to time, we may also change our pricing structure, which could adversely impact demand for our products. Moreover, large customers, which are a primary focus of our sales efforts, have and may continue to request greater price concessions and delayed payment terms. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, some of our existing and potential customers have deferred, and may continue to defer, purchasing decisions, request price concessions and delayed payment terms, and request other terms and conditions. As a result, in the future we may be required to reduce our prices or accept onerous terms and conditions, including delayed payment terms, which could adversely affect our revenues, profitability, financial position, and cash flows in any given period. Restrictions on travel and in-person meetings have interrupted, and could continue to interrupt, our sales activity, and we cannot predict whether, for how long, or the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic may continue to have an impact. Our sales force has historically met with our customers and potential customers face-to-face when selling our solutions, and while the majority of our deployment activities are completed remotely, many of our customers may prefer to have certain deployment activities such as project initiation and go-live activities completed on-site. Furthermore, because our future revenue growth relies, in large part, on new customer acquisition, any inability of our sales force to establish relationships with potential customers during the current environment or prospects deferring buying decisions due to the economic uncertainty is likely to have a negative impact on our future revenue growth and other financial measures.
In addition, our customers have no obligation to renew their subscriptions for our applications after the expiration of either the initial or renewed subscription period. If we are unable to successfully educate our customers on the benefits and features of our applications, or if our customers are aware of those benefits and features but do not use them, our customers may renew for fewer elements of our applications or on different pricing terms. Our customers’ renewal rates may also decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of other factors, including their level of satisfaction with our applications and pricing, their ability to continue their operations and spending levels, and the evolution of their business. If our customers do not renew their subscriptions for our applications on similar pricing terms, our revenues may decline, and we may not be able to meet our revenue projections, which could negatively impact our business and the market price of our Class A common stock. In addition, over time the average term of our contracts could change based on renewal rates or for other reasons.
Our future success also depends, in part, on our ability to sell additional products to our current customers, and the success rate of such endeavors is difficult to predict, especially with regard to any new lines of business that we may introduce from time to time. This may require increasingly costly marketing and sales efforts that are targeted at senior management, and if these efforts are not successful, our business and operating results may suffer. Additionally, acquisitions of our customers by other companies have led, and could continue to lead, to cancellation of our contracts with those customers, thereby reducing the number of our existing and potential customers.
Our quarterly results may fluctuate significantly and may not fully reflect the underlying performance of our business.
Our quarterly operating results, including our revenues, operating margin, profitability, cash flow, unearned revenue, and remaining subscription services revenue performance obligations, or backlog, may vary significantly in the future and period-to-period comparisons of our operating results may not be meaningful. Accordingly, the results of any one quarter should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance. Our quarterly financial results may fluctuate as a result of a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control, and as a result, may not fully reflect the underlying performance of our business. As discussed above, the extent to which the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the resulting global economic uncertainty, and measures taken in response to the pandemic could continue to impact our operating results will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and difficult to predict. For example, beginning in March 2020, we began experiencing and continue to experience unfavorable impacts to our new subscription bookings, causing us to reduce our fiscal 2021 subscription revenue outlook. Fluctuations in our quarterly results and related impacts to any earnings guidance we may issue from time to time, including any modification or withdrawal thereof, may negatively impact the value of our securities.
Additional factors that may cause fluctuations in our quarterly financial results include, without limitation, those listed below:
•our ability to attract new customers, customer renewal rates, the financial condition and creditworthiness of our customers, and the timing and rate at which we sign agreements with customers;
•the addition or loss of large customers, including through acquisitions or consolidations;
•regulatory compliance costs, including research and development costs incurred to add functionality to help our customers comply with evolving privacy and data security laws;
•the timing of recognition of revenues and operating expenses, including expenses related to acquisitions and potential future charges for impairment of goodwill;
•the amount and timing of operating expenses related to the maintenance and expansion of our business, operations, and infrastructure;
•network outages or security breaches;
•general economic, market and geopolitical conditions, including the impact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic;
•increases or decreases in the number of elements of our services or pricing changes upon any renewals of customer agreements;
•the changes in payment terms and timing of customer payments and payment defaults by customers, including those significantly impacted by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic;
•changes in our pricing policies or those of our competitors and the mix of applications sold during a period;
•seasonal variations in sales of our applications, which have historically been highest in our fiscal fourth quarter;
•the timing and success of new application and service introductions by us or our competitors;
•changes in the competitive dynamics of our industry, including consolidation among competitors, customers, or strategic partners, and the impact of strategic partnerships, acquisitions, or equity investments;
•expenses related to our real estate portfolio, including our leases and data center expansion; and
•changes in laws and regulations that impact our business or reported financial results, including changes in accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
We have experienced rapid growth, and if we fail to manage our growth effectively, we may be unable to execute our business plan, maintain high levels of service and operational controls, or adequately address competitive challenges.
We have experienced rapid growth in our customers, headcount, and operations and anticipate that we will continue to expand our customer base, headcount, and operations. This growth has placed, and future growth will place, a significant strain on our management, administrative, operational, and financial infrastructure. Our success will depend in part on our ability to manage this growth effectively and to scale our operations appropriately. To manage the expected growth of our operations and personnel, we will need to continue to improve our operational, financial, and management controls as well as our reporting systems and procedures. Failure to effectively manage growth could result in difficulty or delays in deploying products and services to customers, declines in quality or customer satisfaction, increases in costs, difficulties in introducing new features, or other operational difficulties, and any of these difficulties could adversely impact our business performance and operating results.
If we fail to develop widespread brand awareness cost-effectively, our business may suffer.
We believe that developing and maintaining widespread positive awareness of our brand is critical to achieving widespread acceptance of our applications, retaining and attracting customers, and hiring and retaining employees. However, brand promotion activities may not generate the customer awareness or increased revenues we anticipate, and even if they do, any increase in revenues may not offset the significant expenses we incur in building our brand. Moreover, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has made it more difficult to develop and maintain positive awareness of our brand. For example, we did not hold our two largest annual customer conferences for fiscal year 2021, Workday Rising and Workday Rising Europe. We also transitioned Adaptive Live, our customer experience for Workday Adaptive Planning customers as well as our global event series, Workday Elevate, from in-person to digital event experiences. Our shift to creating virtual customer, industry, partner, analyst, investor and employee events may not be successful, and we may not be able to showcase our products as well, or generate similar levels of customer interest, opportunities, and leads through these virtual events as we have historically done through in-person events. In addition, we have and may continue to delay certain corporate advertising programs. These precautionary measures that have been adopted, particularly if extended for prolonged periods, could have increasingly negative effects on our ability to develop and maintain widespread positive awareness of our brand, which could harm our business, operating results, and financial condition. In addition, positions we take on environmental, social, governance, and ethical issues from time to time may impact our brand, reputation, or ability to attract or retain customers.
If we fail to successfully promote and maintain our brand, we may fail to attract or retain customers necessary to realize a sufficient return on our brand-building efforts, or to achieve the widespread brand awareness that is critical for broad customer adoption of our applications. Additionally, the loss of one or more of our key customers, or a failure to renew our subscription agreements with one or more of our key customers, could significantly impair our ability to market our applications which, in turn, could have a negative impact on our revenues, reputation, and our ability to obtain new customers. In addition, if our brand is negatively impacted, it may be more difficult to hire and retain employees.
We have acquired, and may in the future acquire, other companies, employee teams, or technologies, which could divert our management’s attention, result in additional dilution to our stockholders, and otherwise disrupt our operations and adversely affect our operating results.
We have acquired, and may in the future acquire, other companies, employee teams, or technologies to complement or expand our applications, enhance our technical capabilities, obtain personnel, or otherwise offer growth opportunities. For example, we acquired Adaptive Insights in fiscal 2019 and Scout in fiscal 2020, and have entered into an agreement to acquire Peakon in fiscal 2022. The pursuit of acquisitions may divert the attention of management, disrupt ongoing business, and cause us to incur various expenses in identifying, investigating, and pursuing suitable acquisitions, whether or not they are consummated.
These impacts may continue through integration activities. Moreover, we may be unable to complete proposed transactions timely or at all due to the failure to obtain regulatory or other approvals, litigation, or other disputes, which may obligate us to pay a termination fee. We also may not achieve the anticipated benefits from an acquisition due to a number of factors, including:
•inability to integrate or benefit from an acquisition in a profitable manner;
•acquisition-related costs, liabilities, or tax impacts, some of which may be unanticipated;
•difficulty in integrating the intellectual property, technology infrastructure, and operations of the acquired business, including difficulty in addressing security risks of the acquired business;
•difficulty in integrating and retaining the personnel of the acquired business, including integration of the culture of the acquired company with Workday;
•difficulty in leveraging the data of the acquired business if it includes personal data;
•ineffective or inadequate controls, procedures, or policies at the acquired company;
•multiple product lines or service offerings as a result of our acquisitions that are offered, priced, and supported differently, as well as the potential for such acquired product lines and service offerings to impact the profitability of existing products;
•the opportunity cost of diverting management and financial resources away from other products, services, and strategic initiatives;
•difficulties and additional expenses associated with synchronizing product offerings, customer relationships, and contract portfolio terms and conditions between Workday and the acquired business;
•unknown liabilities or risks associated with the acquired businesses, including those arising from existing contractual obligations or litigation matters;
•adverse effects on our existing business relationships with business partners and customers as a result of the acquisition;
•potential write-offs of acquired assets and potential financial and credit risks associated with acquired customers;
•inability to maintain relationships with key customers, suppliers, and partners of the acquired business;
•difficulty in predicting and controlling the effect of integrating multiple acquisitions concurrently;
•lack of experience in new markets, products, or technologies;
•difficulty in integrating operations and assets of an acquired foreign entity with differences in language, culture, or country-specific regulatory risks;
•the inability to obtain (or a material delay in obtaining) regulatory approvals necessary to complete transactions or to integrate operations, or potential remedies imposed by regulatory authorities as a condition to or following the completion of a transaction, which may include divestitures, ownership or operational restrictions or other structural or behavioral remedies;
•use of resources that are needed in other parts of our business; and
•use of substantial portions of our available cash to consummate the acquisition.
In addition, a significant portion of the purchase price of companies we acquire may be allocated to acquired goodwill and other intangible assets, which must be assessed for impairment at least annually. In the future, if our acquisitions do not yield expected returns, we may be required to take charges to our operating results based on this impairment assessment process, which could adversely affect our operating results.
Acquisitions could also result in dilutive issuances of equity securities or the issuance of debt, which could adversely affect our operating results. In addition, if an acquired business fails to meet our expectations, our business, operating results, and financial position may suffer.
Sales to customers outside the United States or with international operations expose us to risks inherent in global operations.
A key element of our growth strategy is to further develop our worldwide customer base. Operating globally requires significant resources and management attention and subjects us to regulatory, economic, and political risks that are different from those in the United States. Our efforts to further expand internationally may not be successful in creating additional demand for our applications outside of the United States or in effectively selling subscriptions to our applications in all of the markets we enter. Foreign regulations, including privacy and import/export regulations, are subject to change and uncertainty, including as a result of geopolitical developments, which may be amplified by the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition to navigating the challenges related to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic in foreign jurisdictions, we face other risks in doing business on a global scale that could adversely affect our business, including:
•the need to develop, localize, and adapt our applications for specific countries, including translation into foreign languages, localization of contracts for different legal jurisdictions, and associated expenses;
•the need to successfully develop and execute on a go-to-market strategy that aligns application management efforts and the development of supporting infrastructure;
•stricter data privacy laws including requirements that customer data be stored and processed in a designated territory and obligations on us as a data processor;
•difficulties in appropriately staffing and managing foreign operations and providing appropriate compensation for local markets;
•difficulties in leveraging executive presence and company culture globally;
•different pricing environments, longer sales cycles, and longer trade receivables payment cycles, and collections issues;
•new and different sources of competition;
•potentially weaker protection for intellectual property and other legal rights than in the United States and practical difficulties in enforcing intellectual property and other rights;
•laws, customs, and business practices favoring local competitors;
•restrictive governmental actions focused on cross-border trade, such as import and export restrictions, duties, quotas, tariffs, trade disputes, and barriers or sanctions that may prevent us from offering certain portions of our products or services to a particular market, may increase our operating costs or may subject us to monetary fines or penalties in case of unintentional noncompliance due to factors beyond our control;
•compliance challenges related to the complexity of multiple, conflicting, and changing governmental laws and regulations, including employment, tax, privacy, intellectual property, and data protection laws and regulations;
•increased compliance costs related to government regulatory reviews or audits, including those related to international cybersecurity requirements;
•increased financial accounting and reporting burdens and complexities;
•restrictions on the transfer of funds;
•ensuring compliance with anti-corruption laws, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and UK Bribery Act;
•the effects of currency fluctuations on our revenues and expenses and customer demand for our services;
•the cost and potential outcomes of any international claims or litigation;
•adverse tax consequences and tax rulings; and
•unstable economic and political conditions.
Any of the above factors may negatively impact our ability to sell our applications and offer services globally, reduce our competitive position in foreign markets, increase our costs of global operations, and reduce demand for our applications and services from global customers. Additionally, the majority of our international costs are denominated in local currencies and we anticipate that over time an increasing portion of our sales contracts outside the U.S. may be denominated in local currencies. Therefore, fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies may impact our operating results when translated into U.S. dollars. Such fluctuations may also impact our ability to predict our future results accurately. Although we have a hedging program to help mitigate some of this volatility and related risks, there can be no assurance that the hedging program will be effective in offsetting the adverse financial impacts that may result from unfavorable movements in foreign currency exchange rates, including any such movements caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.
The markets in which we participate are intensely competitive, and if we do not compete effectively, our operating results could be adversely affected.
The markets for enterprise cloud applications are highly competitive, with relatively low barriers to entry for some applications or services. Some of our competitors are larger and have greater name recognition, significantly longer operating histories, access to larger customer bases, larger marketing budgets, and significantly greater resources to devote to the development, promotion, and sale of their products and services than we do. This may allow our competitors to respond more effectively than us to new or emerging technologies and changes in market conditions.
Our primary competitors are Oracle and SAP, well-established providers of financial management and HCM applications, which have long-standing relationships with many customers. Some customers may be hesitant to switch vendors or to adopt cloud applications such as ours and may prefer to maintain their existing relationships with competitors. We also face competition from other enterprise software vendors, from regional competitors that only operate in certain geographic markets, and from vendors of specific applications that address only one or a portion of our applications, some of which offer cloud-based solutions. These vendors include, without limitation: UKG Inc. (formerly The Ultimate Software Group, Inc.), Automatic Data Processing, Inc., Infor, Inc., Ceridian HCM Holding Inc., Microsoft Corporation, Anaplan, Inc., and Coupa Software Inc. In order to take advantage of customer demand for cloud applications, legacy vendors are expanding their cloud applications through acquisitions, strategic alliances, and organic development. In addition, other cloud companies that provide services in different target markets may develop applications or acquire companies that operate in our target markets, and some potential customers may elect to develop their own internal applications. As the market matures and as existing and new market participants introduce new types of technologies and different approaches that enable organizations to address their HCM and financial needs, we expect this competition to intensify in the future.
Furthermore, our current or potential competitors may be acquired by, or merge with, third parties with greater available resources and the ability to initiate or withstand substantial price competition, such as the merger between Kronos Incorporated and The Ultimate Software Group, Inc. Our competitors may also establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties that may further enhance their offerings or resources. Many of our competitors also have major distribution agreements with consultants, system integrators, and resellers. If our competitors’ products, services, or technologies become more accepted than our products, if they are successful in bringing their products or services to market earlier than ours, or if their products or services are more technologically capable than ours, then our revenues could be adversely affected. In addition, our competitors may offer their products and services at a lower price, or, particularly during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, may offer price concessions, delayed payment terms, financing terms, or other terms and conditions that are more enticing to potential customers. Pricing pressures and increased competition could result in reduced sales, reduced margins, losses, or a failure to maintain or improve our competitive market position, any of which could adversely affect our business and operating results.
If we are not able to realize a return on our current development efforts or offer new features, enhancements, and modifications to our services that are desired by current or potential customers, our business and operating results could be adversely affected.
Developing software applications and related enhancements, features, and modifications is expensive, and the investment in product development often involves a long return on investment cycle. Accelerated application introductions and short application life cycles require high levels of expenditures that could adversely affect our operating results if not offset by revenue increases, and we believe that we must continue to dedicate a significant amount of resources to our development efforts to maintain our competitive position. However, we may not receive significant revenues from these investments for several years, if at all. Furthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic could have an impact on our plans to offer certain new features, enhancements, and modifications of our applications in a timely manner, particularly if we experience impacts to productivity due to our employees or their family members experiencing health issues, if our employees continue to work remotely for extended periods, or if there are continuing delays in our hiring and onboarding of new employees. If we are unable to provide new features, enhancements, and modifications in a timely and cost-effective manner that achieve market acceptance or that keep pace with rapid technological developments and changing regulatory landscapes, our business and operating results could be adversely affected. For example, we are focused on enhancing the features and functionality of our applications to improve their utility to larger customers with complex, dynamic, and global operations, or we may be required to develop new features, enhancements, or modifications to our products to support our customers’ evolving compliance obligations. Some of our larger customers may also require features and functions unique to their business processes that we do not currently offer. In order to help ensure we meet these requirements, we may devote a significant amount of technology support and professional service resources to such customers. The success of enhancements, new features, and applications depends on several factors, including their timely completion, introduction, and market acceptance as well as access to development resources and the technologies required to build and improve our applications, such as the datasets required to train our machine learning models. If we are not successful in developing these new features, enhancements, modifications, and applications, and bringing them to market timely, it may negatively impact our customer renewal rates, limit the market for our solutions, or impair our ability to attract new customers.
Our growth depends on the success of our strategic relationships with third parties as well as our ability to successfully integrate our applications with a variety of third-party technologies.
We depend on relationships with third parties such as deployment partners, technology and content providers, and other key suppliers, and are also dependent on third parties for the license of certain software and development tools that are incorporated into or used with our applications. If the operations of these third parties are disrupted as a direct or indirect result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, our own operations may suffer, which could adversely impact our operating results. In addition, we rely upon licensed third-party software to help improve our internal systems, processes, and controls. Identifying partners, and negotiating and documenting relationships with them, requires significant time and resources. We may be at a disadvantage if our competitors are effective in providing incentives to third parties to favor their products or services or to prevent or reduce subscriptions to our services, or in negotiating better rates or terms with such third parties. In addition, acquisitions of our partners by our competitors could end our strategic relationship with the acquired partner and result in a decrease in the number of our current and potential customers, or the support services available for third-party technology may be negatively affected by mergers and consolidation in the software industry. If we are unsuccessful in establishing or maintaining our relationships with these third parties, or in monitoring the quality of their products or performance, our ability to compete in the marketplace or to grow our revenues could be impaired and our operating results may suffer.
To the extent that our applications depend upon the successful integration and operation of third-party software in conjunction with our software, any undetected errors or defects in this third-party software, as well as cybersecurity threats or attacks related to such software, could prevent the deployment or impair the functionality of our applications, delay new application introductions, result in a failure of our applications, result in increased costs, including warranty and other related claims from customers, and injure our reputation. Furthermore, software may not continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms. Although we believe that there are commercially reasonable alternatives to the third-party software we currently license, this may not always be the case, or it may be difficult or costly to replace. Integration of new software into our applications may require significant work and require substantial investment of our time and resources.
We also need to continuously modify and enhance our applications to keep pace with changes in third-party internet-related hardware, iOS, Android, other mobile-related technologies, and other third-party software, communication, browser, and database technologies. We must also appropriately balance the application capability demands of our current customers with the capabilities required to address the broader market. Furthermore, uncertainties about the timing and nature of new network platforms or technologies, or modifications to existing platforms or technologies, could increase our product development expenses. Any failure of our applications to operate effectively with future network platforms and other third-party technologies could reduce the demand for our applications, result in customer and end user dissatisfaction, and adversely affect our business and operating results. We may experience difficulties in managing improvements to our systems, processes, and controls or in connection with third-party software, which could materially impair our ability to provide solutions or professional services to our customers in a timely manner, cause us to lose customers, limit us to smaller deployments of our solutions, or increase our technical support costs.
If we are not able to realize a return on the investments we have made toward entering new markets and new lines of business, our business and operating results could be adversely affected.
We continue to seek opportunities to enter into new markets and/or new lines of business, some of which we may have very limited or no experience in. As an entrant to new markets and new lines of business, we may not be effective in convincing prospective customers that our solutions will address their needs, and we may not accurately estimate our infrastructure needs, human resource requirements, or operating expenses with regard to these new markets and new lines of business. We may also fail to accurately anticipate adoption rates of these new lines of business or their underlying technology. For example, machine learning, artificial intelligence, and blockchain are propelling advancements in technology, but if they are not widely adopted and accepted or fail to operate as expected, our business and reputation may be harmed. Also, we may not be able to properly price our solutions in these new markets, which could negatively affect our ability to sell to customers. Furthermore, customers in these new markets or of the new lines of business may demand more features and professional services, which may require us to devote even greater research and development, sales, support, and professional services resources to such customers. If we fail to generate adequate revenue from these new markets and lines of business, or if we fail to do so within the envisioned timeframe, it could have an adverse effect on our business or financial condition.
We are subject to risks associated with our equity investments, including partial or complete loss of invested capital, and significant changes in the fair value of this portfolio could adversely impact our financial results.
We invest in early to late stage companies for strategic reasons and to support key business initiatives, and we may not realize a return on our equity investments. Many such companies generate net losses and the market for their products, services, or technologies may be slow to develop or never materialize. These companies are often dependent on the availability of later rounds of financing from banks or investors on favorable terms to continue their operations. The financial success of our investment in any company is typically dependent on a liquidity event, such as a public offering, acquisition, or other favorable market event reflecting appreciation to the cost of our initial investment. The capital markets for public offerings and acquisitions are dynamic and the likelihood of liquidity events for the companies we have invested in could deteriorate, which could result in a loss of all or a substantial part of our investment in these companies.
Further, valuations of non-marketable equity investments are inherently complex due to the lack of readily available market data. In addition, we may experience additional volatility to our statements of operations due to changes in market prices of our marketable equity investments, the valuation and timing of observable price changes or impairments of our non-marketable equity investments, including impairments to such investments due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and changes in the proportionate share of earnings and losses or impairment of our equity investments accounted for under the equity method. This volatility could be material to our results in any given quarter and may cause our stock price to decline.
Risks Related to Cybersecurity, Data Privacy, and Intellectual Property
If our security measures are breached or unauthorized access to customer or user data is otherwise obtained, our applications may be perceived as not being secure, customers and end users may reduce the use of or stop using our applications, and we may incur significant liabilities.
Our applications involve the storage and transmission of our customers’ sensitive and proprietary information, including personal or identifying information regarding our customers, their employees, customers, and suppliers, as well as financial, accounting, health, and payroll data and other sensitive information. As a result, unauthorized access, acquisition, use, or destruction of this data, or unavailability of data, could expose us to regulatory actions, litigation, investigations, remediation and indemnity obligations, damage to our reputation and brand, supplemental disclosure obligations, loss of customer, consumer, and partner confidence in the security of our applications, destruction of information, an increase in our insurance premiums, impairment to our business, and resulting fees, expenses, loss of revenues, and other potential liabilities. We devote significant financial and personnel resources to implement and maintain security measures. While we have security measures in place that are designed to protect against these risks, preserve the integrity of customer and personal information, and prevent data loss, misappropriation, and other security breaches, our security measures may be compromised as a result of intentional misconduct, including by computer hackers, employees, contractors, or vendors, as well as software bugs, human error, technical malfunctions, or other malfeasance.
Cybersecurity threats and attacks are often targeted at companies such as ours and may take a variety of forms ranging from individuals or groups of hackers, including those who appear to offer a solution to a vulnerability, to sophisticated organizations, including state-sponsored actors. Key cybersecurity risks range from viruses, worms, and other malicious software programs, including phishing attacks or ransomware, to exploitation of software bugs or other defects, to “mega breaches” targeted against cloud services and other hosted software, any of which can result in disclosure of confidential information and intellectual property, defective products, production downtimes, reputational harm, compromised data, and an increase in costs to the business. As the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not identified until they are launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these attacks or to implement adequate preventative measures. There may also be attacks targeting any vulnerabilities in our internally built infrastructure, enhancements, and updates to our existing offerings, or in the many different underlying networks and services that power the internet that our products depend on, most of which are not under our control or the control of our vendors, partners, or customers. Although we have developed systems and processes that are designed to protect our systems, software and data, as well as customer data and other user data, and to prevent data loss and detect security breaches, there can be no assurance that such measures will be effective against all cybersecurity threats or perceived threats.
Additionally, during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, and potentially beyond as remote work and resource access expand, there is an increased risk of cybersecurity-related events such as COVID-19 themed phishing attacks, exploitation of any cybersecurity flaws that may exist, an increase in the number cybersecurity threats or attacks, and other security challenges as a result of most of our employees and our service providers continuing to work remotely from non-corporate managed networks.
Furthermore, we have acquired or partnered with a number of companies, products, services, and technologies over the years, as well as incorporated third-party products, services and technologies into our products and services. Although we devote significant resources to address any known security issues with respect to such acquisitions, partnerships, and incorporated technologies, we may still inherit additional risks when they are integrated within Workday. In addition, if a high-profile security breach occurs with respect to an industry peer, our customers and potential customers may generally lose trust in the security of financial management, spend management, human capital management, planning, or analytics applications, or in cloud applications for enterprises in general. Any or all of these issues could negatively affect our ability to attract new customers, cause existing customers to elect to terminate or not renew their subscriptions, result in reputational damage, cause us to pay remediation and indemnity costs and/or issue service credits or refunds to customers for prepaid and unused subscription services, or result in lawsuits, regulatory fines, or other action or liabilities, which could adversely affect our business and operating results.
In the normal course of business, we are and have been the target of malicious cyber-attack attempts and have experienced other security events. Future cyber-attacks and other security events may have a significant or material impact on our business and operating results.
Privacy concerns and domestic or foreign laws and regulations may reduce the effectiveness of our applications, result in significant costs and compliance challenges, and adversely affect our business and operating results.
Our customers can use our applications to collect, use, and store personal or identifying information regarding a variety of individuals in connection with their operations, including but not limited to their employees, contractors, students, job applicants, customers, and suppliers. Additionally, individuals using our WayToTM by Workday application may store, manage, and share with certain organizations credentials such as employment history, education, skills, and compensation information. National, state and local governments and agencies in the countries in which our customers operate have adopted, are considering adopting, or may adopt laws and regulations regarding the collection, use, storage, transfer, processing, protection, and disclosure of personal information obtained from consumers and individuals, which could impact our ability to offer our services in certain jurisdictions or our customers’ ability to deploy our solutions globally. We have been requested to, and may continue to need to develop features, enhancements, or modifications to our products to support our customers’ evolving compliance obligations. This may require us to divert development and other resources from other areas, incur significant expenditures, or, if we are unsuccessful in delivering these features, enhancements, or modifications, result in monetary damages, loss of revenue or customers, reputational harm, or other adverse impacts to our business.
Privacy and data protection laws are particularly stringent, and the costs of compliance with and other burdens imposed by such laws, regulations, and standards may limit the use and adoption of our services, reduce overall demand for our services, lead to significant fines, penalties, or liabilities for noncompliance, or slow the pace at which we close sales transactions, any of which could harm our business. Even the perception of privacy concerns, whether or not valid, may inhibit the adoption, effectiveness, or use of our applications. Moreover, if we or our subprocessors fail to adhere to adequate data protection practices around the usage of and access to our customers’ and other users’ personal data or fail to report a data breach or other loss of data within timeframes mandated by law or our customer contracts, we may be liable for certain losses, and it may damage our reputation and brand.
Additionally, we expect that existing laws, regulations, and standards may be interpreted in new and differing manners in the future and may be inconsistent among jurisdictions. Future laws, regulations, standards, and other obligations, and changes in the interpretation of existing laws, regulations, standards, and other obligations could result in increased regulation, increased costs of compliance and penalties for non-compliance, and limitations on data collection, use, disclosure, and transfer for Workday and our customers. In 2016, the European Union (“EU”) adopted a new regulation governing data privacy called the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), which became effective in May 2018. The GDPR established new requirements applicable to the handling of personal data and imposes penalties for non-compliance of the greater of €20 million or 4% of worldwide revenue. Customers, particularly in the EU, are seeking assurances from their suppliers, including us, that their processing of personal data of EU nationals is in accordance with the GDPR. If we are unable to provide adequate assurances to such customers, demand for our applications could be adversely affected. In addition, we must continue to seek assurances from our subprocessors that they are handling personal data in accordance with GDPR requirements in order to meet our own obligations under the GDPR. Additionally, the UK implemented the Data Protection Act effective in May 2018 and statutorily amended in 2019, that substantially implements the GDPR and contains provisions, including UK-specific derogations, for how GDPR is applied in the UK. The Data Protection Act also imposes fines of up to the greater of £17 million or 4% of global turnover, in addition to the fines under the GDPR. The UK and the EU reached a Trade Cooperation Agreement in December 2020 that allows continued transfers for a period of up to six months. Beyond that, transfers of data from the European Economic Area to the UK will require use of Standard Contractual Clauses (“SCCs”) absent an EU determination that UK data protection law is “adequate” under EU standards.
In addition, the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) took effect on January 1, 2020, and the California Privacy Rights Act (“CPRA”), which expands upon the CCPA, was passed in the recent California election in November 2020 and comes into effect on January 1, 2023, with a “lookback” period to January 1, 2022. The CCPA and CPRA give California consumers certain rights similar to those provided by the GDPR, and customers and other users may seek similar assurances from suppliers regarding compliance. Moreover, there are a number of other legislative proposals worldwide, including in the United States at both the federal and state level, that could impose additional and potentially conflicting obligations in areas affecting our business.
In addition to government activity, privacy advocacy and other industry groups have established or may establish various new, additional, or different self-regulatory standards that may place additional burdens on us. Our customers may expect us to meet voluntary certifications or adhere to other standards established by third parties. If we are unable to maintain these certifications or meet these standards, it could reduce demand for our applications and adversely affect our business and operating results.
The costs of compliance with, and other burdens imposed by, privacy laws and regulations that are applicable to the businesses of our customers may adversely affect our customers’ ability and willingness to process, handle, store, use, and transmit demographic and personal data, which in turn could limit the use, effectiveness, and adoption of our applications and reduce overall demand. In addition, the other bases on which we and our customers rely for the transfer of data, such as model contracts, continue to be subjected to regulatory and judicial scrutiny. In July 2020, the Court of Justice of the European Union invalidated the Privacy Shield framework for data transferred from the European Economic Area to the United States. While the same court upheld the use of SCCs, which we offer to our customers to enable data transfers, the decision has led to some uncertainty regarding the use of SCCs as the mechanism for data transfers to the United States and the court made clear that reliance on SCCs alone may not necessarily be sufficient in all circumstances. Use of SCCs must now be assessed on a case-by-case basis, taking into account the legal regime applicable in the destination country. In November 2020, the European Data Protection Board issued draft recommendations, which may impose higher burdens on the use of SCCs for cross-border data transfers, including transfers to cloud service providers, and create challenging technical issues. To comply with these recommendations, we may need to implement additional contractual and technical safeguards for any personal data transferred out of the European Economic Area, which could increase our compliance costs, expose us to further regulatory scrutiny and liability, and adversely affect our business. At the same time in November 2020, the European Commission released a draft of revised SCCs. If adopted, these could make aspects of contracting around cross-border transfers easier, particularly in relation to use of subprocessors. Ultimately, if we or our customers are unable to transfer data between and among countries and regions in which we operate, it could decrease demand for our applications, require us to restrict our business operations, and impair our ability to maintain and grow our customer base and increase our revenue.
Any failure to protect our intellectual property rights domestically and internationally could impair our ability to protect our proprietary technology and our brand.
Our success and ability to compete depend in part upon our intellectual property. We rely on patent, copyright, trade secret and trademark laws, trade secret protection, and confidentiality or license agreements with our employees, customers, suppliers, partners, and others to protect our intellectual property rights. However, the steps we take to protect our intellectual property rights may be inadequate. While we have patent applications pending in the United States and throughout the world, we may be unable to obtain patent protection for the technology covered in our patent applications. In addition, any patents issued to us in the future may not provide us with competitive advantages or may be successfully challenged by third parties. Furthermore, legal standards relating to the validity, enforceability, and scope of protection of intellectual property rights are uncertain. Despite our precautions, it may be possible for unauthorized third parties, including those affiliated with state-sponsored actors, to copy or reverse engineer our applications, including with the assistance of insiders, and use information that we regard as proprietary to create products and services that compete with ours. Some license provisions protecting against unauthorized use, copying, transfer, and disclosure of our technology may be unenforceable under the laws of jurisdictions outside the United States. In addition, the laws of some countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States.
We enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and consultants and enter into confidentiality agreements with the parties with whom we have strategic relationships and business alliances. No assurance can be given that these agreements will be effective in controlling access to and distribution of our applications and proprietary information. Further, these agreements do not prevent our competitors or partners from independently developing technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our applications.
We may be required to spend significant resources to monitor and protect our intellectual property rights. Litigation brought to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights could be costly, time-consuming, and distracting to management and could result in the impairment or loss of portions of our intellectual property. Furthermore, our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights may be met with defenses, counterclaims, and countersuits attacking the validity and enforceability of our intellectual property rights. Our failure to secure, protect, and enforce our intellectual property rights could have a serious adverse effect on our brand and business.
We may be sued by third parties for alleged infringement of their proprietary rights.
There is considerable patent and other intellectual property development activity in our industry. Our competitors, as well as a number of other entities and individuals, may own or claim to own intellectual property relating to our industry. From time to time, third parties may claim that our applications and underlying technology infringe or violate their intellectual property rights, even if we are unaware of the intellectual property rights that others may claim cover some or all of our technology or services, and we may be found to be infringing such rights. Any claims or litigation could cause us to incur significant expenses and, if successfully asserted against us, could require that we pay substantial damages or ongoing royalty payments, prevent us from offering our services, require us to change our products, technology, or business practices, or require that we comply with other unfavorable terms. We may also be obligated to indemnify our customers or business partners or pay substantial settlement costs, including royalty payments, in connection with any such claim or litigation and to obtain licenses, modify applications, or refund fees, which could be costly. In addition, we may be sued by third parties who seek to target us for actions taken by our customers, including through the use or misuse of our products. Even if we were to prevail in an intellectual property dispute, any litigation regarding our intellectual property could be costly and time-consuming and divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations. Furthermore, from time to time we may introduce or acquire new products, including in areas where we historically have not competed, which could increase our exposure to patent and other intellectual property claims.
Some of our applications utilize open source software, and any failure to comply with the terms of one or more of these open source licenses could negatively affect our business.
Some of our applications include software covered by open source licenses, which may include, by way of example, GNU General Public License and the Apache License. The terms of various open source licenses have not been interpreted by United States courts, and there is a risk that such licenses could be construed in a manner that imposes unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to market our applications. We attempt to avoid adverse licensing conditions in our use of open source software in our products and services. However, there can be no assurance that our efforts have been or will be successful. By the terms of certain open source licenses, we could be required to release the source code of our proprietary software, and to make our proprietary software available under open source licenses, if we combine our proprietary software with open source software in a certain manner. In the event that portions of our proprietary software are determined to be impacted by an open source license, we could be required to publicly release the affected portions of our source code, re-engineer all or a portion of our technologies, or otherwise be limited in the licensing of our technologies, each of which could reduce or eliminate the value of our technologies and services. In addition to risks related to license requirements, usage of open source software can lead to greater risks than use of third-party commercial software, as open source licensors generally do not provide warranties or controls on the origin of the software. Many of the risks associated with usage of open source software cannot be eliminated and could negatively affect our business.
Risks Related to Legal and Regulatory Matters
Unfavorable laws, regulations, interpretive positions or standards governing new and evolving technologies that we incorporate into our products and services could result in significant cost and compliance challenges and adversely affect our business and operating results.
Some of our products and services, such as Workday’s People Experience and Talent Optimization product suites, currently utilize or will utilize new and evolving technologies such as machine learning, artificial intelligence, and blockchain. While existing laws and regulations may apply to these types of technologies, the overall regulatory environment governing these types of technologies is still currently undeveloped and likely to evolve as government interest in these technologies increases. Regulation of these technologies, as well as other technologies that we utilize in our products and services, also varies greatly among international, federal, state, and local jurisdictions and is subject to significant uncertainty. Governments and agencies domestic and abroad may in the future change or amend existing laws, or adopt new laws, regulations, or guidance, or take other actions which may severely impact the permitted uses of our technologies. Any failure by us to comply with applicable laws, regulations, guidance, or other rules could result in costly litigation, penalties, or fines. In addition, these regulations and any related enforcement actions could establish and further expand our obligations to customers, individuals, and other third parties with respect to our products and services, limit the countries in which such products and services may be used, restrict the way we structure and operate our business, require us to divert development and other resources, and reduce the types of customers and individuals who can use our products and services. Increased regulation and oversight of products or services which utilize or rely on these technologies may result in costly compliance burdens or otherwise increase our operating costs, detrimentally affecting our business. These new technologies could subject us to additional litigation brought by private parties, which could be costly, time-consuming, and distracting to management and could result in substantial expenses and losses.
In addition, as with many innovations, machine learning and artificial intelligence present additional risks and challenges that could affect their adoption and therefore our business. For example, the development of machine learning and artificial intelligence present emerging ethical issues, and if we enable or offer solutions on this front that are controversial, due to their impact, or perceived impact, on human rights, privacy, employment, or in other social contexts, we may experience brand or reputational harm, competitive harm, or legal liability. Also, our positions on social and ethical issues may impact our ability to attract or retain customers and other users. In particular, our brand and reputation are associated with our public commitments to sustainability, equality, inclusivity, accessibility, and ethical use, and any perceived changes in our dedication to these commitments could impact our relationships with potential and current customers and other users.
We are subject to risks related to government contracts and related procurement regulations, which may adversely impact our business and operating results.
Our contracts with federal, state, local, and foreign government entities are subject to various procurement regulations and other requirements relating to their formation, administration, performance, and termination, which could adversely impact our business and operating results. These laws and regulations provide public sector customers various rights, many of which are not typically found in commercial contracts. For instance, these regulations may require the certification and disclosure of cost and pricing data and other sensitive information in connection with contract negotiations under certain contract types. Any public disclosure of such information may adversely impact our competitive position and our operating results. We may be subject to audits and investigations relating to our government contracts, and any violations could result in various civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of contracts, refunding or suspending of payments, forfeiture of profits, payment of fines, and suspension or debarment from future government business. In addition, such contracts may provide for delays, interruptions, or termination by the government at any time, without cause, which activities may adversely affect our business and operating results and impact other existing or prospective government contracts.
We may not be able to utilize a portion of our net operating loss or research tax credit carryforwards, which could adversely affect our profitability.
As of January 31, 2021, we had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards due to prior period losses. If not utilized, the pre-fiscal 2018 federal and the state net operating loss carryforwards expire in varying amounts between fiscal 2022, and 2041. The federal net operating losses generated in and after fiscal 2018 do not expire and may be carried forward indefinitely. We also have federal research tax credit carryforwards, which if not utilized will begin to expire in fiscal 2022. These net operating loss and research tax credit carryforwards could expire unused and be unavailable to reduce future income tax liabilities, which could adversely affect our profitability. In addition, under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, our ability to utilize net operating loss carryforwards or other tax attributes, such as research tax credits, in any taxable year may be limited if we experience an “ownership change.” A Section 382 “ownership change” generally occurs if one or more stockholders or groups of stockholders who own at least 5% of our stock increase their ownership by more than 50 percentage points over their lowest ownership percentage within a rolling three-year period. Similar rules may apply under state tax laws. It is possible that an ownership change, or any future ownership change, could have a material effect on the use of our net operating loss carryforwards or other tax attributes, which could adversely affect our profitability.
Unanticipated tax laws or any change in the application of existing tax laws to us or our customers, especially those limiting our ability to utilize our net operating loss and research tax credit carryforwards, may increase the costs of our services and adversely impact our profitability and business.
We operate and are subject to taxes in the United States and numerous other jurisdictions throughout the world. Changes to federal, state, local, or international tax laws on income, sales, use, indirect, or other tax laws, statutes, rules, regulations, or ordinances on multinational corporations are currently being considered by the United States and other countries where we do business. These contemplated legislative initiatives include, but are not limited to, changes to transfer pricing policies and definitional changes to permanent establishment that could be applied solely or disproportionately to services provided over the internet. These contemplated tax initiatives, if finalized and adopted by countries, may ultimately impact our effective tax rate and could adversely affect our sales activity resulting in a negative impact on our operating results and cash flows.
In addition, existing tax laws, statutes, rules, regulations, or ordinances could be interpreted, changed, modified, or applied adversely to us (possibly with retroactive effect), which could require us to pay additional tax amounts, fines or penalties, and interest for past amounts. Existing tax laws, statutes, rules, regulations, or ordinances could also be interpreted, changed, modified, or applied adversely to our customers (possibly with retroactive effect), which could require our customers to pay additional tax amounts with respect to services we have provided, fines or penalties, and interest for past amounts. If we are unsuccessful in collecting such taxes from our customers, we could be held liable for such costs, thereby adversely impacting our operating results and cash flows. If our customers must pay additional fines or penalties, it could adversely affect demand for our services.
As of January 31, 2021, we had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards due to prior period losses. If not utilized, the pre-fiscal 2018 federal and the state net operating loss carryforwards expire in varying amounts between fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2041. The federal net operating losses generated in and after fiscal 2018 do not expire and may be carried forward indefinitely. We also have federal research tax credit carryforwards, which if not utilized will begin to expire in fiscal 2022. These net operating loss and research tax credit carryforwards could expire unused and be unavailable to reduce future income tax liabilities, which could adversely affect our profitability. In addition, under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, our ability to utilize net operating loss carryforwards or other tax attributes, such as research tax credits, in any taxable year may be limited if we experience an “ownership change.” A Section 382 “ownership change” generally occurs if one or more stockholders or groups of stockholders who own at least 5% of our stock increase their ownership by more than 50 percentage points over their lowest ownership percentage within a rolling three-year period. Similar rules may apply under state tax laws. It is possible that an ownership change, or any future ownership change, could have a material effect on the use of our net operating loss carryforwards or other tax attributes, which could adversely affect our profitability.
Risks Related to Financial Matters
Our historic revenue growth rates should not be viewed as indicative of our future performance.
Our revenue growth rates have declined and may decline again in the future as the size of our customer base and market penetration increases. In addition, our future rate of growth is subject to a number of uncertainties, including general economic and market conditions, including those caused by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, as well as risks associated with growing companies in rapidly changing industries. Other factors may also contribute to declines in our growth rates, including slowing demand for our services, increasing competition, a decrease in the growth of our overall market, our failure to continue to capitalize on growth opportunities, and the maturation of our business, some of which may be magnified by the COVID-19 pandemic. As our growth rates decline, investors’ perceptions of our business and the trading price of our securities could be adversely affected.
Additionally, our ability to accurately forecast our future rate of growth is limited. It is difficult to predict customer and other user adoption rates and demand for our applications, the future growth rate and size of the cloud computing market for our services, or the entry of competitive applications. Moreover, it has been and, until the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic are contained, will continue to be, even more difficult for us to forecast our operating results. We plan our expense levels and investments on estimates of future revenue and anticipated rates of growth. If our growth does not meet estimates, we may not be able to adjust our spending quickly enough to avoid an adverse impact on our financial results as a consequence of spending that is not aligned with our actual performance.
Moreover, we have encountered and will encounter risks and uncertainties frequently experienced by growing companies in rapidly changing industries, including the risks and uncertainties described herein. If our assumptions regarding these risks and uncertainties (which we use to plan our business) are incorrect or change due to changes in our markets, or if we do not address these risks successfully, our operating and financial results could differ materially from our expectations and our business could suffer.
Because we encounter long sales cycles when selling to large customers and we recognize subscription services revenue over the term of the contract, downturns or upturns in new sales will not be immediately reflected in our operating results and may be difficult to discern.
We generally recognize subscription services revenue over time as services are delivered to the customer, which typically occurs over a period of three years or longer. As a result, most of the subscription services revenue we report in each quarter is derived from the recognition of unearned revenue relating to subscriptions entered into during previous quarters. Consequently, a decline in new or renewed subscription contracts in any single quarter will likely have a minor impact on our revenue results for that quarter. However, such a decline will negatively affect our revenue in future quarters. Additionally, because much of our sales efforts are targeted at large enterprise customers, our sales cycles involve greater costs, longer sales cycles, the provision of greater levels of education regarding the use and benefits of our applications, less predictability in completing some of our sales, and varying deployment timeframes based on many factors including the number, type, and configuration of applications being deployed, the complexity, scale, and geographic dispersion of the customers’ business and operations, the number of integrations with other systems, and other factors, many of which are beyond our control.
Our typical sales cycles are six to twelve months but can extend for eighteen months or more, including as a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, and we expect that this lengthy sales cycle may continue or expand as customers increasingly adopt our applications beyond HCM. Longer sales cycles could cause our operating and financial results to suffer in a given period. Accordingly, the effect of significant downturns in sales and market acceptance of our applications, as well as potential changes in our pricing policies or rate of renewals, may not be fully reflected in our operating results until future periods. Additionally, we may be unable to adjust our cost structure to reflect any such changes in revenue. In addition, a majority of our costs are expensed as incurred, while revenue is recognized over the life of the customer agreement. As a result, increased growth in the number of our customers could result in our recognition of more costs than revenue in the earlier periods of the terms of our agreements. Our subscription model also makes it difficult for us to rapidly increase our revenue through additional sales in any period, as subscription services revenue from new customers generally is recognized over the applicable subscription term. Furthermore, our subscription-based model is largely based on the size of our customers’ employee headcount. Therefore, the addition or loss of employees by our customers, including any significant reductions in force by our customers during the COVID-19 pandemic, or customer insolvencies resulting from severe economic hardship during the COVID-19 pandemic, could have an impact on our subscription services revenue in any given period. Although we have downside protection in our customer agreements in the form of base minimums, should there be any prolonged decrease in our customers’ headcounts, we could experience reduced subscription services revenue upon renewal or potentially outside of the renewal period, which could materially impact our business and operating results in any given period.
We have a history of cumulative net losses, and we do not expect to be profitable on a GAAP basis for the foreseeable future.
We have incurred significant net losses on a GAAP basis in each period since our inception in 2005. These net losses and our accumulated deficit reflect the substantial investments we make to acquire new customers and develop our applications. We expect our operating expenses to increase in the future due to anticipated increases in sales and marketing expenses, product development expenses, operations costs, and general and administrative costs, and therefore we expect our net losses on a GAAP basis to continue for the foreseeable future. If we fail to grow our revenue sufficiently to keep pace with our investments and operating expenses, our results of operations and financial condition would be adversely affected. In addition, we may encounter difficulties, delays, and other unpredictable factors that may result in unanticipated operating expenses. Furthermore, to the extent we are successful in increasing our customer base, we also expect to incur increased net losses in the acquisition period because costs associated with acquiring customers are generally incurred up front, while subscription services revenue is generally recognized ratably over the terms of the agreements, which are typically three years or longer. We cannot ensure that we will achieve GAAP profitability in the future or that, if we do become profitable, we will sustain profitability.
We have substantial indebtedness which may adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.
In September 2017, we completed an offering of $1.15 billion of 0.25% convertible senior notes due October 1, 2022 (“2022 Notes”). As a result of this offering, we incurred $1.15 billion principal amount of indebtedness, which we may be required to pay at maturity in 2022, or upon the occurrence of a fundamental change (as defined in the Indenture by and between us and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as Trustee (“Indenture”)). In addition, in April 2020, we entered into a credit agreement (“Credit Agreement”) that provided for a term loan in an aggregate original principal amount of $750 million (“Term Loan”) and a revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of $750 million (“Revolving Credit Facility”).
We may incur substantial additional debt in the future, some of which may be secured debt. There can be no assurance that we will be able to repay this indebtedness when due, or that we will be able to refinance this indebtedness on acceptable terms or at all. Our ability to pay cash upon conversion or repurchase of the 2022 Notes may be limited by law, regulatory authority, or agreements governing our future indebtedness and is dependent on our future performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive, and other factors beyond our control. Any future debt may also contain limitations on our ability to pay cash upon a conversion request or repurchase upon a fundamental change.
In addition, our indebtedness could, among other things:
•make it difficult for us to pay other obligations;
•make it difficult to obtain favorable terms for any necessary future financing for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, or other purposes;
•adversely affect our liquidity and result in a material adverse effect on our financial position upon repayment of the indebtedness;
•require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to service and repay the indebtedness, reducing the amount of cash flow available for other purposes;
•limit our flexibility in planning for and reacting to changes in our business; and
•negatively impact our credit rating, which could limit our ability to obtain additional financing in the future and adversely affect our business.
Our Credit Agreement also imposes restrictions on us and requires us to maintain compliance with specified covenants, including a specific leverage ratio. Our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond our control. If we breach any of the covenants and do not obtain a waiver from the lenders, then, subject to applicable cure periods, any outstanding indebtedness may be declared immediately due and payable. Any required repayment of our debt under the Credit Agreement as a result of a fundamental change or other acceleration would lower our current cash on hand such that we would not have those funds available for use in our business.
Our convertible note hedge and warrant transactions may affect the value of our Class A common stock.
In connection with the sale of our convertible notes, we entered into convertible note hedge transactions with institutions that we refer to as the option counterparties. We also entered into warrant transactions with the option counterparties pursuant to which we sold warrants for the purchase of our Class A common stock. The convertible note hedge transactions are expected to offset the potential dilution to our Class A common stock upon any conversion of the convertible notes. The warrant transactions could separately have a dilutive effect to the extent that the market price per share of our Class A common stock exceeds the exercise price of the relevant warrants.
The option counterparties or their respective affiliates may modify their hedge positions by entering into or unwinding various derivatives with respect to our Class A common stock and/or purchasing or selling our Class A common stock or other securities of ours in secondary market transactions prior to the maturity of the convertible notes. This activity could suppress or inflate the market price of our Class A common stock.
We will also be subject to the risk that these option counterparties may default under the convertible note hedge transactions. Our exposure to the credit risk of the option counterparties will not be secured by any collateral. If one or more of the option counterparties to one or more of our convertible note hedge transactions becomes subject to insolvency proceedings, we will become an unsecured creditor in those proceedings with a claim equal to our exposure at the time under those transactions. Our exposure will depend on many factors but, generally, the increase in our exposure will be correlated to the increase in the market price of our Class A common stock during the related settlement period. In addition, upon a default by one of the option counterparties, we may suffer dilution with respect to our Class A common stock as well as adverse financial consequences.
Risks Related to Ownership of Our Class A Common Stock
Our Chairman and a co-CEO have control over key decision making as a result of their control of a majority of our voting stock.
As of January 31, 2021, our co-founder and Chairman David Duffield, together with his affiliates, held voting rights with respect to approximately 49 million shares of Class B common stock and 0.5 million shares of Class A common stock. As of January 31, 2021, our co-founder and co-CEO Aneel Bhusri, together with his affiliates, held voting rights with respect to approximately 8 million shares of Class B common stock and 0.3 million shares of Class A common stock. In addition, Mr. Bhusri holds 0.1 million restricted stock units (“RSUs”), which will be settled in an equivalent number of shares of Class A common stock. Further, Messrs. Duffield and Bhusri have entered into a voting agreement under which each has granted a voting proxy with respect to certain Class B common stock beneficially owned by him effective upon his death or incapacity as described in our registration statement on Form S-1 filed in connection with our initial public offering. Messrs. Duffield and Bhusri have each initially designated the other as their respective proxies. Accordingly, upon the death or incapacity of either Mr. Duffield or Mr. Bhusri, the other would individually continue to control the voting of shares subject to the voting proxy. Collectively, the shares described above represent a substantial majority of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock. As a result, Messrs. Duffield and Bhusri have the ability to control the outcome of matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, including the election of directors and any merger, consolidation, or sale of all or substantially all of our assets. In addition, they have the ability to control the management and affairs of our company as a result of their positions as our Chairman and co-CEO, respectively, and their ability to control the election of our directors. Mr. Duffield, in his capacity as a board member, and Mr. Bhusri, in his capacity as a board member and officer, each owe a fiduciary duty to our stockholders and must act in good faith in a manner they reasonably believe to be in the best interests of our stockholders. As stockholders, even as controlling stockholders, they are entitled to vote their shares in their own interests, which may not always be in the interests of our stockholders generally.
The dual class structure of our common stock has the effect of concentrating voting control with our Chairman and a co-CEO, as well as with other executive officers, directors, and affiliates, which limits or precludes the ability of non-affiliates to influence corporate matters.
Our Class B common stock has 10 votes per share and our Class A common stock, which is the stock that is publicly traded, has one vote per share. Stockholders who hold shares of Class B common stock, including our executive officers, directors, and other affiliates, together hold a substantial majority of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock as of January 31, 2021. Because of the ten-to-one voting ratio between our Class B and Class A common stock, the holders of our Class B common stock collectively will continue to control a majority of the combined voting power of our common stock and therefore be able to control all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval until the conversion of all shares of all Class A and Class B shares to a single class of common stock on the date that is the first to occur of (i) October 17, 2032, (ii) such time as the shares of Class B common stock represent less than 9% of the outstanding Class A and Class B common stock, (iii) nine months following the death of both Mr. Duffield and Mr. Bhusri, or (iv) the date on which the holders of a majority of the shares of Class B common stock elect to convert all shares of Class A common stock and Class B common stock into a single class of common stock. This concentrated control will limit or preclude the ability of non-affiliates to influence corporate matters for the foreseeable future.
Future transfers by holders of Class B common stock will generally result in those shares converting to Class A common stock, subject to limited exceptions, such as certain transfers effected for estate planning purposes. The conversion of Class B common stock to Class A common stock will have the effect, over time, of increasing the relative voting power of those holders of Class B common stock who retain their shares in the long term. If, for example, Mr. Duffield and Mr. Bhusri retain a significant portion of their holdings of Class B common stock for an extended period of time, they could, in the future, continue to control a majority of the combined voting power of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock.
Our stock price has been volatile in the past and may be subject to volatility in the future.
The trading price of our Class A common stock has historically been volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors such as those described below. These factors, as well as the volatility of our Class A common stock, could also impact the price of our convertible senior notes. Further, the trading price of our Class A common stock has fluctuated significantly and may continue to fluctuate as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and associated economic downturn. Additional risk factors that may affect the trading price of our securities, some of which are beyond our control and further magnified by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, include:
•overall performance of the equity markets;
•fluctuations in the valuation of companies perceived by investors to be comparable to us, such as high-growth or cloud companies, or in valuation metrics, such as our price to revenues ratio;
•guidance, as well as our ability to give guidance, as to our operating results and other financial metrics that we provide to the public, differences between our guidance and market expectations, our failure to meet our guidance, any withdrawal of previous guidance or changes from our historical guidance;
•the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business, and whether analysts who cover us downgrade our Class A common stock or publish unfavorable or inaccurate research about our business;
•variations in, and limitations of, the various financial and other metrics and modeling used by analysts in their research and reports about our business;
•announcements of technological innovations, new applications or enhancements to services, acquisitions, strategic alliances, or significant agreements by us or by our competitors;
•announcements of negative corporate developments by us or by our competitors and other high-growth or cloud companies including, among other things, any announcements related to security incidents;
•disruptions in our services due to computer hardware, software, or network problems;
•announcements of customer additions and customer cancellations or delays in customer purchases;
•recruitment or departure of key personnel;
•the economy as a whole, political and regulatory uncertainty, and market conditions in our industry and the industries of our customers;
•trading activity by directors, executive officers, and significant stockholders, or the perception in the market that the holders of a large number of shares intend to sell their shares;
•the exercise of rights held by certain of our stockholders, subject to some conditions, to require us to file registration statements covering their shares or to include their shares in registration statements that we may file for ourselves or our stockholders;
•the size of our market float and significant stock option exercises;
•any future issuances of our securities;
•environmental, social, governance, ethical, and other issues impacting our brand;
•sales and purchases of any Class A common stock issued upon conversion of our convertible senior notes or in connection with the convertible note hedge and warrant transactions related to such convertible senior notes;
•our operating performance and the performance of other similar companies; and
•the sale or availability for sale of a large number of shares of our Class A common stock in the public market.
Additionally, the stock markets have at times experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected and may in the future affect the market prices of equity securities of many companies. These fluctuations have, in some cases, been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies. Further, the trading prices of publicly traded shares of companies in our industry have been particularly volatile and may be very volatile in the future.
In the past, some companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been subject to securities class action litigation. We may be the target of this type of litigation in the future. Securities litigation against us could result in substantial costs and divert our management’s attention from other business concerns, which could harm our business.
Delaware law and provisions in our restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws could make a merger, tender offer, or proxy contest difficult, thereby depressing the market price of our Class A common stock.
Our status as a Delaware corporation and the anti-takeover provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law (“DGCL”) may discourage, delay, or prevent a change in control by prohibiting us from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years after the person becomes an interested stockholder, even if a change of control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders. In addition, our restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that may make the acquisition of Workday more difficult, including the following:
•any transaction that would result in a change in control of our company requires the approval of a majority of our outstanding Class B common stock voting as a separate class;
•our dual class common stock structure, which provides our co-founders with the ability to control the outcome of matters requiring stockholder approval, even if they own significantly less than a majority of the shares of our outstanding Class A and Class B common stock;
•our Board of Directors is classified into three classes of directors with staggered three-year terms and directors are only able to be removed from office for cause;
•when the outstanding shares of our Class B common stock represent less than a majority of the combined voting power of common stock:
◦certain amendments to our restated certificate of incorporation or amended and restated bylaws will require the approval of two-thirds of the combined vote of our then-outstanding shares of Class A and Class B common stock;
◦our stockholders will only be able to take action at a meeting of stockholders and not by written consent; and
◦vacancies on our Board of Directors will be able to be filled only by our Board of Directors and not by stockholders;
•only our chairman of the board, co-chief executive officers, president, or a majority of our Board of Directors are authorized to call a special meeting of stockholders;
•certain litigation against us can only be brought in Delaware;
•we will have two classes of common stock until the date that is the first to occur of (i) October 17, 2032, (ii) such time as the shares of Class B common stock represent less than 9% of the outstanding Class A and Class B common stock, (iii) nine months following the death of both Mr. Duffield and Mr. Bhusri, or (iv) the date on which the holders of a majority of the shares of Class B common stock elect to convert all shares of Class A common stock and Class B common stock into a single class of common stock;
•our restated certificate of incorporation authorizes undesignated preferred stock, the terms of which may be established, and shares of which may be issued, without the approval of the holders of Class A common stock; and
•advance notice procedures apply for stockholders to nominate candidates for election as directors or to bring matters before an annual meeting of stockholders.
In addition, Section 203 of the DGCL imposes certain restrictions on mergers, business combinations, and other transactions between us and holders of 15% or more of our common stock, which may discourage, delay, or prevent a change in control of our company.
These anti-takeover defenses could discourage, delay, or prevent a transaction involving a change in control of our company. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for stockholders to elect directors of their choosing and to cause us to take other corporate actions they desire, any of which, under certain circumstances, could depress the market price of our securities.
The exclusive forum provision in our organizational documents may limit a stockholder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or any of our directors, officers, or other employees, which may discourage lawsuits with respect to such claims.
Our restated certificate of incorporation, to the fullest extent permitted by law, provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the exclusive forum for: any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf; any action asserting a breach of fiduciary duty; any action asserting a claim against us arising pursuant to the DGCL, our restated certificate of incorporation, or our amended and restated bylaws; or any action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine. There is uncertainty as to whether a court would enforce this exclusive forum provision with respect to claims under the Securities Act. If a court were to find the choice of forum provisions contained in our restated certificate of incorporation to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.
In April 2020, we amended and restated our bylaws to provide that the federal district courts of the United States of America will, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act (“Federal Forum Provision”). Our decision to adopt a Federal Forum Provision followed a decision by the Supreme Court of the State of Delaware holding that such provisions are facially valid under Delaware law. While there can be no assurance that federal or state courts will follow the holding of the Delaware Supreme Court or determine that the Federal Forum Provision should be enforced in a particular case, application of the Federal Forum Provision means that suits brought by our stockholders to enforce any duty or liability created by the Securities Act must be brought in federal court and cannot be brought in state court.
In addition, neither the exclusive forum provision nor the Federal Forum Provision applies to suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Exchange Act. Accordingly, actions by our stockholders to enforce any duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or the rules and regulations thereunder must be brought in federal court, and our stockholders will not be deemed to have waived our compliance with the federal securities laws and the regulations promulgated thereunder.
Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring or holding any interest in any of our securities shall be deemed to have notice of and consented to our exclusive forum provisions, including the Federal Forum Provision. These provisions may limit a stockholders’ ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum of their choosing for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or other employees, which may discourage lawsuits against us and our directors, officers, and other employees.
We do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future.
We have never declared nor paid cash dividends on our capital stock. We currently intend to retain any future earnings to finance the operation and expansion of our business, and we do not expect to declare or pay any dividends in the foreseeable future. Consequently, stockholders must rely on sales of their common stock after price appreciation as the only way to realize any future gains on their investment.
General Risk Factors
Adverse economic conditions may negatively impact our business.
Our business depends on the overall demand for enterprise software and on the economic health of our current and prospective customers. Any significant weakening of the economy in the United States or abroad, limited availability of credit, reduction in business confidence and activity, decreased government spending, or economic uncertainty, all of which are being impacted by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, and its effects such as unemployment, may continue to affect one or more of the sectors or countries in which we sell our applications. These economic conditions can arise suddenly, as did the conditions associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, and the full impact of such conditions can be difficult to predict. In addition, geopolitical and domestic political developments, such as existing and potential trade wars and other events beyond our control, can increase levels of political and economic unpredictability globally and increase the volatility of global financial markets, as has been the case with the COVID-19 pandemic. Alternatively, a strong dollar could reduce demand for our applications and services in countries with relatively weaker currencies.
Also, Brexit has created economic and political uncertainty, including volatility in the value of foreign currencies. While the UK and the EU reached a Trade Cooperation Agreement in December 2020, the impact of Brexit depends on the implementation of this agreement, as well as the terms of the UK’s future trade agreements with other countries and such impact may not be fully realized for several years or more. This uncertainty may cause some of our customers or potential customers to curtail spending and may ultimately result in new regulatory, operational, and cost challenges to our UK and global operations.
These adverse conditions could continue to result in reductions in sales of our applications, longer sales cycles, reductions in subscription duration and value, customer bankruptcies, slower adoption of new technologies, and increased price competition. Any of these events would likely have an adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial position.
Catastrophic events may disrupt our business.
Our corporate headquarters are located in Pleasanton, California, and we have data centers located in the United States, Canada, Europe, and Asia. The west coast of the United States contains active earthquake zones and the southeast is subject to seasonal hurricanes or other extreme weather conditions. Additionally, we rely on internal technology systems, our website, and our network and third-party infrastructure and enterprise applications, which are located in a wide variety of regions, for our development, marketing, operational support, hosted services, and sales activities. In the event of a major earthquake, hurricane, or other natural disaster, or a catastrophic event such as fire, power loss, telecommunications failure, vandalism, civil unrest, cyber-attack, geopolitical instability, war, terrorist attack, insurrection, pandemics or other public health emergencies (including the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic), or the effects of climate change (such as drought, flooding, wildfires, increased storm severity, and sea level rise), we may be unable to continue our operations and may endure system interruptions, delays in our product development, lengthy interruptions in our services, breaches of data security, and loss of critical data, all of which could cause reputational harm or otherwise have an adverse effect on our business and operating results.
We may discover weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting, which may adversely affect investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports and consequently the market price of our securities.
As a public company, we are required to design and maintain proper and effective internal controls over financial reporting and to report any material weaknesses in such internal controls. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires that we evaluate and determine the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting and provide a management report on the internal controls over financial reporting, which must be attested to by our independent registered public accounting firm. If we have a material weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting, we may not detect errors on a timely basis and our financial statements may be materially misstated.
The process of compiling the system and processing documentation necessary to perform the evaluation needed to comply with Section 404 is challenging and costly. In the future, we may not be able to complete our evaluation, testing, and any required remediation in a timely fashion. If we identify material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting, if we are unable to comply with the requirements of Section 404 in a timely manner, if we are unable to assert that our internal controls over financial reporting are effective, or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to express an opinion as to the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports and the market price of our securities could be negatively affected, and we could become subject to investigations by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, the SEC, or other regulatory authorities, which could require additional financial and management resources. In addition, because we use Workday’s financial management application, any problems that we experience with financial reporting and compliance could be negatively perceived by prospective or current customers, and negatively impact demand for our applications.","ITEM 1B.

Our corporate headquarters, which includes operations and product development facilities, is located in Pleasanton, California. It consists of approximately 516,000 square feet of leased facilities, 677,000 square feet of owned facilities, and a 6.9 acre parcel of leased land. The land lease will expire in 2108. In addition, we lease office space in various locations, including North America, Europe, and Asia Pacific, and data center capacity throughout North America and Europe.
We lease certain office space within our corporate headquarters from an affiliate of our Chairman, Mr. Duffield. We obtained independent evaluations of current market rates at the time of lease negotiations with the goal of leasing at a rate comparable to the current market price. During fiscal 2021, we entered into an agreement with this affiliated party for a fee of $1.5 million for an option to purchase these leased facilities at a price based on third-party appraisals and negotiation between Workday and the affiliated party (the “Leased Property Purchase Option”). On February 23, 2021, our Board of Directors approved the exercise of the Leased Property Purchase Option. The purchase of these leased facilities is expected to be completed in the first quarter of fiscal 2022. For further information, see Note 12, Leases, and Note 22, Subsequent Events, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.","ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
We are regularly involved with claims, suits, regulatory and government investigations, and other proceedings involving competition, intellectual property, data security and privacy, tax and related compliance, labor and employment, commercial disputes, and other matters. Such claims, suits, regulatory and government investigations, and other proceedings can impose a significant burden on management and employees, could prevent us from offering one or more of our applications, services, or features to others, could require us to change our technology or business practices, or could result in monetary damages, fines, civil or criminal penalties, reputational harm, or other adverse consequences.
These claims, suits, regulatory and government investigations, and other proceedings may include speculative, substantial, or indeterminate monetary amounts. We record a liability when we believe that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Significant judgment is required to determine both the likelihood of there being a liability and the estimated amount of a liability related to such matters. With respect to our outstanding matters, based on our current knowledge, we believe that the amount or range of reasonably possible liability will not, either individually or in aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, cash flows, or financial condition. However, the outcome of such matters is inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties.","ITEM 4. MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES

Overview
Workday delivers financial management, spend management, human capital management, planning, and analytics and benchmarking applications designed for the world’s largest companies, educational institutions, and government agencies. With Workday, our customers have a unified system that can help them plan, execute, analyze, and extend to other applications and environments, thereby helping them continuously adapt how they manage their businesses and operations. Our diverse customer base includes medium-sized and large, global companies within numerous industry categories, including technology, financial services, business and professional services, healthcare and life sciences, manufacturing, retail, and hospitality, as well as educational institutions, government agencies, and nonprofit organizations.
We have achieved significant growth in a relatively short period of time, with a substantial amount of our growth coming from new customers. Our current financial focus is on growing our revenues and expanding our customer base. While we have incurred net losses on a GAAP basis in each period since our inception in 2005, we strive to invest in a disciplined manner across all of our functional areas to sustain continued near-term revenue growth and support our long-term initiatives. We expect our product development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues will decrease over the longer term as we grow our revenues, and we anticipate that we will gain economies of scale by increasing our customer base without direct incremental development costs.
We plan to reinvest a significant portion of our incremental revenues in future periods to grow our business. We have invested and expect to continue to invest heavily in our product development efforts to deliver additional compelling applications and to address customers’ evolving needs. In addition, we plan to continue to expand our ability to sell our applications globally, particularly in Europe and Asia, by investing in product development and customer support to address the business needs of local markets, increasing our sales and marketing organizations, acquiring and leasing additional office space, and expanding our ecosystem of service partners to support local deployments. We expect to make further significant investments in our data center capacity and equipment as we plan for future growth. We are also investing in personnel to support our growing customer base.
We regularly evaluate acquisition and investment opportunities in complementary businesses, employee teams, services, technologies, and intellectual property rights in an effort to expand our product and service offerings. For example, we acquired Adaptive Insights in fiscal 2019 and Scout in fiscal 2020, and we recently announced our intent to acquire Peakon in fiscal 2022. We expect to continue making such acquisitions and investments in the future. While we remain focused on improving operating margins, these acquisitions and investments will increase our costs on an absolute basis in the near term. Many of these investments will occur in advance of experiencing any direct benefit from them and could make it difficult to determine if we are allocating our resources efficiently.
Since inception, we have also invested heavily in our professional services organization to help ensure that customers successfully deploy and adopt our applications. Additionally, we continue to expand our professional service partner ecosystem to further support our customers. We believe our investment in professional services, as well as partners building consulting practices around Workday, will drive additional customer subscriptions and continued growth in revenues. Due to our ability to leverage the expanding partner ecosystem, we expect the rate of professional services revenue growth to decline over time and continue to be lower than subscription revenue growth.
Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic
In December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus disease was reported, and in March 2020, the World Health Organization characterized COVID-19 as a pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic is having widespread, rapidly evolving, and unpredictable impacts on global societies, economies, financial markets, and business practices. In response to COVID-19, we have temporarily closed the majority of our offices; required most of our employees to work remotely; implemented travel restrictions; and postponed certain of our customer, industry, implementation partner, analyst, investor, and employee events and converted others to virtual-only experiences. Despite the economic challenges brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic, we are confident in the long-term overall health of our business, the strength of our product offerings, and our ability to continue to execute on our strategy.
The COVID-19 pandemic created uncertainty in most industries and impacted our ability to generate new business during fiscal 2021. Despite this, we achieved solid new subscription bookings as demand for our products remained strong. Our operating margins for fiscal 2021 have been favorably impacted by our revenue growth outpacing headcount growth as well as the moderation of operating expenses in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. We do not anticipate the extent of the favorable margin impact experienced during fiscal 2021 to continue long-term as we remain committed to investing in our business to drive top line growth and to support our customer base.
Our near-term revenues are relatively predictable as a result of our subscription-based business model. However, if the economic uncertainty persists, we may continue to experience a negative impact on new business, customer renewals, sales and marketing efforts, revenue growth rates, customer deployments, customer solvency, product development, or other financial metrics, any of which could harm our business, operating results, and financial condition.
For further discussion of the potential impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, operating results, and financial condition, see “Risk Factors” included in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Components of Results of Operations
Revenues
We derive our revenues from subscription services and professional services. Subscription services revenue primarily consists of fees that give our customers access to our cloud applications, which include related customer support. Professional services revenue includes fees for deployment services, optimization services, and training.
Subscription services revenue accounted for 88% of our total revenues during fiscal 2021, and represented 96% of our total unearned revenue as of January 31, 2021. Subscription services revenue is driven primarily by the number of customers, the number of workers at each customer, the specific applications subscribed to by each customer, and the price of our applications.
The mix of the applications to which a customer subscribes can affect our financial performance due to price differentials in our applications. Pricing for our applications varies based on many factors, including the complexity and maturity of the application and its acceptance in the marketplace. New products or services offerings by competitors in the future could also impact the mix and pricing of our offerings.
Subscription services revenue is recognized over time as services are delivered and consumed concurrently over the contractual term, beginning on the date our service is made available to the customer. Our subscription contracts typically have a term of three years or longer and are generally noncancelable. We generally invoice our customers annually in advance. Amounts that have been invoiced are initially recorded as unearned revenue.
Our consulting engagements are generally billed on a time and materials basis or a fixed price basis. For contracts billed on a time and materials basis, revenue is recognized over time as the professional services are performed. For contracts billed on a fixed price basis, revenue is recognized over time based on the proportion of the professional services performed. In some cases, we supplement our consulting teams by subcontracting resources from our service partners and deploying them on customer engagements. As our professional services organization and the Workday-related consulting practices of our partner firms continue to develop, we expect these partners to increasingly contract directly with our subscription customers. As a result of this trend, and the increase of our subscription services revenue, we expect our professional services revenue as a percentage of total revenues to decline over time.
Costs and Expenses
Costs of subscription services revenue. Costs of subscription services revenue consist primarily of employee-related expenses associated with hosting our applications and providing customer support, data center expenses, and depreciation of computer equipment and software.
Costs of professional services revenue. Costs of professional services revenue consist primarily of employee-related expenses associated with these services, subcontractor expenses, and travel expenses.
Product development. Product development expenses consist primarily of employee-related expenses. We continue to focus our product development efforts on adding new features and applications, increasing functionality, and enhancing the ease of use of our cloud applications.
Sales and marketing. Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of employee-related expenses, sales commissions, marketing programs, and travel expenses. Marketing programs consist of advertising, events, corporate communications, brand awareness, and product marketing activities. Sales commissions are considered incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer and are deferred and amortized. Sales commissions for initial contracts are deferred and then amortized on a straight-line basis over a period of benefit that we have determined to be five years. Sales commissions for renewal contracts are deferred and then amortized on a straight-line basis over the related contractual renewal period.
General and administrative. General and administrative expenses consist of employee-related expenses for finance and accounting, legal, human resources, information systems personnel, professional fees, and other corporate expenses.
Results of Operations
Revenues
Our total revenues for fiscal 2021, 2020, and 2019 were as follows (in thousands):
Year Ended January 31,
2021 2020 2019
Subscription services $ 3,788,452 $ 3,096,389 $ 2,385,769
Professional services 529,544 530,817 436,411
Total revenues $ 4,317,996 $ 3,627,206 $ 2,822,180
Total revenues were $4.3 billion for fiscal 2021, compared to $3.6 billion for fiscal 2020, an increase of $691 million, or 19%. Subscription services revenue was $3.8 billion for fiscal 2021, compared to $3.1 billion for fiscal 2020, an increase of $692 million, or 22%. The increase in subscription services revenue was due primarily to an increased number of customer contracts as compared to the prior year. Professional services revenue was $530 million for fiscal 2021, compared to $531 million for fiscal 2020, a decrease of $1 million, or 0.2%. The decrease in professional services revenue was primarily due to decreases in training revenue and reimbursable travel expenses as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, offset by increased professional services revenue due to Workday performing deployment and integration services for a greater number of customers.
Operating Expenses
GAAP operating expenses were $4.6 billion for fiscal 2021, compared to $4.1 billion for fiscal 2020, an increase of $437 million, or 11%. The increase in GAAP operating expenses included increases of $329 million in employee-related expenses driven by higher average headcount, $79 million related to a one-time cash bonus paid to non-executive employees in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 to help accommodate unforeseen costs brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic (“COVID-19 one-time employee bonus”), $46 million in facilities and IT related expenses, $31 million in third-party expenses for hardware maintenance and data center capacity, and $21 million in charitable donations, partially offset by a decrease of $92 million from reduced travel.
We use the non-GAAP financial measure of non-GAAP operating expenses to understand and compare operating results across accounting periods, for internal budgeting and forecasting purposes, for short- and long-term operating plans, and to evaluate our financial performance. See “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below for further information. We believe that non-GAAP operating expenses reflect our ongoing business in a manner that allows for meaningful period-to-period comparisons and analysis of trends in our business. We also believe that non-GAAP operating expenses provide useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results and prospects in the same manner as management and in comparing financial results across accounting periods and to those of peer companies.
Non-GAAP operating expenses are calculated by excluding share-based compensation expenses and certain other expenses, which consist of employer payroll tax-related items on employee stock transactions and amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets.
Non-GAAP operating expenses were $3.5 billion for fiscal 2021, compared to $3.1 billion for fiscal 2020, an increase of $308 million, or 10%. The increase in non-GAAP operating expenses included increases of $187 million in employee-related expenses driven by higher average headcount, $79 million related to the COVID-19 one-time employee bonus, $46 million in facilities and IT related expenses, $31 million in third-party expenses for hardware maintenance and data center capacity, and $21 million in charitable donations, partially offset by a decrease of $92 million from reduced travel.

Costs of Subscription Services
GAAP operating expenses in costs of subscription services were $612 million for fiscal 2021, compared to $489 million for fiscal 2020, an increase of $123 million, or 25%. The increase in costs of subscription services included increases of $54 million in employee-related expenses driven by higher average headcount, $26 million in depreciation expense related to equipment in our data centers, $20 million in third-party expenses for hardware maintenance and data center capacity, and $18 million in facilities and IT related expenses.
Non-GAAP operating expenses in costs of subscription services were $514 million for fiscal 2021, compared to $398 million for fiscal 2020, an increase of $116 million, or 29%. The increase in costs of subscription services included increases of $41 million in employee-related expenses driven by higher average headcount, $26 million in depreciation expense related to equipment in our data centers, $20 million in third-party expenses for hardware maintenance and data center capacity, and $18 million in facilities and IT related expenses.
We expect GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses in costs of subscription services will continue to increase in absolute dollars as we improve and expand our technical operations infrastructure, including our data centers and computing infrastructure operated by third parties.
Costs of Professional Services
GAAP operating expenses in costs of professional services were $586 million for fiscal 2021, compared to $577 million for fiscal 2020, an increase of $9 million, or 2%. The increase in costs of professional services included increases of $28 million in employee-related expenses driven by higher average headcount and $12 million related to the COVID-19 one-time employee bonus, offset by decreases of $16 million from reduced travel and $14 million in reduced subcontractor expenses.
Non-GAAP operating expenses in costs of professional services were $478 million for fiscal 2021, compared to $490 million for fiscal 2020, a decrease of $12 million, or 2%. The decrease in costs of professional services included decreases of $16 million from reduced travel and $14 million in reduced subcontractor expenses, offset by an increase of $12 million related to the COVID-19 one-time employee bonus.
We expect GAAP and non-GAAP costs of professional services as a percentage of total revenues to continue to decline as we continue to rely on our service partners to deploy our applications and as the number of our customers continues to grow.
Product Development
GAAP operating expenses in product development were $1.7 billion for fiscal 2021, compared to $1.5 billion for fiscal 2020, an increase of $171 million, or 11%. The increase in product development expenses included increases of $134 million in employee-related expenses driven by higher average headcount and $31 million related to the COVID-19 one-time employee bonus, partially offset by a decrease of $15 million from reduced travel.
Non-GAAP operating expenses in product development were $1.2 billion for fiscal 2021, compared to $1.1 billion for fiscal 2020, an increase of $103 million, or 10%. The increase in product development expenses included increases of $64 million in employee-related expenses driven by higher average headcount and $31 million related to the COVID-19 one-time employee bonus, partially offset by a decrease of $15 million from reduced travel.
We expect GAAP and non-GAAP product development expenses will continue to increase in absolute dollars as we improve and extend our applications and develop new technologies.
Sales and Marketing
GAAP operating expenses in sales and marketing were $1.2 billion for fiscal 2021, compared to $1.1 billion for fiscal 2020, an increase of $87 million, or 8%. The increase in sales and marketing expenses included increases of $88 million in employee-related expenses driven by higher average headcount, $25 million related to the COVID-19 one-time employee bonus, and $14 million related to marketing programs, partially offset by a decrease of $54 million from reduced travel.
Non-GAAP operating expenses in sales and marketing were $995 million for fiscal 2021, compared to $929 million for fiscal 2020, an increase of $66 million, or 7%. The increase in sales and marketing expenses included increases of $62 million in employee-related expenses driven by higher average headcount, $25 million related to the COVID-19 one-time employee bonus, and $14 million related to marketing programs, partially offset by a decrease of $54 million from reduced travel.
We expect GAAP and non-GAAP sales and marketing expenses to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to invest in our domestic and international selling and marketing activities to expand brand awareness and attract new customers.
General and Administrative
GAAP operating expenses in general and administrative were $414 million for fiscal 2021, compared to $368 million for fiscal 2020, an increase of $46 million, or 13%. The increase in general and administrative expenses included increases of $24 million in employee-related expenses driven by higher average headcount, $21 million in charitable donations, and $6 million related to the COVID-19 one-time employee bonus, partially offset by a decrease of $6 million from reduced travel.
Non-GAAP operating expenses in general and administrative were $276 million for fiscal 2021, compared to $241 million for fiscal 2020, an increase of $36 million, or 15%. The increase in general and administrative expenses included increases of $21 million in charitable donations, $13 million in employee-related expenses driven by higher average headcount, and $6 million related to the COVID-19 one-time employee bonus, partially offset by a decrease of $6 million from reduced travel.
We expect GAAP and non-GAAP general and administrative expenses will continue to increase in absolute dollars as we further invest in our infrastructure and support our global expansion.
Operating Margins
GAAP operating margins improved from (13.8)% for fiscal 2020 to (5.8)% for fiscal 2021. Our GAAP operating margins for fiscal 2021 have been favorably impacted by our revenue growth outpacing headcount growth as well as moderation of operating expenses in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, including reduced travel.
We use the non-GAAP financial measure of non-GAAP operating margins to understand and compare operating results across accounting periods, for internal budgeting and forecasting purposes, for short- and long-term operating plans, and to evaluate our financial performance. We believe that non-GAAP operating margins reflect our ongoing business in a manner that allows for meaningful period-to-period comparisons and analysis of trends in our business. We also believe that non-GAAP operating margins provide useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results and prospects in the same manner as management and in comparing financial results across accounting periods and to those of peer companies.
Non-GAAP operating margins are calculated using GAAP revenues and non-GAAP operating expenses. See “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below for further information.
Non-GAAP operating margins improved from 13.4% for fiscal 2020 to 20.1% for fiscal 2021. Our non-GAAP operating margins for fiscal 2021 have been favorably impacted by our revenue growth outpacing headcount growth as well as moderation of operating expenses in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, including reduced travel.

Other Income (Expense), Net
We had other expense, net of $27 million during fiscal 2021, as compared to other income, net of $20 million and $40 million during fiscal 2020 and 2019, respectively.
The decrease of $46 million in other income, net for fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 was primarily due to a decrease of $22 million in interest income on marketable securities from lower prevailing interest rates, a $20 million non-cash gain on our existing Scout investment recorded in prior year as part of the Scout acquisition, and an increase of $10 million in interest expense related to debt. The decrease was offset by an unrealized gain of $14 million on marketable equity investments in the current fiscal year.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Regulation S-K Item 10(e), “Use of non-GAAP financial measures in Commission filings,” defines and prescribes the conditions for use of non-GAAP financial information. Our measures of non-GAAP operating expenses and non-GAAP operating margins meet the definition of a non-GAAP financial measure.
Non-GAAP Operating Expenses and Non-GAAP Operating Margins
Our non-GAAP operating expenses and non-GAAP operating margins exclude the components listed below. For the reasons set forth below, management believes that excluding the component provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results and prospects in the same manner as management, in comparing financial results across accounting periods and to those of peer companies, and to better understand the long-term performance of our core business.
•Share-Based Compensation Expenses. Although share-based compensation is an important aspect of the compensation of our employees and executives, management believes it is useful to exclude share-based compensation expenses to better understand the long-term performance of our core business and to facilitate comparison of our results to those of peer companies. Share-based compensation expenses are determined using a number of factors, including our stock price, volatility, and forfeiture rates that are beyond our control and generally unrelated to operational decisions and performance in any particular period. Further, share-based compensation expenses are not reflective of the value ultimately received by the grant recipients.
•Other Operating Expenses. Other operating expenses includes employer payroll tax-related items on employee stock transactions and amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets. The amount of employer payroll tax-related items on employee stock transactions is dependent on our stock price and other factors that are beyond our control and do not correlate to the operation of the business. For business combinations, we generally allocate a portion of the purchase price to intangible assets. The amount of the allocation is based on estimates and assumptions made by management and is subject to amortization. The amount of purchase price allocated to intangible assets and the term of its related amortization can vary significantly and are unique to each acquisition and thus we do not believe it is reflective of our ongoing operations.
Limitations on the Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
A limitation of our non-GAAP financial measures of non-GAAP operating expenses and non-GAAP operating margins is that they do not have uniform definitions. Our definitions will likely differ from the definitions used by other companies, including peer companies, and therefore comparability may be limited. Further, the non-GAAP financial measure of non-GAAP operating expenses has certain limitations because it does not reflect all items of expense that affect our operations and are reflected in the GAAP financial measure of total operating expenses. In the case of share-based compensation, if we did not pay out a portion of compensation in the form of share-based compensation and related employer payroll tax-related items, the cash salary expense included in costs of revenues and operating expenses would be higher, which would affect our cash position.
We compensate for these limitations by reconciling the non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or in isolation from, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. We encourage investors and others to review our financial information in its entirety, not to rely on any single financial measure, and to view our non-GAAP financial measures in conjunction with the most comparable GAAP financial measures.
See “Results of Operations-Operating Expenses” and “Results of Operations-Operating Margins” for reconciliations from the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, GAAP operating expenses and GAAP operating margins, to the non-GAAP financial measures, non-GAAP operating expenses and non-GAAP operating margins, for fiscal 2021, 2020, and 2019.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
As of January 31, 2021, our principal sources of liquidity were cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities totaling $3.5 billion, which were primarily held for working capital purposes. Our cash equivalents and marketable securities are composed primarily of, in order from largest to smallest, U.S. treasury securities, commercial paper, money market funds, U.S. agency obligations, and corporate bonds. We have financed our operations primarily through customer payments, issuance of debt, and sales of equity securities.
We believe our existing cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, cash provided by operating activities, unbilled amounts related to the remaining term of contracted noncancelable subscription agreements, which are not reflected on the balance sheet, and, if necessary, our borrowing capacity under our Revolving Credit Facility that provides for $750 million of unsecured financing, will be sufficient to meet our working capital, capital expenditure, and debt repayment needs over the next 12 months.
Our long-term future capital requirements depend on many factors, including the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, customer growth rates, subscription renewal activity, timing and extent of development efforts, expansion of sales and marketing activities, introduction of new and enhanced services offerings, timing of construction or acquisition of additional facilities, investments, and acquisition activities. We may enter into arrangements to acquire or invest in complementary businesses, services, technologies, or intellectual property rights in the future. We also may choose to seek additional debt or equity financing.
Our cash flows for fiscal 2021, 2020, and 2019, were as follows (in thousands):
Year Ended January 31,
2021 2020 2019
Net cash provided by (used in):
Operating activities $ 1,268,441 $ 864,598 $ 606,658
Investing activities (1,241,624) (896,922) (842,784)
Financing activities 625,049 125,124 (256,711)
Effect of exchange rate changes 1,334 (282) (614)
Net increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash $ 653,200 $ 92,518 $ (493,451)
Operating Activities
Cash provided by operating activities was $1.3 billion, $865 million, and $607 million for fiscal 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. The improvement in cash flows provided by operating activities during fiscal 2021, compared to the prior fiscal year, was primarily due to increases in sales and related cash collections as well as moderation of operating expenses related to our response to the COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by higher cash operating expenses driven by higher average headcount.
We expect our business to continue to generate sufficient operating cash flows; however, if the COVID-19 pandemic worsens or is prolonged, our customers may continue to request payment timing concessions, which could materially impact the timing and predictability of our operating cash flows in any given period.
Investing Activities
Cash used in investing activities for fiscal 2021 was $1.2 billion, which was primarily comprised of a net cash outflow related to purchases and maturities of marketable securities of $930 million, capital expenditures for data center and office space projects of $253 million, and purchases of non-marketable investments of $67 million.
Cash used in investing activities for fiscal 2020 was $897 million, which was primarily comprised of a net cash outflow related to acquisition activity of $474 million, capital expenditures for data center and office space projects of $244 million, capital expenditures related to owned real estate projects of $99 million, purchases of non-marketable investments of $25 million, and the timing of purchases and maturities of marketable securities. These payments were partially offset by proceeds of $57 million from sales of marketable securities.
We expect capital expenditures for owned real estate projects to be approximately $170 million for fiscal 2022. This capital outlay is related to the purchase of the leased properties discussed in Note 12, Leases, and Note 22, Subsequent Events, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We expect capital expenditures, excluding owned real estate projects, to be approximately $270 million for fiscal 2022. These capital outlays will largely be used to expand the infrastructure of our data centers and to build out additional office space to support our growth.
Financing Activities
For fiscal 2021, cash provided by financing activities was $625 million, which was primarily comprised of net proceeds of $748 million from borrowing on the Term Loan and $149 million from the issuance of common stock from employee equity plans, partially offset by the principal payment of $250 million in connection with the conversion of the 2020 Notes.
For fiscal 2020, cash provided by financing activities was $125 million, which was primarily comprised of proceeds from the issuance of common stock from employee equity plans.
Our 2022 Notes became convertible at the option of the holders during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, and they continue to be convertible in the first quarter of fiscal 2022 since the trigger for early conversion was met. Through the date of this filing, the amount of the principal balance of the 2022 Notes that has been converted or for which conversion has been requested was not material. We may receive additional conversion requests that require settlement during fiscal 2022. For further information, see Note 11, Debt, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Contractual Obligations
Our contractual obligations primarily consist of borrowings under our Credit Agreement, our convertible senior notes, leases for office space and co-location facilities for data center capacity, and agreements for third-party hosted infrastructure platforms for business operations. As of January 31, 2021, our principal contractual cash obligations consisted of the following (in thousands):
Payments Due by Period
Total Less than 1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years More than 5 Years
Term Loan (1)
$ 768,608 $ 48,365 $ 167,631 $ 552,612 $ -

Total $ 3,152,655 $ 387,810 $ 1,667,373 $ 1,001,794 $ 95,678
(1)Consists of principal and interest payments on the Term Loan. The interest obligation on the Term Loan included in the table above assumes interest rates consistent with those in effect for our Term Loan as of January 31, 2021. For further information, see Note 11, Debt, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
(2)Consists of principal and interest payments on the 2022 Notes. For further information, see Note 11, Debt, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
(3)We have entered into operating lease agreements for our office space, data centers, and other property and equipment with various expiration dates. These lease agreements often provide us with an option to renew. The amounts in the table above represent total lease payments based on contractual terms, excluding total imputed interest of $39 million.
(4)The purchase obligations in the table above are associated with agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum services to be used, fixed, minimum or variable price provisions, and the approximate timing of the transaction. Obligations under contracts that we can cancel without a significant penalty are not included in the table above. Additionally, purchase orders are not included in the table above since they represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
Through January 31, 2021, we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated organizations or financial partnerships, such as structured finance or special purpose entities, that would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and expenses, and related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
We believe that of our significant accounting policies, which are described in Note 2, Accounting Standards and Significant Accounting Policies, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the following accounting policies involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity. Accordingly, these are the policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition and operating results.
Revenue Recognition
We derive our revenues from subscription services and professional services. Revenues are recognized when control of these services is transferred to our customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to receive in exchange for services rendered.
We determine revenue recognition through the following steps:
•Identification of the contract, or contracts, with a customer;
•Identification of the performance obligations in the contract;
•Determination of the transaction price;
•Allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and
•Recognition of revenue when, or as, we satisfy a performance obligation.
Subscription Services Revenue
Subscription services revenue primarily consists of fees that provide customers access to one or more of our cloud applications for financial management, spend management, human capital management, planning, and analytics, with routine customer support. Revenue is generally recognized on a ratable basis over the contract term beginning on the date that our service is made available to the customer. Our subscription contracts are generally three years or longer in length, billed annually in advance, and are generally noncancelable.
Professional Services Revenue
Professional services revenue primarily consists of consulting fees for deployment and optimization services, as well as training. Our consulting contracts are billed on a time and materials basis or a fixed price basis. For contracts billed on a time and materials basis, revenue is recognized over time as the professional services are performed. For contracts billed on a fixed price basis, revenue is recognized over time based on the proportion of the professional services performed.
Contracts with Multiple Performance Obligations
Some of our contracts with customers contain multiple performance obligations. For these contracts, we account for individual performance obligations separately if they are distinct. The transaction price is allocated to the separate performance obligations on a relative standalone selling price basis. We determine the standalone selling prices based on our overall pricing objectives, taking into consideration market conditions and other factors, including the value of our contracts, the cloud applications sold, customer demographics, geographic locations, and the number and types of users within our contracts.
Deferred Commissions
Sales commissions earned by our sales force are considered incremental and recoverable costs of obtaining a contract with a customer. Sales commissions for initial contracts are deferred and then amortized on a straight-line basis over a period of benefit that we have determined to be five years. We determined the period of benefit by taking into consideration our customer contracts, our technology, and other factors. Sales commissions for renewal contracts are deferred and then amortized on a straight-line basis over the related contractual renewal period. Amortization expense is included in Sales and marketing expenses on the consolidated statements of operations.
Convertible Senior Notes
In June 2013, we issued 0.75% convertible senior notes due July 15, 2018 (“2018 Notes”), with a principal amount of $350 million, which were subsequently converted by note holders during the second quarter of fiscal 2019. Concurrently, in June 2013, we issued 1.50% convertible senior notes due July 15, 2020, with a principal amount of $250 million, which were subsequently converted by note holders during the second quarter of fiscal 2021. In September 2017, we issued 0.25% convertible senior notes due October 1, 2022, with a principal amount of $1.15 billion (together with the 2018 Notes and 2020 Notes, referred to as the “Notes”). In accounting for the issuance of the Notes, we separated each of the Notes into liability and equity components. The carrying amounts of the liability components were calculated by measuring the fair value of similar liabilities that do not have associated convertible features. The carrying amount of the equity components representing the conversion option were determined by deducting the fair value of the liability components from the par value of the respective Notes. These differences represent debt discounts that are amortized to interest expense over the respective terms of the Notes using the effective interest rate method. The equity components are not remeasured as long as they continue to meet the conditions for equity classification. In accounting for the issuance costs related to the Notes, we allocated the total amount of issuance costs incurred to the liability and equity components based on their relative values. Issuance costs attributable to the liability components are being amortized on a straight-line basis, which approximates the effective interest rate method, to interest expense over the respective terms of the Notes. The issuance costs attributable to the equity components were netted against the respective equity components in Additional paid-in capital.
Business Combinations, Goodwill, and Acquisition-Related Intangible Assets
Accounting for business combinations requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions. We allocate the purchase consideration to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values, with the excess recorded to goodwill. Critical estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include, but are not limited to, future expected cash flows, expected asset useful lives, royalty rates, and discount rates. The amounts and useful lives assigned to acquisition-related intangible assets impact the amount and timing of future amortization expense.
We use estimates, assumptions, and judgments when assessing the recoverability of goodwill and acquisition-related intangible assets. We test for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if a significant event or circumstance indicates impairment. We also evaluate the estimated remaining useful lives of acquisition-related intangible assets for changes in circumstances that warrant a revision to the remaining periods of amortization.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in negative impacts on global economies and financial markets, which may increase our foreign currency exchange risk and interest rate risk. For further discussion of the potential impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, operating results, and financial condition, see “Risk Factors” included in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Foreign Currency Exchange Risk
We transact business globally in multiple currencies. As a result, our operating results and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. As of January 31, 2021, our most significant currency exposures were the euro, Canadian dollar, British pound, and Australian dollar.
Due to our exposure to market risks that may result from changes in foreign currency exchange rates, we enter into foreign currency derivative hedging transactions to mitigate these risks.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Workday, Inc.
Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Workday, Inc. (the Company) as of January 31, 2021 and 2020, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive loss, stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended January 31, 2021, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at January 31, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended January 31, 2021, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated March 2, 2021 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matter
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the account or disclosure to which it relates.
Revenue Recognition
Description of the Matter As described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company recognizes revenue primarily from subscription services and professional services contracts. Some of the Company’s contracts contain multiple performance obligations. For these contracts, the Company assesses the performance obligations and accounts for those obligations separately if they are distinct. In such cases, the transaction price is allocated to the distinct performance obligations on a relative standalone selling price basis.
Auditing the Company's determination of distinct performance obligations and the allocation of the transaction price to these performance obligations was challenging. For example, there were nonstandard terms and conditions that required judgment to determine the distinct performance obligations and relative standalone selling prices were accounted for appropriately.
How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company's process to identify distinct performance obligations and allocate the transaction price to those performance obligations, including the underlying assumptions related to the relative standalone selling price.
Among other audit procedures, we selected a sample of contracts and evaluated whether management appropriately identified and considered the terms and conditions and the appropriate revenue recognition. As part of our procedures, we evaluated the assessment of distinct performance obligations and the accuracy and completeness of the underlying data used in management's determination of the relative standalone selling prices.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Workday, Inc.
Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
We have audited Workday, Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Workday, Inc. (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2021, based on the COSO criteria.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of January 31, 2021 and 2020, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive loss, stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended January 31, 2021, and the related notes and our report dated March 2, 2021 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
Basis for Opinion
The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
Note 1. Overview and Basis of Presentation
Company and Background
Workday delivers financial management, spend management, human capital management, planning, and analytics applications designed for the world’s largest companies, educational institutions, and government agencies. We offer innovative and adaptable technology focused on the consumer internet experience and cloud delivery model. Our applications are designed for global enterprises to manage complex and dynamic operating environments. We provide our customers highly adaptable, accessible, and reliable applications to manage critical business functions that help enable them to optimize their financial and human resources. We were originally incorporated in March 2005 in Nevada, and in June 2012, we reincorporated in Delaware.
Fiscal Year
Our fiscal year ends on January 31. References to fiscal 2021, for example, refer to the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021.
Basis of Presentation
These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP and include the results of Workday, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.
Certain prior period amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto have been reclassified to conform to current period presentation.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make certain estimates, judgments, and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Significant estimates, judgments, and assumptions include, but are not limited to, the determination of the fair value and useful lives of assets acquired and liabilities assumed through business combinations, the period of benefit for deferred commissions, the fair value of certain equity awards, and the valuation of non-marketable equity investments. Actual results could differ from those estimates and such differences could be material to our consolidated financial statements.
Segment Information
We operate in one operating segment, cloud applications. Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise where separate financial information is evaluated regularly by chief operating decision makers (“CODMs”) in deciding how to allocate resources and assessing performance. For fiscal 2021, our CODMs were our co-chief executive officers, Aneel Bhusri and Chano Fernandez. Our CODMs allocate resources and assess performance based upon discrete financial information at the consolidated level.
Note 2. Accounting Standards and Significant Accounting Policies
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Revenue Recognition
We derive our revenues from subscription services and professional services. Revenues are recognized when control of these services is transferred to our customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to receive in exchange for services rendered.
We determine revenue recognition through the following steps:
•Identification of the contract, or contracts, with a customer;
•Identification of the performance obligations in the contract;
•Determination of the transaction price;
•Allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and
•Recognition of revenue when, or as, we satisfy a performance obligation.
Subscription Services Revenue
Subscription services revenue primarily consists of fees that provide customers access to one or more of our cloud applications for financial management, spend management, human capital management, planning, and analytics, with routine customer support. Revenue is generally recognized on a ratable basis over the contract term beginning on the date that our service is made available to the customer. Our subscription contracts are generally three years or longer in length, billed annually in advance, and are generally noncancelable.
Professional Services Revenue
Professional services revenue primarily consists of consulting fees for deployment and optimization services, as well as training. Our consulting contracts are billed on a time and materials basis or a fixed price basis. For contracts billed on a time and materials basis, revenue is recognized over time as the professional services are performed. For contracts billed on a fixed price basis, revenue is recognized over time based on the proportion of the professional services performed.
Contracts with Multiple Performance Obligations
Some of our contracts with customers contain multiple performance obligations. For these contracts, we account for individual performance obligations separately if they are distinct. The transaction price is allocated to the separate performance obligations on a relative standalone selling price basis. We determine the standalone selling prices based on our overall pricing objectives, taking into consideration market conditions and other factors, including the value of our contracts, the cloud applications sold, customer demographics, geographic locations, and the number and types of users within our contracts.
Fair Value Measurement
We measure our cash equivalents, marketable securities, and foreign currency derivative contracts at fair value at each reporting period using a fair value hierarchy that requires that we maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. In addition, we measure our non-marketable equity investments for which there has been an observable price change from an orderly transaction for identical or similar investments of the same issuer at fair value. A financial instrument’s classification within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Three levels of inputs may be used to measure fair value:
Level 1 - Observable inputs that reflect quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.
Level 2 - Other inputs that are directly or indirectly observable in the marketplace.
Level 3 - Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase. Our cash equivalents primarily consist of investments in U.S. treasury securities, U.S. agency obligations, corporate bonds, commercial paper, and money market funds.
Debt Securities
Debt securities primarily consist of investments in U.S. treasury securities, U.S. agency obligations, corporate bonds, and commercial paper. We classify our debt securities as available-for-sale at the time of purchase and reevaluate such classification as of each balance sheet date. We consider all debt securities as available for use in current operations, including those with maturity dates beyond one year, and therefore classify these securities as current assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Debt securities included in Marketable securities on the consolidated balance sheets consist of securities with original maturities greater than three months at the time of purchase.
When the fair value of a debt security is below its amortized cost, the amortized cost should be written down to its fair value if (i) it is more likely than not that management will be required to sell the impaired security before recovery of its amortized basis or (ii) management has the intention to sell the security. If neither of these conditions are met, we must determine whether the impairment is due to credit losses. To determine the amount of credit losses, we compare the present value of the expected cash flows of the security, derived by taking into account the issuer’s credit ratings and remaining payment terms, with its amortized cost basis. The amount of impairment recognized is limited to the excess of the amortized cost over the fair value of the security. An allowance for credit losses for the excess of amortized cost over the expected cash flows is recorded in Other income (expense), net on our consolidated statements of operations. Non-credit related impairment losses are recorded in Other comprehensive income (loss) (“OCI”).
If quoted prices for identical instruments are available in an active market, debt securities are classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. If quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets are not available, fair values are estimated using quoted prices of similar instruments and are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. To date, all of our debt securities can be valued using one of these two methodologies.
Equity Investments
We determine at the inception of each arrangement whether an investment or other interest is considered a variable interest entity (“VIE”). If the investment or other interest is determined to be a VIE, we must evaluate whether we are considered the primary beneficiary. The primary beneficiary of a VIE is the party that meets both of the following criteria: (1) has the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance; and (2) has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the VIE. For investments in VIEs in which we are considered the primary beneficiary, the assets, liabilities, and results of operations of the VIE are consolidated in our consolidated financial statements. As of January 31, 2021, there were no VIEs for which we were the primary beneficiary.
Equity Investments Accounted for Under the Equity Method
Investments in VIEs for which we are not the primary beneficiary or do not own a controlling interest but can exercise significant influence over the investee are accounted for under the equity method of accounting. These investments are measured at cost, less any impairment, plus or minus our share of earnings and losses and are included in Other assets on the consolidated balance sheets. Our share of earnings and losses are recorded in Other income (expense), net on the consolidated statements of operations.
Non-Marketable Equity Investments Measured Using the Measurement Alternative
Non-marketable equity investments measured using the measurement alternative include investments in privately held companies without readily determinable fair values in which we do not own a controlling interest or have significant influence. These investments are included in Other assets on the consolidated balance sheets. We adjust the carrying values of non-marketable equity investments based on observable price changes from orderly transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer. Additionally, we assess our non-marketable equity investments quarterly for impairment. Adjustments and impairments are recorded in Other income (expense), net on the consolidated statements of operations.
Non-marketable equity investments are valued using significant unobservable inputs or data in an inactive market. Valuations of non-marketable equity investments are inherently complex due to the lack of readily available market data, and require our judgment due to the absence of market prices and inherent lack of liquidity. In addition, the determination of whether an orderly transaction is for an identical or similar investment requires significant management judgment, including understanding the differences in the rights and obligations of the investments and the extent to which those differences would affect the fair values of those investments.
Our impairment analysis encompasses a qualitative and quantitative analysis of key factors including the investee’s financial metrics, market acceptance of the investee’s product or technology, other competitive products or technology in the market, general market conditions, and the rate at which the investee is using its cash. We also consider the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. These factors require significant judgment. If impairment is identified, we will assess the severity and duration of the impairment.
Non-marketable equity investments that have been remeasured during the period due to an observable event or impairment are classified within Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy because we estimate the value based on valuation methods which may include a combination of the observable transaction price at the transaction date and other unobservable inputs including volatility, rights, and obligations of the investments we hold.
Marketable Equity Investments
We hold marketable equity investments over which we do not have a controlling interest or significant influence. Marketable equity investments are included in Marketable securities on the consolidated balance sheets. They are measured using quoted prices in active markets with changes recorded in Other income (expense), net on the consolidated statements of operations.
Trade and Other Receivables
Trade and other receivables are primarily comprised of trade receivables that are recorded at the invoice amount, net of an allowance for credit losses. We assess our allowance for credit losses on trade receivables by taking into consideration forecasts of future economic conditions, information about past events, such as our historical trend of write-offs, and customer-specific circumstances, such as bankruptcies and disputes. The allowance for credit losses on trade receivables is recorded in operating expenses on our consolidated statements of operations. Other receivables represent unbilled receivables related to subscription and professional services contracts.
Deferred Commissions
Sales commissions earned by our sales force are considered incremental and recoverable costs of obtaining a contract with a customer. Sales commissions for initial contracts are deferred and then amortized on a straight-line basis over a period of benefit that we have determined to be five years. We determined the period of benefit by taking into consideration our customer contracts, our technology, and other factors. Sales commissions for renewal contracts are deferred and then amortized on a straight-line basis over the related contractual renewal period. Amortization expense is included in Sales and marketing expenses on the consolidated statements of operations.
Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedging Activities
We use derivative financial instruments to manage foreign currency exchange risk. Derivative instruments are carried at fair value and recorded as either an asset or liability on the consolidated balance sheets. Gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value are accounted for depending on the use of the derivative and whether it is designated and qualifies for hedge accounting. For derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges, which we use to hedge certain customer contracts denominated in foreign currencies, the gains or losses are recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (“AOCI”) on the consolidated balance sheets and subsequently reclassified to income in the same period that the underlying revenues are earned. For derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments, which we use to hedge a portion of our net outstanding monetary assets and liabilities, the gains or losses are recorded in Other income (expense), net on the consolidated statement of operations in the period of change. We use nonderivative financial instruments designated as net investment hedges to hedge our net investment in certain foreign subsidiaries. The gains or losses, which are not material, are recorded in the currency translation adjustment component of AOCI and are reclassified to income in the period in which the hedged subsidiary is either sold or substantially liquidated.
Our foreign currency contracts are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy because the valuation inputs are based on quoted prices and market observable data of similar instruments in active markets, such as currency spot and forward rates.
Property and Equipment
Property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is recorded using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets. Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the shorter of the related lease term or ten years. Property and equipment is reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.
Business Combinations
We use our best estimates and assumptions to assign fair value to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date. Our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. During the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, we may record adjustments to the fair value of these tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill. In addition, uncertain tax positions and tax-related valuation allowances are initially established in connection with a business combination as of the acquisition date. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the fair value of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to our consolidated statements of operations.
Goodwill and Acquisition-Related Intangible Assets
Acquisition-related intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives. Goodwill amounts are not amortized. Acquisition-related intangible assets and goodwill are tested for impairment at least annually, and more frequently upon the occurrence of certain events.
Unearned Revenue
Unearned revenue primarily consists of customer billings in advance of revenues being recognized from our subscription contracts. We generally invoice our customers annually in advance for our subscription services. Our typical payment terms provide that customers pay a portion of the total arrangement fee within 30 days of the contract date. Unearned revenue that is anticipated to be recognized during the succeeding twelve-month period is recorded as current unearned revenue and the remaining portion is recorded as noncurrent.
Convertible Senior Notes
In June 2013, we issued 0.75% convertible senior notes due July 15, 2018, with a principal amount of $350 million, which were subsequently converted by note holders during the second quarter of fiscal 2019. Concurrently. in June 2013, we issued 1.50% convertible senior notes due July 15, 2020 with a principal amount of $250 million, which were subsequently converted by note holders during the second quarter of fiscal 2021. In September 2017, we issued 0.25% convertible senior notes due October 1, 2022, with a principal amount of $1.15 billion. In accounting for the issuance of the Notes, we separated each of the Notes into liability and equity components. The carrying amounts of the liability components were calculated by measuring the fair value of similar liabilities that do not have associated convertible features. The carrying amount of the equity components representing the conversion option were determined by deducting the fair value of the liability components from the par value of the respective Notes. These differences represent debt discounts that are amortized to interest expense over the respective terms of the Notes using the effective interest rate method. The equity components are not remeasured as long as they continue to meet the conditions for equity classification. In accounting for the issuance costs related to the Notes, we allocated the total amount of issuance costs incurred to the liability and equity components based on their relative values. Issuance costs attributable to the liability components are being amortized on a straight-line basis, which approximates the effective interest rate method, to interest expense over the respective terms of the Notes. The issuance costs attributable to the equity components were netted against the respective equity components in Additional paid-in capital.
Leases
We have entered into operating lease agreements for our office space, data centers, and other property and equipment. Operating lease right-of-use assets and operating lease liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value of the lease payments over the lease term. Right-of-use assets also include adjustments related to prepaid or deferred lease payments and lease incentives. As most of our leases do not provide an implicit interest rate, we use our incremental borrowing rate to determine the present value of lease payments.
We recognize variable lease costs in our consolidated statement of operations in the period incurred. Variable lease costs include common area maintenance, utilities, real estate taxes, insurance, and other operating costs that are passed on from the lessor.
Options to extend or terminate a lease are included in the lease term when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise such options. The remaining lease term of our leases generally ranges from less than one year to nine years.
Advertising Expenses
Advertising is expensed as incurred. Advertising expense was $85 million, $61 million, and $51 million for fiscal 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively.
Share-Based Compensation
We measure and recognize compensation expense for share-based awards issued to employees and non-employees, including RSUs, performance-based restricted stock units (“PRSUs”), stock options, and purchases under the 2012 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”), on our consolidated statements of operations.
For RSUs and PRSUs, fair value is based on the closing price of our common stock on the grant date. Compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures, is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. The requisite service period of the awards is generally the same as the vesting period.
For stock options assumed, fair value is estimated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. Compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures, is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. We determine the assumptions for the option-pricing model as follows:
•Risk-Free Interest Rate. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the date closest to the grant date for zero-coupon U.S. Treasury notes with maturities approximately equal to the expected term of the stock option grants.
•Expected Term. The expected term represents the period that our share-based award is expected to be outstanding. The expected term for stock options was determined based on the vesting terms, exercise terms, and contractual lives.
•Volatility. The volatility is based on a blend of historical volatility and implied volatility of our common stock. Implied volatility is based on market traded options of our common stock.
•Dividend Yield. The dividend yield is assumed to be zero as we have not paid and do not expect to pay dividends.
For shares issued under the ESPP, fair value is estimated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. Compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the offering period. We determine the assumptions for the option-pricing model as follows:
•Risk-Free Interest Rate. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the date closest to the grant date for zero-coupon U.S. Treasury notes with maturities approximately equal to the expected term of the ESPP purchase rights.
•Expected Term. The expected term represents the period that our ESPP is expected to be outstanding. The expected term for the ESPP approximates the offering period.
•Volatility. The volatility is based on a blend of historical volatility and implied volatility of our common stock. Implied volatility is based on market traded options of our common stock.
•Dividend Yield. The dividend yield is assumed to be zero as we have not paid and do not expect to pay dividends.
Income Taxes
We record a provision for income taxes for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations using the asset and liability method. Under this method, we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities, as well as for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the tax rates that are expected to apply to taxable income for the years in which those tax assets and liabilities are expected to be realized or settled. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the net amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized.
We recognize tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if we believe that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. Although we believe that we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions, we can provide no assurance that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be materially different. We make adjustments to these reserves when facts and circumstances change, such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will affect the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made and could have a material impact on our financial condition and operating results. The provision for income taxes includes the effects of any accruals that we believe are appropriate, as well as the related net interest and penalties.
Warranties and Indemnification
Our cloud applications are generally warranted to perform materially in accordance with our online documentation under normal use and circumstances. Additionally, our contracts generally include provisions for indemnifying customers against liabilities if use of our cloud applications infringe a third party’s intellectual property rights. We may also incur liabilities if we breach the security, privacy and/or confidentiality obligations in our contracts. To date, we have not incurred any material costs, and we have not accrued any liabilities in the accompanying consolidated financial statements, as a result of these obligations.
In our standard agreements with customers, we commit to defined levels of service availability and performance and, under certain circumstances, permit customers to receive credits in the event that we fail to meet those levels. In the event our failure to meet those levels triggers a termination right for a customer, we permit a terminating customer to receive a refund of prepaid amounts related to unused subscription services. To date, we have not experienced any significant failures to meet defined levels of availability and performance and, as a result, we have not accrued any liabilities related to these agreements on the consolidated financial statements.
Foreign Currency Exchange
The functional currency for certain of our foreign subsidiaries is the U.S. dollar, while others use local currencies. We translate the foreign functional currency financial statements to U.S. dollars for those entities that do not have the U.S. dollar as their functional currency using the exchange rates at the balance sheet date for assets and liabilities, the period average exchange rates for revenues and expenses, and the historical exchange rates for equity transactions. The effects of foreign currency translation adjustments are recorded in AOCI on the consolidated balance sheets. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are included in Other income (expense), net on the consolidated statements of operations.
Concentrations of Risk and Significant Customers
Our financial instruments that are exposed to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, debt securities, and trade and other receivables. Our deposits exceed federally insured limits.
No customer individually accounted for more than 10% of trade and other receivables, net as of January 31, 2021, or 2020. No customer individually accounted for more than 10% of total revenues during fiscal 2021, 2020, or 2019.
In order to reduce the risk of down-time of our cloud applications, we have established data centers in various geographic regions. We have internal procedures to restore services in the event of disaster at one of our current data center facilities. We serve our customers and users from data center facilities operated by third parties, located in the United States, Europe, and Canada. Even with these procedures for disaster recovery in place, our cloud applications could be significantly interrupted during the implementation of the procedures to restore services.
In addition, we rely upon third-party hosted infrastructure partners globally, including AWS and Dimension Data, to serve customers and operate certain aspects of our services, such as environments for development testing, training, sales demonstrations, and production usage. Given this, any disruption of or interference at our hosted infrastructure partners would impact our operations and our business could be adversely impacted.
Other than the United States, no country individually accounted for more than 10% of total revenues for any of the periods on the consolidated financial statements.
Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements
ASU No. 2016-13
In June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, which requires the measurement and recognition of expected credit losses for financial assets held at amortized cost, including trade receivables. It also eliminates the concept of other-than-temporary impairment and requires credit losses related to available-for-sale debt securities to be recorded through an allowance for credit losses rather than as a reduction in the amortized cost basis of the securities.
We adopted this standard effective February 1, 2020, using a modified retrospective approach, which resulted in a cumulative-effect adjustment of $0.2 million to Accumulated deficit.
ASU No. 2018-15
In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-15, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other-Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40): Customer’s Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement That Is a Service Contract, which aligns the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract with the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred to develop or obtain internal-use software. The new standard requires capitalized costs to be amortized on a straight-line basis generally over the term of the arrangement, and the financial statement presentation for these capitalized costs would be the same as that of the fees related to the hosting arrangements.
We adopted this standard effective February 1, 2020, using a prospective approach. The adoption of this new standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. Subsequent impact on our consolidated financial statements will depend on the magnitude of implementation costs to be incurred. Implementation costs capitalized subsequent to adoption will be recognized in operating expenses on our consolidated statements of operations over the noncancelable period of the hosting arrangement plus any renewal periods reasonably certain to be taken.
ASU No. 2019-12
In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes, which simplifies accounting guidance for certain tax matters, including franchise taxes and certain transactions that result in a step-up in tax basis of goodwill, and enacts changes in tax laws in interim periods. In addition, it eliminates a company’s need to evaluate certain exceptions relating to the incremental approach for intra-period tax allocation, accounting for basis differences when there are ownership changes in foreign investments, and interim period income tax accounting for year-to-date losses that exceed anticipated losses.
We adopted this standard effective February 1, 2020. We adopted the amendments in this update on a retrospective basis for the provision related to franchise taxes and prospectively for all other applicable amendments. The adoption of this new standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements
ASU No. 2020-04 and ASU No. 2021-01
In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting, which provides temporary optional expedients and exceptions to GAAP guidance on contract modifications to ease the financial reporting burdens related to the expected market transition from the London Interbank Offered Rate to alternative reference rates. In January 2021, the FASB issued ASU No. 2021-01, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848), which refines the scope of Topic 848 and clarifies some of its guidance. We may elect to apply the amendments prospectively through December 31, 2022. The impact on our consolidated financial statements from the adoption of this standard is expected to be immaterial.
ASU No. 2020-06
In August 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-06, Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging-Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40). Under ASU No. 2020-06, the embedded conversion features are no longer separated from the host contract for convertible instruments with conversion features that are not required to be accounted for as derivatives under Topic 815, or that do not result in substantial premiums accounted for as paid-in capital. Consequently, a convertible debt instrument will be accounted for as a single liability measured at its amortized cost, as long as no other features require bifurcation and recognition as derivatives. The new guidance also requires the if-converted method to be applied for all convertible instruments when calculating earnings per share. This new standard is effective for our interim and annual periods beginning February 1, 2022, and earlier adoption is permitted. We intend to early adopt this standard effective February 1, 2021, using the modified retrospective approach. Adoption of the new standard is expected to result in a decrease to Accumulated deficit of approximately $140 million, a decrease to Additional paid-in capital of approximately $220 million, and an increase to Debt, current of approximately $80 million. There will be an immaterial impact on Property and equipment related to non-cash interest previously capitalized. If all of the 2022 Notes remain outstanding through maturity, non-cash interest expense will be reduced by approximately $45 million in fiscal 2022, and approximately $30 million in fiscal 2023.

Equity Investments Accounted for Under the Equity Method
During the first quarter of fiscal 2021, we made an equity investment of $50 million in a limited partnership, which represents an ownership interest of approximately 6%. We determined that the limited partnership is a VIE because the at-risk equity holders, as a group, lack the characteristics of a controlling financial interest. We do not have majority voting rights nor the power to direct the activities of this entity, and therefore, we are not the primary beneficiary. The investment is accounted for under the equity method of accounting as it is considered to be more than minor and we have the ability to exercise significant influence over the entity. The carrying value was $48 million as of January 31, 2021. There was no impairment loss recorded on this investment during fiscal 2021.
Non-Marketable Equity Investments Measured Using the Measurement Alternative
During fiscal 2021 and 2020, there were $9 million and $6 million in upward adjustments to the carrying values of non-marketable equity investments as measured under the measurement alternative. No material adjustments were made to the carrying value of the non-marketable equity investments during fiscal 2019, and no material impairment losses were recorded during fiscal 2021, 2020, or 2019. In addition, during fiscal 2020 we recognized a $20 million non-cash gain on the sale of a non-marketable equity investment as part of the Scout acquisition. See Note 7, Business Combinations for further details on the Scout acquisition.
Marketable Equity Investments
During fiscal 2021 and 2019, we recorded unrealized gains on marketable equity investments of $14 million and $34 million, respectively. There were no unrealized gains or losses recorded during fiscal 2020. During fiscal 2020, we sold $51 million of marketable equity investments, with a corresponding gain recognized of $7 million. There were no sales of marketable equity investments during fiscal 2021 or 2019.

Fair Value Measurements of Other Financial Instruments
In April 2020, we entered into a Credit Agreement pursuant to which the lenders extended to Workday a senior unsecured Term Loan in an aggregate principal amount of $750 million and an unsecured Revolving Credit Facility in an aggregate principal amount of $750 million. As of January 31, 2021, the carrying value of the Term Loan was $729 million, and there were no outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility. The estimated fair value of the Term Loan, which we have classified as a Level 2 financial instrument, approximates its carrying value because it is a floating rate facility. For further information, see Note 11, Debt.
The following table presents the carrying amounts and estimated fair values of our outstanding Notes which are not recorded at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets (in thousands):
January 31, 2021 January 31, 2020
Net Carrying Amount Estimated Fair Value Net Carrying Amount Estimated Fair Value

0.25% Convertible senior notes due 2022
1,065,601 1,838,448 1,017,967 1,587,978
The carrying amounts of the Notes represent the liability components of the principal balances as of January 31, 2021, and 2020. The estimated fair values of the Notes, which we have classified as Level 2 financial instruments, were determined based on the quoted bid prices of the Notes in an over-the-counter market on the last trading day of fiscal 2021 and 2020. As of January 31, 2021, the if-converted value of the 2022 Notes exceeded the principal amount by $629 million. The if-converted value was determined based on the closing price of our common stock of $227.53 on the last trading day of fiscal 2021. For further information, see Note 11, Debt.
Note 5. Deferred Costs
Deferred costs, which consist of deferred sales commissions, were $395 million and $323 million as of January 31, 2021, and 2020, respectively. Amortization expense for the deferred costs was $113 million, $91 million, and $71 million for fiscal 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. There was no impairment loss in relation to the costs capitalized for the periods presented.

Note 7. Business Combinations
Fiscal 2020
Scout Acquisition
On December 9, 2019, we acquired all outstanding stock of Scout, a cloud-based platform for strategic sourcing and supplier engagement, for total purchase consideration of $513 million, attributable to cash consideration of $485 million and the fair value of a previously held equity interest of $28 million. The acquisition of Scout helps accelerate our ability to deliver a comprehensive source-to-pay solution to our customers.
The purchase consideration was allocated to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date, with the excess recorded to goodwill as shown below. The purchase consideration allocation, which includes measurement period adjustments, was as follows (in thousands):
Acquisition-related intangible assets $ 63,400
Other assets acquired 37,087
Liabilities assumed (17,270)
Total purchase consideration, inclusive of previously held equity interest 513,492
Estimated goodwill $ 430,275

Trade name $ 400 1
Developed technology 28,000 5
Customer relationships 35,000 10
Total acquisition-related intangible assets $ 63,400 8
The goodwill recognized was primarily attributable to the assembled workforce and the expected synergies from integrating Scout's technology into our product portfolio. The goodwill is not deductible for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
We have included the financial results of Scout in our consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition. Separate operating results and pro forma results of operations for Scout have not been presented as the effect of this acquisition was not material to our financial results.
Other Acquisitions
In the second quarter of fiscal 2020, acquisition activity resulted in an increase of $4 million and $9 million in acquired developed technology and goodwill, respectively.
Fiscal 2019
Adaptive Insights Acquisition
On August 1, 2018, we acquired all outstanding stock of Adaptive Insights for $1.5 billion.

Total purchase consideration 1,490,917
Goodwill $ 1,204,885
(1)The cost build-up method was used to determine the fair value of unearned revenue.
The goodwill recognized was primarily attributable to the value of the acquired workforce, the opportunity to expand our customer base, and the ability to add breadth and depth to our product portfolio by accelerating our financial planning roadmap. The goodwill is not deductible for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
The fair values and estimated useful lives of the acquired intangible assets by category were as follows (in thousands, except years):
Estimated Fair Values Estimated Useful Lives
(in years)
Trade name $ 12,000 1.5
Developed technology 105,000 5
Customer relationships 188,000 9 - 10
Backlog 11,000 2
Total acquisition-related intangible assets $ 316,000 8
The fair values of the trade name and developed technology were determined utilizing the relief-from-royalty method, and the multi-period excess earnings method was utilized to fair value customer relationships and backlog. The valuation model inputs required the application of considerable judgment by management. The acquired finite-lived intangible assets have a total weighted-average amortization period of eight years. The weighted-average amortization period of customer relationships is ten years.
We have included the financial results of Adaptive Insights in our consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition. One-time acquisition related transaction costs of $25 million were expensed as incurred during fiscal 2019, and were recorded in general and administrative expense on our consolidated statements of operations.
The pro forma financial information shown below summarizes the combined results of operations for Workday and Adaptive Insights as if the closing of the acquisition had occurred on February 1, 2017, the first day of our fiscal year 2018. The pro forma financial information includes adjustments that are directly attributable to the business combination and are factually supportable. The adjustments primarily reflect the amortization of acquired intangible assets, share-based compensation expense for replacement awards, as well as the pro forma tax impact for such adjustments. The pro forma financial information reflects $67 million of nonrecurring expenses related to acquisition costs and certain compensation expenses.

Note 10. Derivative Instruments
We conduct business on a global basis in multiple foreign currencies, subjecting Workday to foreign currency risk. To mitigate this risk, we utilize derivative hedging contracts as described below. We do not enter into any derivatives for trading or speculative purposes.
Foreign Currency Forward Contracts Designated as Cash Flow Hedges
We are exposed to foreign currency fluctuations resulting from customer contracts denominated in foreign currencies. We have a hedging program in which we enter into foreign currency forward contracts related to certain customer contracts. We designate these forward contracts as cash flow hedging instruments since the accounting criteria for such designation have been met.
Foreign currency forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value. Cash flows from such forward contracts are classified as operating activities. Gains or losses resulting from changes in the fair value of these hedges are recorded in AOCI on the consolidated balance sheets and will be subsequently reclassified to the related revenue line item on the consolidated statements of operations in the same period that the underlying revenues are earned. As of January 31, 2021, we estimate that $8 million of net losses recorded in AOCI related to our foreign currency forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges will be reclassified into income within the next 12 months.
As of January 31, 2021, and 2020, we had outstanding foreign currency forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges with total notional values of $1.3 billion and $908 million, respectively. The notional value represents the amount that will be bought or sold upon maturity of the forward contract. All contracts have maturities of less than 48 months.
Foreign Currency Forward Contracts Not Designated as Hedges
We also enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge a portion of our net outstanding monetary assets and liabilities. These forward contracts are intended to offset the foreign currency gains or losses associated with the underlying monetary assets and liabilities and are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value. These forward contracts are not designated as hedging instruments under applicable accounting guidance, and therefore all changes in the fair value of these forward contracts are recorded in Other income (expense), net on the consolidated statements of operations. Cash flows from such forward contracts are classified as operating activities.
As of January 31, 2021, and 2020, we had outstanding forward contracts not designated as hedges with total notional values of $175 million and $246 million, respectively.

(1)Prior to the adoption of ASU No. 2017-12, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815), the changes in value of these foreign currency forward contracts resulting from changes in forward points were excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and were recorded as incurred in Other income (expense), net on the consolidated statements of operations. Upon adoption of ASU No. 2017-12, we elected to prospectively include changes in the value of these contracts resulting from changes in forward points in the assessment of hedge effectiveness. These changes are recorded in AOCI on the consolidated balance sheets and will be subsequently reclassified to the related revenue line item on the consolidated statements of operations in the same period that the underlying revenues are earned.

We are subject to master netting agreements with all of the counterparties of the foreign exchange contracts, under which we are permitted to net settle transactions of the same currency with a single net amount payable by one party to the other. It is our policy to present the derivatives gross on the consolidated balance sheets. Our foreign currency forward contracts are not subject to any credit contingent features or collateral requirements. We manage our exposure to counterparty risk by entering into contracts with a diversified group of major financial institutions and by actively monitoring outstanding positions.

Credit Agreement
In April 2020, we entered into a Credit Agreement pursuant to which the lenders extended to Workday a senior unsecured Term Loan in an aggregate principal amount of $750 million and an unsecured Revolving Credit Facility in an aggregate principal amount of $750 million.
The Term Loan and Revolving Credit Facility bear interest, at our option, at either (i) a floating rate per annum equal to the base rate plus a margin that ranges from 0% to 0.625%, or (ii) a per annum rate equal to the rate at which dollar deposits are offered in the London interbank market plus a margin that ranges from 1.000% to 1.625%. The base rate is defined as the greatest of (i) Bank of America’s prime rate, (ii) the federal funds rate plus 0.50%, or (iii) a per annum rate equal to the rate at which dollar deposits are offered in the London interbank market for a period of one month (but not less than zero) plus 1.00%. Actual margins under either election will be based on our consolidated leverage ratio, which is measured by dividing (a) our consolidated funded indebtedness as of the end of the fiscal quarter by (b) our consolidated EBITDA as defined in the Credit Agreement for the most recently completed four consecutive fiscal quarters.
The Credit Agreement contains customary representations, warranties, and affirmative and negative covenants, including a financial covenant, events of default, and indemnification provisions in favor of the lenders. The financial covenant, based on a quarterly financial test, requires Workday not to exceed a maximum leverage ratio of 3.50:1.00, subject to a step-up to 4.50:1.00 at the election of Workday for a certain period following an Acquisition (as defined in the Credit Agreement). As of January 31, 2021, we were in compliance with all covenants.
Term Loan
The Term Loan was funded in two individual tranches. On April 2, 2020, $500 million of the Term Loan was funded, and the remaining $250 million was funded on July 13, 2020.
The Term Loan matures on April 2, 2025, and provides for quarterly repayment in installments of the principal amount, beginning October 2020, at a rate of 1.25% of the principal amount per quarter through January 2022, and 2.50% of the principal amount per quarter thereafter. The Term Loan may be prepaid or permanently reduced by Workday without penalty or premium.
We incurred fees of approximately $2 million in connection with entering into the agreement for the Term Loan. The fees paid to the lenders for the issuance of the debt are accounted for as a debt discount, while the remaining fees paid to third parties are accounted for as debt issuance costs. The debt discount and issuance costs are amortized on a straight-line basis, which approximates the effective interest rate method, to interest expense over the contractual term of the arrangement.
As of January 31, 2021, the Term Loan had a carrying value of $729 million, of which $38 million is classified as current and $692 million is classified as noncurrent on the consolidated balance sheet. As of January 31, 2021, the interest rate on the Term Loan was 1.38% and the effective interest rate was 1.46%.
Revolving Credit Facility
The Revolving Credit Facility may be borrowed, repaid, and reborrowed until April 2, 2025, at which time all amounts borrowed must be repaid. We may request, no more than two times during the term of the Credit Agreement, that each revolving lender extend the maturity date for the revolving loans for one year. Additionally, we may request an increase in aggregate revolving commitments of up to $250 million at any time prior to April 2, 2025. The Revolving Credit Facility may be prepaid or permanently reduced by Workday without penalty or premium.
We are required to pay each revolving lender a commitment fee on a quarterly basis based on amounts committed but unused under the Revolving Credit Facility that ranges from 0.090% to 0.225% per annum, depending on our consolidated leverage ratio. The commitment fee is expensed as incurred and included within Other income (expense), net on the consolidated statement of operations.
We incurred fees of approximately $2 million in connection with entering into the agreement for the Revolving Credit Facility. The fees are recorded in Other assets on the consolidated balance sheet and are amortized on a straight-line basis over the contractual term of the arrangement.
As of January 31, 2021, there were no outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility.
Convertible Senior Notes
In June 2013, we issued 0.75% convertible senior notes due July 15, 2018, with a principal amount of $350 million. The 2018 Notes were unsecured, unsubordinated obligations, and interest was payable in cash in arrears at a fixed rate of 0.75% on January 15 and July 15 of each year. During fiscal 2019, the 2018 Notes were converted by note holders and we repaid the $350 million principal balance in cash. We also distributed approximately 1.5 million shares of our Class A common stock to note holders during fiscal 2019, which represented the conversion value in excess of the principal amount.
In June 2013, we issued 1.50% convertible senior notes due July 15, 2020, with a principal amount of $250 million. The 2020 Notes were unsecured, unsubordinated obligations, and interest was payable in cash in arrears at a fixed rate of 1.50% on January 15 and July 15 of each year. During fiscal 2021, the 2020 Notes were converted by note holders and we repaid the $250 million principal balance in cash. We also distributed approximately 1.7 million shares of our Class A common stock to note holders during fiscal 2021, which represents the conversion value in excess of the principal amount.
In September 2017, we issued 0.25% convertible senior notes due October 1, 2022, with a principal amount of $1.15 billion. The 2022 Notes are unsecured, unsubordinated obligations, and interest is payable in cash in arrears at a fixed rate of 0.25% on April 1 and October 1 of each year. The 2022 Notes mature on October 1, 2022, unless repurchased or converted in accordance with their terms prior to such date. We cannot redeem the 2022 Notes prior to maturity.
The terms of the 2022 Notes are governed by an Indenture by and between us and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as Trustee. Upon conversion, holders of the 2022 Notes will receive cash, shares of Class A common stock, or a combination of cash and shares of Class A common stock, at our election.
The initial conversion rate for the 2022 Notes is 6.7982 shares of Class A common stock per $1,000 principal amount, which is equal to an initial conversion price of approximately $147.10 per share of Class A common stock, subject to adjustment. Prior to the close of business on May 31, 2022, conversion of the 2022 Notes is subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, as described below.
Holders of the 2022 Notes who convert their 2022 Notes in connection with certain corporate events that constitute a make-whole fundamental change (as defined in the Indenture) are, under certain circumstances, entitled to an increase in the conversion rate. Additionally, in the event of a corporate event that constitutes a fundamental change (as defined in the Indenture), holders of the 2022 Notes may require us to repurchase all or a portion of their 2022 Notes at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 2022 Notes, plus any accrued and unpaid interest.
Holders of the 2022 Notes may convert all or a portion of their 2022 Notes prior to the close of business on May 31, 2022, in multiples of $1,000 principal amount, only under the following circumstances:
•if the last reported sale price of our Class A common stock for at least 20 trading days during a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding fiscal quarter is greater than or equal to 130% of the conversion price of the 2022 Notes on each applicable trading day;
•during the five business day period after any five consecutive trading day period in which the trading price per $1,000 principal amount of the 2022 Notes for each day of that five day consecutive trading day period was less than 98% of the product of the last reported sale price of Class A common stock and the conversion rate of the 2022 Notes on such trading day; or
•upon the occurrence of specified corporate events, as noted in the Indenture.
On or after June 1, 2022, holders of the 2022 Notes may convert their 2022 Notes at any time until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date of the 2022 Notes.
The 2022 Notes became convertible at the option of the holders during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 and continue to be convertible in the first quarter of fiscal 2022 since the trigger for early conversion was met. Specifically, the last reported sale price of our Class A common stock exceeded 130% of the conversion price of the 2022 Notes for more than 20 trading days during the 30 consecutive trading days ended October 31, 2020, and January 31, 2021. Accordingly, the 2022 Notes are classified as current on the consolidated balance sheet as of January 31, 2021. Through the date of this filing, the amount of the principal balance of the 2022 Notes that has been converted or for which conversion has been requested was not material.
In accounting for the issuance of the Notes, we separated each of the Notes into liability and equity components. The carrying amounts of the liability components were calculated by measuring the fair value of similar liabilities that do not have associated convertible features. The carrying amounts of the equity components representing the conversion option were determined by deducting the fair value of the liability components from the par value of the respective Notes. These differences represent debt discounts that are amortized to interest expense over the respective terms of the Notes using the effective interest rate method. The gross carrying amounts of the equity components recorded were $77 million, $68 million, and $223 million for the 2018 Notes, 2020 Notes, and 2022 Notes, respectively, and were included in Additional paid-in capital on the consolidated balance sheets upon issuance. The equity components are not remeasured as long as they continue to meet the conditions for equity classification. The effective interest rate of the liability component was 5.75%, 6.25%, 4.60% for the 2018 Notes, 2020 Notes, and 2022 Notes, respectively. The interest rates were based on the interest rates of similar liabilities at the time of issuance that did not have associated convertible features.
In accounting for the issuance costs related to the Notes, we allocated the total amount of issuance costs incurred to liability and equity components based on their relative values. Issuance costs attributable to the liability components are being amortized on a straight-line basis, which approximates the effective interest rate method, to interest expense over the respective terms of the Notes. The issuance costs attributable to the equity components were netted against the respective equity components in Additional paid-in capital. Upon issuance of the 2018 Notes, we recorded liability issuance costs of $7 million and equity issuance costs of $2 million; upon issuance of the 2020 Notes, we recorded liability issuance costs of $5 million and equity issuance costs of $2 million; and upon issuance of the 2022 Notes, we recorded liability issuance costs of $14 million and equity issuance costs of $4 million.
Notes Hedges
In connection with the issuance of the Notes, we entered into convertible note hedge transactions with respect to our Class A common stock (“Purchased Options”). The Purchased Options are intended to offset potential economic dilution to our Class A common stock upon any conversion of the Notes. The Purchased Options are separate transactions and are not part of the terms of the Notes. The amounts paid for the Purchased Options are included in Additional paid-in capital on the consolidated balance sheets.
The Purchased Options relating to the 2018 Notes gave us the option to purchase, subject to anti-dilution adjustments substantially identical to those in the 2018 Notes, approximately 4.2 million shares of our Class A common stock for $83.28 per share, exercisable upon conversion of the 2018 Notes. During the second quarter of fiscal 2019, we received approximately 1.5 million shares of our Class A common stock from the exercise of the Purchased Options relating to the 2018 Notes. These shares were recorded as treasury stock.
The Purchased Options relating to the 2020 Notes gave us the option to purchase, subject to anti-dilution adjustments substantially identical to those in the 2020 Notes, approximately 3.1 million shares of our Class A common stock for $81.74 per share, exercisable upon conversion of the 2020 Notes. During the second quarter of fiscal 2021, we received approximately 1.7 million shares of our Class A common stock from the exercise of the Purchased Options relating to the 2020 Notes. These shares were recorded as treasury stock.
The Purchased Options relating to the 2022 Notes give us the option to purchase, subject to anti-dilution adjustments substantially identical to those in the 2022 Notes, approximately 7.8 million shares of our Class A common stock for $147.10 per share, exercisable upon conversion of the 2022 Notes. The Purchased Options relating to the 2022 Notes will expire in 2022, if not exercised earlier.
Warrants
In connection with the issuance of the Notes, we also entered into warrant transactions to sell warrants (“Warrants”) to acquire, subject to anti-dilution adjustments, up to approximately 4.2 million shares over 60 scheduled trading days beginning in October 2018, 3.1 million shares over 60 scheduled trading days beginning in October 2020, and 7.8 million shares over 60 scheduled trading days beginning in January 2023 of our Class A common stock at an exercise price of $107.96, $107.96, and $213.96 per share, respectively. If the Warrants are not exercised on their exercise dates, they will expire. The Warrants will be net share settled, and the resulting number of shares of our common stock we will issue depends on the daily volume-weighted average stock prices over the 60 scheduled trading day period beginning on the first expiration date of the Warrants. If the market value per share of our Class A common stock exceeds the applicable exercise price of the Warrants, the Warrants will have a dilutive effect on our earnings per share, assuming that we are profitable. The Warrants are separate transactions and are not part of the terms of the Notes or the Purchased Options. The proceeds from the sale of the Warrants are recorded in Additional paid-in capital on the consolidated balance sheets.
During the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2019, Warrants related to the 2018 Notes were exercised, and we distributed approximately 1.1 million shares of our Class A common stock to warrant holders primarily utilizing treasury stock. As of January 31, 2019, there were no Warrants outstanding related to the 2018 Notes.
During the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2021, Warrants related to the 2020 Notes were exercised, and we distributed approximately 1.6 million shares of our Class A common stock to warrant holders primarily utilizing treasury stock. As of January 31, 2021, there were no Warrants outstanding related to the 2020 Notes.

Related-Party Lease Transactions
We lease certain office space from an affiliate of our Chairman of the Board of Directors, Mr. Duffield, adjacent to our corporate headquarters in Pleasanton, California, under various lease agreements. As of January 31, 2021, and 2020, operating lease right-of-use assets related to these agreements were $134 million and $57 million, respectively, and operating lease liabilities were $146 million and $70 million, respectively. The weighted average remaining lease term of these agreements is eight years. The total rent expense under these agreements was $16 million, $13 million, and $11 million for fiscal 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively.
During fiscal 2021, we entered into an agreement with this affiliated party for a fee of $2 million for an option to purchase these leased properties at a price based on third-party appraisals and negotiation between Workday and the affiliated party. If the Leased Property Purchase Option was not exercised by March 1, 2021, the existing lease agreements would have been automatically renewed for four years beyond the current lease end dates at rates determined based on independent third-party evaluations. We accounted for this arrangement, which was approved by our Board of Directors, as a lease modification during the third quarter of fiscal 2021, as we were not reasonably certain that the option to purchase the leased facilities would be exercised. As of January 31, 2021, this assessment did not change. On February 23, 2021, our Board of Directors approved the exercise of this Leased Property Purchase Option to purchase the leased properties. See Note 22, Subsequent Events for further details.
Note 13. Commitments and Contingencies
Third-Party Hosted Infrastructure Platform-Related Commitments

Legal Matters
We are a party to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business. We make a provision for a liability relating to legal matters when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. These provisions are reviewed at least quarterly and adjusted to reflect the impacts of negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel, and other information and events pertaining to a particular matter. In our opinion, as of January 31, 2021, there was not at least a reasonable possibility that we had incurred a material loss, or a material loss in excess of a recorded accrual, with respect to such loss contingencies.
Note 14. Stockholders’ Equity
Common Stock
As of January 31, 2021, there were 184 million shares of Class A common stock, net of treasury stock, and 59 million shares of Class B common stock outstanding. The rights of the holders of Class A common stock and Class B common stock are identical, except with respect to voting and conversion. Each share of Class A common stock is entitled to one vote per share and each share of Class B common stock is entitled to ten votes per share. Each share of Class B common stock can be converted into a share of Class A common stock at any time at the option of the holder. All of our Class A and Class B shares will convert to a single class of common stock upon the date that is the first to occur of (i) October 17, 2032, (ii) such time as the shares of Class B common stock represent less than 9% of the outstanding Class A common stock and Class B common stock, (iii) nine months following the death of both Mr. Duffield and Mr. Bhusri, and (iv) the date on which the holders of a majority of the shares of Class B common stock elect to convert all shares of Class A common stock and Class B common stock into a single class of common stock.
Employee Equity Plans
Our 2012 Equity Incentive Plan (“EIP”) serves as the successor to our 2005 Stock Plan (together with the EIP, the “Stock Plans”). As of January 31, 2021, we had approximately 63 million shares of Class A common stock available for future grants.
In connection with the acquisition of Adaptive Insights, we assumed unvested awards that had been granted under the Adaptive Insights, Inc. 2013 Equity Incentive Plan.
We also have a 2012 Employee Stock Purchase Plan. Under the ESPP, eligible employees are granted options to purchase shares at the lower of 85% of the fair market value of the stock at the time of grant or 85% of the fair market value at the time of exercise. Options to purchase shares are granted twice yearly on or about June 1, and December 1, and exercisable on or about the succeeding November 30, and May 31, respectively, of each year. As of January 31, 2021, approximately 4 million shares of Class A common stock were available for issuance under the ESPP.
Restricted Stock Units
The Stock Plans provide for the issuance of RSUs to employees and non-employees. RSUs generally vest over four years. A summary of information related to RSU activity during fiscal 2021 is as follows:
Number of Shares Weighted-Average Grant Date Fair Value
Balance as of January 31, 2020 11,914,064 $ 147.96
RSUs granted 8,188,933 152.70
RSUs vested (5,761,931) 138.27
RSUs forfeited (1,173,400) 150.73
Balance as of January 31, 2021 13,167,666 154.90
The weighted-average grant date fair value of RSUs granted during fiscal 2021, 2020, and 2019 was $152.70, $187.89, and $129.62, respectively. The total fair value of RSUs vested as of the vesting dates during fiscal 2021, 2020, and 2019 was $1.1 billion, $1.2 billion, and $801 million, respectively.
As of January 31, 2021, there was a total of $1.8 billion in unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested RSUs, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately three years.
Performance-Based Restricted Stock Units
During fiscal 2021, 0.6 million shares of PRSUs were granted to all employees other than executive management that included both service conditions and performance conditions related to company-wide goals. These performance conditions were met and the PRSU awards will vest if the individual employee continues to provide service through the vesting date of March 15, 2021. During fiscal 2021, we recognized $91 million in compensation cost related to these PRSUs, and as of January 31, 2021, there was a total of $18 million in unrecognized compensation cost which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately two months.
During fiscal 2020, 0.6 million shares of PRSUs were granted to all employees other than executive management that included both service conditions and performance conditions related to company-wide goals. These performance conditions were met and the PRSUs vested on March 15, 2020. During fiscal 2021, we recognized $19 million in compensation cost related to these PRSUs.
Stock Options
The Stock Plans provide for the issuance of incentive and nonstatutory stock options to employees and non-employees. Stock options issued under the Stock Plans generally are exercisable for periods not to exceed ten years and generally vest over five years. A summary of information related to stock option activity during fiscal 2021 is as follows (in millions, except share and per share data):
Outstanding Stock Options Weighted-Average Exercise Price Aggregate Intrinsic Value
Balance as of January 31, 2020 3,435,577 $ 9.78 $ 601
Stock options exercised (2,117,729) 6.70

Exercisable as of January 31, 2021 1,148,056 11.64 248
The total grant date fair value of stock options vested during fiscal 2021, 2020, and 2019 was $23 million, $37 million, and $29 million, respectively. The total intrinsic value of stock options exercised during fiscal 2021, 2020, and 2019 was $396 million, $407 million, and $261 million, respectively. The intrinsic value is the difference between the current fair value of the stock and the exercise price of the stock option. The weighted-average remaining contractual life of vested and expected to vest stock options as of January 31, 2021, is approximately three years.
As of January 31, 2021, there was a total of $9 million in unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested assumed stock options, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately one year.
The stock options that are exercisable as of January 31, 2021, have a weighted-average remaining contractual life of approximately two years. The weighted-average remaining contractual life of outstanding stock options as of January 31, 2021, is approximately three years.
There were no stock options granted during fiscal 2021, 2020, and 2019, and no stock options assumed during fiscal 2021 and 2020. The weighted-average grant date fair value of stock options assumed during fiscal 2019 was $100.69. The fair value of stock options assumed was estimated using the following assumptions:
Year Ended January 31, 2019
Expected volatility 31.5% - 34.3%
Expected term (in years) 0.03 - 2.42
Risk-free interest rate 2.10% - 2.72%

Note 15. Unearned Revenue and Performance Obligations
Subscription services revenue of $2.2 billion, $1.8 billion, and $1.4 billion was recognized during fiscal 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively, that was included in the unearned revenue balances at the beginning of the respective periods. Professional services revenue recognized in the same periods from unearned revenue balances at the beginning of the respective periods was not material.
Transaction Price Allocated to the Remaining Performance Obligations
As of January 31, 2021, approximately $10.09 billion of revenue is expected to be recognized from remaining performance obligations for subscription contracts. We expect to recognize revenue on approximately $6.53 billion of these remaining performance obligations over the next 24 months, with the balance recognized thereafter. Revenue from remaining performance obligations for professional services contracts as of January 31, 2021, was not material.
Note 16. Other Income (Expense), Net

As a result of our history of net operating losses, the current provision for income taxes primarily relates to state income taxes and the current foreign provision from our profitable foreign entities. The foreign deferred income tax benefit primarily relates to the excess of tax benefit from share-based compensation in certain foreign jurisdictions.
Significant components of our deferred tax assets and liabilities were as follows (in thousands):
January 31,
2021 2020
Deferred tax assets:
Unearned revenue $ 17,502 $ 20,613

Net deferred tax assets $ 9,391 $ 5,969
We regularly assess the need for a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets by considering both positive and negative evidence related to whether it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets will be realized. In evaluating the need for a valuation allowance, we consider the cumulative losses in recent years as a significant piece of negative evidence that is generally difficult to overcome. As of January 31, 2021, we continue to maintain a full valuation allowance against our U.S. federal, state, and certain foreign jurisdiction deferred tax assets.
As of January 31, 2021, we recorded a valuation allowance of $2.1 billion for the portion of the deferred tax assets that we do not expect to be realized. The valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets increased by $180 million and $340 million during fiscal 2021 and 2020, respectively. The increase in the valuation allowance during fiscal 2021 is mainly due to an increase in deferred tax assets on our net operating losses and research and development credits during the fiscal year.
As of January 31, 2021, we had approximately $3.8 billion of federal, $2.6 billion of state, and $1.9 billion of foreign net operating loss and other tax attributes carryforwards available to offset future taxable income. If not utilized, the pre-fiscal 2018 federal and the state net operating loss carryforwards expire in varying amounts between fiscal 2022 and 2041. The federal net operating losses generated in and after fiscal 2018 and the foreign net operating losses and other tax attributes do not expire and may be carried forward indefinitely.
We also had approximately $223 million of federal and $213 million of California research and development tax credit carryforwards as of January 31, 2021. The federal credits expire in varying amounts between fiscal 2023 and 2041. The California research credits do not expire and may be carried forward indefinitely.
Our ability to utilize the net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards in the future may be subject to substantial restrictions in the event of past or future ownership changes as defined in Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and similar state tax law.
We intend to permanently reinvest any future earnings in our foreign operations unless such earnings are subject to U.S. federal income taxes. As of January 31, 2021, we estimate any such hypothetical foreign withholding tax expense to be immaterial to our financial statements.
A reconciliation of the gross unrecognized tax benefit is as follows (in thousands):
Year Ended January 31,
2021 2020 2019
Unrecognized tax benefits at the beginning of the period $ 143,621 $ 130,771 $ 107,849
Additions for tax positions taken in prior years 4,640 309 10,586
Reductions for tax positions taken in prior years (2,347) - -
Additions for tax positions related to the current year 15,158 13,109 12,336
Reductions related to a lapse of applicable statute of limitations (807) (568) -
Reductions related to settlements (403) - -
Unrecognized tax benefits at the end of the period $ 159,862 $ 143,621 $ 130,771
Our policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within our provision for income taxes. We did not accrue any material interest expense or penalties during fiscal 2021, 2020, or 2019.
Of the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits of $160 million, $1 million, if recognized, would impact the effective tax rate as of January 31, 2021.
We file federal, state, and foreign income tax returns in jurisdictions with varying statutes of limitations. Due to our net operating loss carryforwards, our income tax returns generally remain subject to examination by federal and most state and foreign tax authorities.
On June 22, 2020, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear the appeal of a ruling by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit regarding the treatment of stock-based compensation expenses in a cost-sharing agreement (Altera Corporation & Subsidiaries v. Commissioner). The U.S. Supreme Court decision resulted in an immaterial reduction in our deferred tax assets relative to the total gross deferred tax assets, which was fully offset by our valuation allowance. As a result, there was no net impact on our consolidated financial statements.
On March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (“CARES Act”) was signed into law in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The CARES Act includes temporary changes to income and non-income based tax laws. We evaluated the applicable provisions of the CARES Act and determined that there is no material impact to our financial results.
Note 18. Net Loss Per Share
Basic net loss per share attributable to common stockholders is computed by dividing the net loss attributable to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period, net of treasury stock. Diluted net loss per share is computed by giving effect to all potential shares of common stock, including our outstanding stock options, unvested RSUs and PRSUs, common stock related to convertible senior notes to the extent dilutive, outstanding warrants, and common stock issuable pursuant to the ESPP. Basic and diluted net loss per share was the same for each period presented, as the inclusion of all potential common shares outstanding would have been anti-dilutive.
The net loss per share attributable to common stockholders is allocated based on the contractual participation rights of the Class A common shares and Class B common shares as if the loss for the period had been distributed. As the liquidation and dividend rights are identical, the net loss attributable to common stockholders is allocated on a proportionate basis.
The following table presents the calculation of basic and diluted net loss attributable to common stockholders per share (in thousands, except per share data):

Note 22. Subsequent Events
Peakon
On January 28, 2021, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Peakon ApS, an employee success platform that converts feedback into actionable insights, for consideration of approximately $700 million in cash, subject to adjustments. The acquisition is expected to close during our first quarter of fiscal 2022, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including required regulatory approvals.
Exercise of Leased Property Purchase Option
As discussed in Note 12, Leases, we entered into an agreement with an affiliated party during fiscal 2021 which gives us the option to purchase certain leased properties. On February 23, 2021, our Board of Directors approved the exercise of this Leased Property Purchase Option to purchase the leased properties. This purchase provides long-term stability to our corporate headquarter footprint in Pleasanton, California. The purchase price is $173 million in cash, reduced by the $2 million fee paid for the Leased Property Purchase Option. The transaction is expected to be completed in the first quarter of fiscal 2022. The net carrying value of the properties purchased will be $159 million at the time of purchase, which is calculated as the net purchase price of $171 million, reduced by the difference between the carrying values of the right-of-use asset and lease liability of the leased properties immediately prior to the purchase of approximately $12 million.","ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE
None.","ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
(a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officers and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act as of the end of the period covered by this report.
In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs.
Based on management’s evaluation, our principal executive officers and principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to, and are effective to, provide assurance at a reasonable level that the information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officers and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.
(b) Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria set forth in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework). Based on the assessment, management has concluded that its internal control over financial reporting was effective as of January 31, 2021, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP. Our independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP, has issued an audit report with respect to our internal control over financial reporting, which appears in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and is incorporated herein by reference.
(c) Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officers and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of any changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(d) and 15d-15(d) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during our most recently completed fiscal quarter. Based on that evaluation, our principal executive officers and principal financial officer concluded that there has not been any material change in our internal control over financial reporting during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 that materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting, despite the fact that the majority of our employees are continuing to work remotely due to the COVID-19 pandemic. We are continually monitoring and assessing the COVID-19 situation on our internal controls to understand the potential impact on their design and operating effectiveness.
(d) Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures and Internal Control over Financial Reporting
In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs.

Overview
We founded CrowdStrike in 2011 to reinvent security for the cloud era. When we started the company, cyberattackers had a decided, asymmetric advantage over existing security products. We turned the tables on the adversaries by taking a fundamentally new approach that leverages the network effects of crowdsourced data applied to modern technologies such as AI, cloud computing, and graph databases. Realizing that the nature of cybersecurity problems had changed but the solutions had not, we built our CrowdStrike Falcon platform to detect threats and stop breaches.
We believe we are defining a new category called the Security Cloud, with the power to transform the security industry much the same way the cloud has transformed the customer relationship management, human resources, and service management industries. With our Falcon platform, we created the first multi-tenant, cloud native, intelligent security solution capable of protecting workloads across on-premise, virtualized, and cloud-based environments running on a variety of endpoints such as desktops, laptops, servers, virtual machines, cloud workloads, cloud containers, mobile, and IoT devices. Our Falcon platform is composed of two tightly integrated proprietary technologies: our easily deployed intelligent lightweight agent and our cloud-based, dynamic graph database called Threat Graph. Our solution benefits from crowdsourcing and economies of scale, which we believe enables our AI algorithms to be uniquely effective. We call this cloud-scale AI. Our single lightweight agent is installed on each endpoint or the cloud workload and provides local detection and prevention capabilities while also intelligently collecting and streaming high fidelity data to our platform for real-time decision-making. Our Threat Graph processes, correlates, and analyzes this data in the cloud using a combination of AI and behavioral pattern-matching techniques. By analyzing and correlating information across our massive, crowdsourced dataset, we are able to deploy our AI algorithms at cloud-scale and build a more intelligent, effective solution to detect threats and stop breaches that on-premise or single instance cloud products cannot match. Today, we offer 19 cloud modules and our Falcon platform via a SaaS subscription-based model that spans multiple large markets, including corporate workload security, security and vulnerability management, managed security services, IT operations management, threat intelligence services, identity protection and log management.
Organizations everywhere are becoming more distributed as they adopt the cloud, increase workforce mobility, and grow their number of connected devices. They are adding more workloads to a myriad of different endpoints beyond the traditional security perimeter, exposing an increasingly broad attack surface to adversaries. In addition, the sophistication of cyberattacks has increased, often coming from nation-states, well-funded criminal organizations, and hackers using advanced, easily obtained methods of attack. On a number of occasions, adversaries have launched devastating, destructive attacks that have caused significant business disruption and billions of dollars in cumulative losses. The architectural limitations of legacy security products, coupled with a dynamic and intensifying threat landscape, are creating the need for a fundamentally new approach to security.
Our pioneering approach starts with our single intelligent lightweight agent that enables frictionless deployment of our platform at scale. Our customers can rapidly adopt our technology across any type of workload running on a variety of endpoints. Our lightweight agent offloads computationally intensive tasks to the cloud, while retaining local detection and prevention capabilities that are necessary on the endpoint. The agent is nonintrusive to the end user and continues to protect the endpoint and track activity even when offline. The agent recommences transmitting data to our Falcon platform when the connection to the cloud has been reestablished. By utilizing CrowdStrike’s single agent, customers are able to leverage the capabilities of our platform without burdening the endpoint with multiple agents.
Our lightweight agent intelligently streams high fidelity endpoint data to the cloud where Threat Graph provides a simple, flexible, and scalable way to model highly interconnected data sets. Threat Graph processes, correlates, and analyzes over five trillion endpoint-related events per week in real time and maintains an index of these events for future use. Threat Graph continuously looks for malicious activity by applying graph analytics and AI algorithms to the data streamed from the endpoints. Our multi-tenant architecture allows us to collect a broad array of high fidelity data about both potential attacks and benign behavioral patterns across our entire customer base, continuously enhancing our AI algorithms. This significantly increases the efficacy of our solution to stop breaches while reducing false positives.
We founded our company on the principle that the future of security would be driven by AI and that a cloud-native architecture would enable the collection of high fidelity data and scalability necessary for an effective solution. From the beginning, our strategy was focused on collecting data at scale, centrally storing such data in a singular model, and training our algorithms on these vast amounts of high fidelity data, which we believe is a fundamental differentiator from our competitors. Our cloud-scale AI means that the more data that is fed into our Falcon platform, the more intelligent Threat Graph becomes and the more our customers benefit, creating a powerful network effect that increases the overall value we provide. AI is revolutionizing many technology fields, including security solutions. To be truly effective, algorithms that enable AI depend on the quality and volume of data that trains them and the selection of the right differentiating features from that data. Our proprietary algorithms in Threat Graph identify events that may or may not be directly related, but together could indicate a threat that could otherwise remain undetected. We are uniquely effective because we not only have a massive amount of high fidelity data to train our AI models but also because of our deep security expertise to guide our feature selection-all resulting in industry-leading efficacy and low false positives. Our rich set of continuously collected high fidelity endpoint data feeding our algorithms also enables us to use an active learning approach, where the models are continuously updated to fill in gaps identified in initial models and their performance is validated with this data prior to production use.
By leveraging a multi-tenant, cloud native solution, the data we analyze to stop breaches is both larger and more meaningful than the data from on-premise or single instance private cloud products. If Threat Graph discovers something in one customer environment, all customers benefit automatically and in real time. Taken together, our platform enables intelligent, dynamic automation at scale to detect threats and stop breaches.
We designed our Falcon platform with an open, interoperable, and highly extensible architecture. Because of our single data model, we only need to collect high fidelity endpoint data once from our agent, which we can use repeatedly for multiple use cases. Therefore, we can rapidly innovate, build, and deploy highly integrated modules to access additional market opportunities. Additionally, via the CrowdStrike Store, customers can discover, try, buy and deploy trusted partner applications that extend their investment in the CrowdStrike Falcon platform. We also built a rich set of APIs that allows us to ingest third-party data into our Falcon platform and allows our customers to expand the functionality of their existing security systems by writing their own programs and accessing the data on our platform.
Our Falcon platform includes our OverWatch threat hunting cloud module that combines the human intelligence of our elite security experts with the power of Threat Graph. Because our world class team can see potential attacks across our entire customer base, their expertise is enhanced by their constant visibility into the threat landscape. We are able to keep this team lean and scalable by leveraging automation and our Threat Graph. OverWatch is a force multiplier that extends the capabilities and improves the productivity of our customers’ security teams.
We offer our customers compelling business value that includes ease of adoption, rapid time-to-value, superior efficacy rates in detecting threats and preventing breaches, and reduced total cost of ownership by consolidating legacy, siloed security products in a single solution. We also allow thinly-stretched security organizations to automate previously manual tasks, freeing them to focus on their most important objectives. With the Falcon platform, organizations can transform how they combat threats, from slow, manual, and reactionary to fast, automated, and predictive, providing visibility across the entire threat lifecycle.
We primarily sell our platform and cloud modules through our direct sales team that leverages our network of channel partners to maximize effectiveness and scale. We amplify our sales presence by leveraging our technology alliance partners that can deliver, embed, or build applications with data and analytics from our Falcon platform. We are also enhancing our go-to-market strategy using a low-touch, trial-to-pay approach. In December 2017, we began to employ a trial-to-pay model in which we offer 15-day free trial access to Falcon Prevent, our next-generation antivirus module, to prospective customers directly from our website. In May 2018, we began offering Falcon Prevent for trial and purchase through the AWS Marketplace and have since expanded our modules available through the AWS Marketplace. We believe this approach enables a higher velocity of new customer acquisition and expansion, and extends our reach to customers of all sizes.
We have a low friction land-and-expand sales strategy. When customers deploy our Falcon platform, they can start with any number of cloud modules and we can activate additional cloud modules in real time on the same agent already deployed on the endpoint. Once customers experience the benefits of our Falcon platform, they often expand their adoption over time by adding more endpoints or purchasing additional modules. As of January 31, 2021, subscription customers that had adopted four or more modules, five or more modules and six or more modules increased to 63%, 47%, and 24%, respectively. Our dollar
based net retention rate, which measures expansion in existing customers’ subscriptions over a 12 month period, was 125% as of January 31, 2021, demonstrating the power of our land-and-expand strategy.
Some of the world’s largest enterprises, government organizations, and high profile brands trust CrowdStrike to protect their business. As of January 31, 2021, we had 9,896 subscription customers worldwide. We began as a large enterprise solution, but the flexibility and scalability of our Falcon platform and enhanced go-to-market approach enable us to protect customers of any size-from hundreds of thousands of endpoints to as few as one.
We have experienced significant growth, with total revenue increasing from $249.8 million for fiscal 2019 to $481.4 million for fiscal 2020, representing year-over-year growth of 93%, and from $481.4 million for fiscal 2020 to $874.4 million for fiscal 2021, representing year-over-year growth of 82%. Subscription revenue grew from $219.4 million for fiscal 2019 to $436.3 million for fiscal 2020, a 99% increase, and from $436.3 million for fiscal 2020 to $804.7 million for fiscal 2021, a 84% increase. Our annual recurring revenue, or ARR, has grown from $312.7 million as of January 31, 2019 to $600.5 million as of January 31, 2020, a 92% increase, and from $600.5 million as of January 31, 2020 to $1.1 billion as of January 31, 2021, a 75% increase. We had net losses of $92.6 million, $141.8 million, and $140.1 million in fiscal 2021, fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019, respectively. We expect to continue to incur net losses for the foreseeable future as we continue to invest in our business, and in particular, our sales and R&D capabilities, to address our large market opportunity.
Industry Background
There are a number of key trends that are driving the need for a new approach to security.
Cybersecurity Threats are Greater than Ever
Today’s cybersecurity threat landscape is more dangerous than ever. Breaches are complex and often executed over multiple steps known in the industry as the threat lifecycle. The typical threat lifecycle starts with an initial exploit to enter a system, historically using malware, but increasingly using malware-free or fileless methods, to penetrate endpoints and establish a beachhead inside the corporate perimeter. Once inside, adversaries move laterally across the corporate environment where they collect credentials and escalate privileges enabling the typical adversary to download a larger, more destructive malware program or connect with an external control source. At this stage in the threat lifecycle, the adversary is able to encrypt, destroy, or silently exfiltrate sensitive data.
Increasingly, adversaries are well-trained, possess significant technological and human resources, and are highly deliberate and targeted in their attacks. Adversaries today range from militaries and intelligence services of well-funded nation-states to sophisticated criminal organizations who are motivated by financial gains to hackers leveraging readily available advanced techniques. These groups and individuals are responsible for many breaches that involve theft or holding hostage financial data, intellectual property, and trade secrets. These attacks are pervasive, targeting a broad range of industries including technology, transportation, healthcare, financial services, governments and political organizations, utility, retail, and public infrastructure. On a number of occasions, adversaries have launched devastating, destructive attacks that have caused significant business disruption and billions of dollars in cumulative losses.
Proliferation of Workloads Expanding the Attack Surface
The rise of digital transformation, cloud computing, workforce mobility, and growth in connected devices has created a rapid expansion of workloads across endpoints and industries. As a result, devices, applications, and data are highly distributed and diverse, challenging organizations to monitor and protect all of their workloads running on various endpoints. The adoption of many of these technologies and the resulting disappearance of the corporate perimeter have expanded the attack surface and left many organizations increasingly vulnerable to breach. Today, workloads running on endpoints, such as laptops and servers, are the primary targets in a security attack since they are vulnerable and frequently are repositories of valuable and sensitive data, including intellectual property, authentication credentials, personally identifiable information, financial information, and other digital assets. As new workloads are provisioned on emerging mobile and IoT devices, oftentimes residing outside of the corporate perimeter, increasingly more sensitive and mission critical data will be generated and stored on these endpoints as well. Attacks such as Shamoon, WannaCry and NotPetya have shown that destroying or locking data on a large portion of an enterprise’s endpoints can cause widespread business disruption.
On-Premise Security Architectures are Constrained
On-premise products are siloed, lack integration, and have limited ability to collect, process, and analyze vast amounts of data-attributes that are required to be effective in today’s increasingly dynamic threat landscape. Legacy vendors often deploy more agents to the endpoint as they layer on a patchwork of additional point product capabilities. This approach burdens endpoints by consuming additional storage space, memory, and processor capacity, degrading end user experience without providing effective security. In addition, integrating and maintaining numerous products, data repositories, and infrastructures across highly distributed enterprise environments is a costly and resource-intensive process for already thinly-staffed security teams.
Other Existing Security Products have Limitations
Legacy Signature-based Products. Signature-based products are designed to detect attacks that are already cataloged in a repository of previously identified threats but are not capable of preventing unknown threats or stopping associated breaches. These signatures, known as Indicators of Compromise, or IOCs, represent a reactive method of tracking cyberattacks. By the time IOCs are located, all they provide is evidence of compromise or breach that may have already resulted in substantial losses to the victim. If an attack vector is even slightly modified, a signature-based approach will no longer detect the attack and will fail to stop the breach. Many significant breaches seen in the last two decades have involved the failure of a legacy signature-based antivirus product to detect a previously unknown or modified version of a previously known attack.
Malware-focused Machine Learning Products. Traditionally, organizations have focused on protecting their networks and endpoints against malware-based attacks. These attacks involve malware built for the specific purpose of performing malicious activities, stealing data, or destroying systems. A malware-centric defensive approach will leave the organization vulnerable to attacks that do not leverage malware.
Application Whitelisting Products. Application whitelisting products resort to an “always allow” or “always block” policy on an endpoint in order to allow or prevent processes from executing. Whitelisting relies in part on manually creating and maintaining a complex list of rules, burdening end users and IT organizations. In order to avoid these management challenges, IT organizations often create special exceptions to the whitelist that attackers leverage to compromise endpoints. Furthermore, fileless attacks can exploit legitimate whitelisted applications, compromising the integrity of the whitelisting product.
Network-centric Security Products. Traditional network security vendors have focused their products on perimeter-based protection. However, these approaches have decreased in relevance and effectiveness as employees and workplace devices have expanded beyond the firewall and the use of encrypted traffic has increased creating blind spots and vulnerabilities that attackers are able to exploit. As the number of endpoints proliferates, and workforces become more distributed, this layer of defense cannot adequately protect information-rich endpoints and workloads that are outside the corporate perimeter.
Bolt-on Cloud Products. Many on-premise vendors have introduced cloud offerings by putting their on-premise products in the cloud. Such single-tenant products were not designed to run in the cloud and therefore continue to be siloed, lack integration, and possess limited scalability to identify threats across their customer base in real time. In addition, such products are complex to deploy, difficult to scale, brittle to maintain, costly to own, and can be ineffective in stopping breaches. Any product that was originally designed for on-premise deployments and migrated to the cloud cannot by definition be a cloud native solution.
Creation of the Security Cloud
Over the last 17 years, cloud computing has revolutionized many industries in enterprise software and created significant shifts in market share away from incumbents with on-premise or single instance cloud offerings. The cloud has enabled organizations to cost-efficiently scale their compute and storage resources, accelerate innovation, eliminate ongoing maintenance and administrative costs, and consolidate previously disparate and siloed products. During this period, new data technologies also emerged leveraging the cloud to enable more data collection, improve data analysis, and share key insights to drive better business outcomes and make more informed decisions.
The purpose-built, cloud native leaders that began from scratch with multi-tenant architectures, single data models, and SaaS business models have defined entirely new categories such as CRM Cloud, HR Cloud, and Service Management Cloud. We believe we are doing the same for security.
An effective solution to address the modern cybersecurity threat landscape should combine multiple methods into an integrated, data-driven, and automated cloud-based platform in order to provide comprehensive breach protection across the entire threat lifecycle. Such a platform requires collecting, processing, analyzing, and correlating vast amounts of high fidelity endpoint events in the cloud. This platform needs to operate at web-scale, process events in real time, and benefit from the network effects of crowdsourced data to understand attacks that happen across millions of endpoints. We believe only a cloud native approach can address today’s threat landscape.
We believe we are defining a new category called the Security Cloud.
Our Solution
With our Falcon platform, we created the first multi-tenant, cloud native, intelligent security solution capable of protecting workloads across on-premise, virtualized, and cloud-based environments running on a variety of endpoints such as desktops, laptops, servers, virtual machines, cloud workloads, cloud containers, mobile, and IoT devices. Our solution consists of our single intelligent lightweight agent and our powerful and dynamic cloud-based database Threat Graph. These two tightly integrated proprietary technologies continually collect, process, analyze and correlate vast amounts of high fidelity data across the entire threat lifecycle using a combination of AI and behavioral pattern-matching techniques to stop breaches. We implement this approach by crowdsourcing data across our entire customer base and taking advantage of economies of scale, which we believe enables our AI algorithms to be uniquely effective. The benefits of our cloud-based AI are automatically shared with customers across our community in real time. We combine multiple methods of detection, prevention, and response to known and unknown threats as well as malware and malware-free techniques across the threat lifecycle.
Our Falcon platform supports 19 cloud modules via a SaaS subscription-based model that spans multiple large markets, including corporate workload security, security and vulnerability management, managed security services, IT operations management, threat intelligence services, identity protection and log management. Our single data model and open cloud architecture enable us and third-party partners to rapidly innovate, build, and deploy new cloud modules to provide our customers with additional functionality across a myriad of use cases.
We designed our platform to be rapidly deployable, easy to use, and extensible, with the ability to consolidate point security products that have historically led to data silos and agent sprawl, into one comprehensive and integrated solution. Our platform allows our customers’ thinly-staffed security organizations to spend less time and fewer resources provisioning hardware, configuring supporting software systems, and performing ongoing maintenance work, freeing them to focus on their most important objectives. We aim to transform how organizations combat threats from slow, manual, and reactionary to fast, automated, and predictive.
Key Benefits of Our Solution
•The Power of the Crowd. Our crowdsourced data enables all of our customers to benefit from contributing to Threat Graph. As more high fidelity data is fed into our Falcon platform, there is more data to train our AI models with, increasing the overall efficacy of our Falcon platform. This benefits our customers and supports our efforts to gain more customers, creating a powerful network effect. Threat Graph can then learn and identify warning signs once and rapidly deliver protection to every customer in our community. Further, our AI algorithms are more effective because they are trained on such a broad and representative set of data that captures information about potential attacks throughout the entire threat lifecycle across our customer base.
•High Efficacy with Low False Positives. Our Falcon platform collects, processes, correlates, and analyzes high fidelity data on both real-world attacks and benign behavioral patterns to continually train and enhance our algorithms resulting in industry-leading threat detection and low false positive rates.
•Consolidation of Siloed Products. Integrating and maintaining numerous products, data and infrastructures across highly distributed enterprise environments leaves blind spots that hackers can exploit and is a costly and resource-intensive process. Our integrated platform unifies cloud modules addressing cloud workload security, next-generation antivirus, endpoint detection and response (EDR), device control, host firewall management, vulnerability management, forensic analysis, IT hygiene, threat hunting, and automated threat intelligence. Our platform enables our customers to reduce or streamline their siloed and layered security products, simplifying operations while providing a comprehensive solution.
•Consolidation of Agents. We provide robust and diverse functionality through a single intelligent lightweight agent. Legacy vendors’ agents were designed to be single purpose, thus they often deploy multiple agents to the endpoint as they layer additional point product capabilities on top of their initial offering. This legacy approach burdens endpoints by consuming additional storage space, memory, and processor capacity, degrading the end user experience. Our single agent approach allows customers to consolidate and remove numerous agents from their infrastructure and restore endpoint performance. Because we collect data once from our agent and use it across multiple use cases, the Falcon platform can offer a wide range of functionality without burdening the endpoint.
•Rapid Time to Value. On-premise security solutions take time to install, configure, deploy, and maintain. We streamline the deployment process by providing cloud-delivered security with protection policies that work from day one, eliminating lengthy implementation periods and professional services engagements. Moreover, once a customer deploys our lightweight agent on their endpoints, we can activate additional cloud modules in real time.
•Constant Protection Anywhere. Our cloud-based model allows us to secure customer workloads such as desktops, laptops, servers, virtual machines, cloud workloads, cloud containers, mobile, and IoT devices. In addition, once our agent is deployed on an endpoint it continues to protect the endpoint and track activity even when offline.
•Elite Security Team as a Force Multiplier. Our OverWatch threat hunting cloud module combines world class human intelligence from our elite security experts with the power of Threat Graph. OverWatch is a force multiplier that extends the capabilities and improves the productivity of our customers’ security teams. Because our world class team can see attacks across our entire customer base, their expertise is enhanced by their constant visibility into the threat landscape.
•Bridging the Security Skills Gap through Automation. Our solution automates certain previously manual tasks, freeing up personnel to focus on their most important objectives. Our Falcon Complete module provides a turnkey solution that combines endpoint security with remediation and response capabilities.
•Lowering Total Cost of Ownership. Our cloud-based platform eliminates our customers’ need for initial or ongoing purchases of hardware and does not require their personnel to configure, implement or integrate disparate point products. Additionally, our comprehensive platform reduces overall personnel costs associated with ongoing maintenance, as well as the need for software patches and upgrades for separate products.
Growth Strategy
Key elements of our growth strategy include:
•Growing Our Customer Base by Replacing Legacy and Other Endpoint Security Products. Given the limitations of existing legacy and other endpoint security products, many organizations are replacing their existing legacy and other endpoint security products with our Falcon platform. We grew our subscription customer base by 4,465 customers from 5,431 at January 31, 2020, to 9,896 at January 31, 2021, representing an 82% increase. We will continue to invest in customer acquisition programs, including our channel partnerships and new programs, like our free trial program of Falcon Prevent that is easily downloaded from our website and AWS Marketplace.
•Further Penetrating Existing Customers. Our growth will depend in part on our ability to continue to expand our relationships with our customers by deploying on additional endpoints in their environment and cross selling more cloud modules. When customers deploy our lightweight agent, they can easily add additional cloud modules. We also offer in-application trial usage of additional modules to cross-sell to existing customers. While some new customers initially deploy our Falcon platform broadly across the organization, others elect to deploy only in selected business units and later deploy on additional endpoints and subscribe to additional modules. Over time, we seek to deploy our solution enterprise wide for all customers. The power of our land-and-expand strategy is evidenced by our 125% dollar-based net retention rate as of January 31, 2021.
•Leveraging Our Falcon Platform to Enter New Markets. Because we leverage a single data model and open cloud architecture, we are uniquely positioned to continue innovating and rapidly deploying new cloud modules on our platform. For example, Falcon Discover includes use cases outside of security, such as application license management, AWS spend analysis, and asset inventory. Because our lightweight agent collects diverse endpoint data
once for repeated use, we can expand our addressable market by rapidly adding new cloud modules that leverage this data. We intend to continue to develop new cloud modules for broader endpoint use cases.
•Broadening Our Reach into New Customer Segments. While we initially targeted large sophisticated enterprises, we have expanded our go-to-market efforts to include customers of all sizes with a dedicated inside sales team focused on smaller organizations. We also released Falcon Complete in 2018, our turnkey solution that combines the most popular cloud modules of our Falcon platform with our remediation and response capabilities, to create a solution for customers with limited or no internal security expertise. As a result, we can sell our Falcon platform to the largest enterprises or smallest businesses with any level of security sophistication and budget. We continue to look for new ways to broaden our reach into new customer segments.
•Extending Our Falcon Platform and Ecosystem. We designed our architecture to be open, interoperable, and highly extensible. We launched the CrowdStrike Store, the first open cloud-based application PaaS for cybersecurity, which provides an ecosystem of trusted partners and applications for our customers. In the future we plan to continue investing in the CrowdStrike Store to empower our partners by making it easier to build applications and to enable our customers to more easily discover, try, and purchase additional cloud modules from both trusted partners and us.
•Broadening Our Reach into the U.S. Federal Government Vertical. We are investing in the acquisition of customers in the U.S. federal government vertical. Our platform is authorized by several federal agencies via the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (“FedRAMP”). To further meet the compliance demands of the federal government, customers can elect to deploy the Falcon platform in the AWS GovCloud. We have also successfully been embedded into several strategic government-wide cybersecurity programs and contracts, such as the Department of Homeland Security’s Continuous Diagnostics and Mitigation Approved Products List, which serves to provide federal agencies with innovative security tools.
•Expanding Our International Footprint. We are expanding our international operations and intend to invest globally to broaden our international footprint. We grew our international revenue from $124.9 million for fiscal 2020, to $247.0 million for fiscal 2021, representing an increase of 98%. We intend to grow our international customer base by increasing our investments in our overseas operations, including adding headcount in Europe, the Middle East, Asia-Pacific, and Japan and establishing overseas data centers.

Technology
We have designed an innovative architecture from the ground up to overcome the limitations of existing security products and deliver cloud-based solutions. The key design principles of our Falcon platform include:
Cloud Native Architecture. We built the Falcon platform entirely in and for the cloud, enabling collection and analysis of a massive, crowdsourced dataset from all of our customers to stop breaches. Our platform is designed to be redundant, resilient, and high performing. Delivering security from the cloud enables agility, ease of use, and protection for workloads on a variety of endpoints wherever they are located. As customer adoption grows, the network effect of each additional endpoint added to the Falcon platform will amplify the breadth and depth of our dataset and intelligence.
Falcon Agent. We designed an intelligent lightweight agent that is installed on each endpoint or cloud workload. These agents incorporate identification and prevention of known malware, machine learning for unknown malware, exploit blocking and advanced behavioral techniques, to protect workloads across all endpoints while capturing and recording high fidelity endpoint data. Our agents continue to protect workloads running on endpoints even when offline. The agent recommences transmitting data to our Falcon platform when the connection to the cloud has been re-established. Our lightweight agent is built to support Windows, Mac and Linux operating systems. The agent is hardened against attacks and uses a combination of kernel and user-mode modules to collect high fidelity endpoint events as they take place on a system. It correlates these events with a local situational model on the endpoint, analyzes via agent-based machine learning models and is capable of taking a variety of preventative and responsive actions on the endpoint, either automatically or via human control. Events are streamed by the agent to the cloud in real time in order to be further analyzed in the Threat Graph, where additional correlation and AI algorithms can be applied. The agent is also capable of being remotely reconfigured in real time based on analytics in our cloud platform in order to collect and analyze different events or take other actions.
Threat Graph. Threat Graph is a proprietary, powerful, and dynamic graph database. Threat Graph continually looks for malicious activity by combining AI with behavioral pattern-matching techniques to look beyond file features and track the behaviors of every software program executed on an endpoint in a customer’s network environment. By applying powerful graph analytics and AI algorithms to cybersecurity, we enrich the data collected with our proprietary and third-party threat intelligence, such as adversary capabilities, motivations, attributions, and threat indicators. The graph data model allows the AI algorithms to identify relationships between events that are not directly related but which could indicate an attack that would otherwise remain undetected. We believe that our AI algorithms are advantaged by the rich proprietary dataset that we use to
train them. Threat Graph provides customers with complete real time and historical visibility and insight into events occurring on their endpoints for hunting and searching.
Threat Graph also provides query and hunting capability over the full set of high fidelity events collected in the graph. This correlated data, natively represented in a graph structure, enables new products and cloud modules to be created rapidly since the platform provides the visibility, collection, correlation and actions over data as reusable building blocks. This collect-once, use repeatedly approach is the reason why we have been able to deliver new cloud modules covering IT hygiene and vulnerability management quickly and enables us to continue expanding the Falcon platform rapidly in the future.
High Fidelity Data and Smart Filtering. Absent an intelligent agent, a typical endpoint generates approximately 100 gigabytes of unfiltered system event data per day. After this data is compressed, or data shaped, a typical enterprise organization with 100,000 endpoints would generate over one petabyte of endpoint events daily. The presence of a local graph model in our agent enables it to track the state of the machine in real time, perform rapid machine learning and behavioral analysis, and provide efficient event streaming to the cloud. We call this “smart filtering.” This allows us to keep performance overhead on the endpoint to a minimum, dramatically reduce the bandwidth required for agent-cloud communication, efficiently process large volumes of data, and separate the signal from the noise. The Falcon agent collects and analyzes unfiltered data with local machine learning and behavioral algorithms on the endpoint but only streams high fidelity endpoint events to the cloud to only send what is necessary for detection, prevention and investigation of attacks. This smart filtering architecture allows us to reduce network load for customers to approximately five megabytes per endpoint per day. The Falcon platform collects an array of high fidelity endpoint events, such as code execution, network, file system and user activity. This information can be used for a variety of use cases beyond security, such as IT operations and vulnerability management.
Management Interface. The Falcon platform management interface gives customers an intuitive and informative view of their complete environment, with timely alerts and detailed search capabilities. We provide real-time endpoint and cloud workload visibility to allow customers to review details and respond to threats instantly and effectively, from anywhere, and maintain an index of these events for future use.
APIs and Integrations. Our Falcon platform and architecture is built around a rich set of APIs that efficiently and effectively complement and expand a customer’s existing security infrastructure, such as security information event management, or SIEMs, and intrusion prevention systems and intrusion detection systems. The platform includes streaming, query and batch APIs allowing customers and partners to integrate a variety of solutions seamlessly. It also includes rich management and control APIs. The platform allows third parties to develop additional cloud modules and features, furthering the power of the Falcon platform. By connecting existing security systems to the Falcon platform, we allow our customers to further leverage their security investments.
Data Center Operations
We have data center co-location facilities throughout the United States and in Europe, and we also utilize AWS data centers located in the United States and Europe. Our technology infrastructure, combined with select use of AWS resources, provides us with a distributed and scalable architecture on a global scale.
Professional Services
In addition to our Falcon platform and cloud modules, we also offer incident response and forensic investigatory services, technical assessment and strategic advisory services, as well as training to assist organizations that have experienced a breach or are assessing their security posture and ability to respond to breaches.
•Incident Response/ Forensics Services. Our incident response services typically begin by deploying our lightweight agent to a customer’s endpoints to provide comprehensive visibility and determine if an attacker is currently in the environment, what assets have been compromised, and how much damage has been done. We also provide customized remediation planning by providing a strategy to eject attackers out of the network, lock down credentials from further use, and ensure adversaries stay out. In addition to providing valuable breach remediation to our customers, our incident response services also act as a strong lead generation engine for our Falcon platform and cloud modules. After experiencing the benefits of our platform firsthand, many of our incident response customers become subscription customers. Among organizations who first became a customer after February 1, 2019, for each $1.00 spent by those
customers on their initial engagement for our incident response or proactive services, as of January 31, 2021, we derived an average of $5.51 in ARR from those subscription contracts.
•Technical Assessment and Strategic Advisory Services. Our proactive security services include technical assessment services designed to help organizations understand their cyber maturity levels. These services include cybersecurity maturity assessments, security program in-depth assessments, service organization control assessments, cloud security assessments, IT hygiene assessments and active directory security assessments. We also advise customers on readiness and preparation through the execution of table-top exercises, live fire exercises, red team/blue team assessments and advanced adversary emulation exercises. These services are designed to evaluate our customers’ security profile so they can identify areas of vulnerability, secure their network and improve their response if their defenses are breached.
•Training. We offer training and certification services to customers and partners on CrowdStrike technologies and cybersecurity topics to facilitate the adoption of CrowdStrike and to broaden and deepen their skills. CrowdStrike University is an online learning management system that organizes all CrowdStrike e-learning, instructor-led training and certification in one place, providing a personalized learning experience for individuals who have an active training subscription. Beginning the first quarter of fiscal year 2022 CrowdStrike University plans to offer proctored exam certifications through industry leading training partner Pearson Vue for its Falcon Administration, Incident Response, and Threat Hunting training programs.

Some of the world’s largest enterprises, government organizations, and high profile brands trust us to protect their business. As of January 31, 2021, we had 9,896 subscription customers worldwide. Historically, we and our channel partners have primarily sold to large organizations, but have increasingly focused on selling to small and medium-sized businesses, particularly through our trial-to-pay model. We engage our customers through our global customer and technical advisory boards in which we solicit feedback from our customers on a regular basis allowing us to understand their evolving needs. We have used this feedback to develop new cloud modules, such as Falcon Insight, and we intend to continue to develop new cloud modules based on our customer’s feedback. Our business is not dependent on any particular end customer.
Sales and Marketing
Our sales and marketing organizations work together closely to drive market awareness, build a strong sales pipeline and cultivate customer relationships to drive revenue growth.
Sales
We primarily sell subscriptions to our Falcon platform and cloud modules through our direct sales team, which is comprised of field sales and inside sales professionals who are segmented by a customer’s number of endpoints. Our sales team also leverages our network of channel partners. We also use our sales team to identify current customers who may be interested in free trials of additional cloud modules, which serves as a powerful driver of our land and expand model. By segmenting our sales teams, we can deploy a low-touch sales model that efficiently identifies prospective customers.
Marketing
Our marketing organization is focused on building our brand reputation, increasing the awareness and reputation of our platform, and driving customer demand. As part of these efforts, we deliver targeted content to demonstrate thought leadership in the security industry, including speaking engagements with the security industry’s foremost organizations to provide expert advice, issuing regular reports on the state of the industry, educating the public about the cybersecurity threats, and identifying and naming adversary groups. We also engage in paid media, web marketing, industry and trade conferences (including our annual Fal.Con conference), analyst engagements, whitepaper development, demand generation via digital and web, and targeted displacement campaigns. We employ a wide range of digital programs, including search engine marketing, online and social media initiatives, and content syndication to increase traffic to our website and encourage new customers to sign up for a 15-day free trial of the Falcon platform. Additionally, we engage in joint marketing activities with our channel and technology alliance partners. In December 2017, we began to employ a trial-to-pay model in which we offer 15-day free trial access to Falcon Prevent to prospective customers directly from our website, a program that has continued to grow over time. In May 2018, we announced that Falcon Prevent was available for trial and purchase from the AWS Marketplace and have since
expanded our modules available through the AWS Marketplace. In February 2019, we launched the CrowdStrike Store, a marketplace platform that enables customers access to third-party applications and add-on capabilities to extend the value of the Falcon platform. In 2020, we significantly expanded our technical and go-to-market alliances, including new partnerships with identity providers and business consulting firms in addition to launching new capabilities in the identity protection space.
Partnership Ecosystem
We work with a number of technology alliance partners to design go-to-market strategies that combine our platform with products or services provided by our technology alliance partners. These partner integrations deliver more secure solutions and an improved end user experience to their customers. Our technology alliance partnerships focus on security analytics, network and infrastructure security, threat platforms and orchestration, and automation. We launched the CrowdStrike Store, the first open cloud-based application PaaS for cybersecurity and the industry’s first unified security cloud ecosystem of trusted third-party applications. In addition, we recently announced the launch of Falcon for Amazon Web Services (AWS). Available in the AWS Marketplace, Falcon for AWS allows customers to easily purchase and take advantage of the metered billing (pay-as-you-go) pricing option to scale their consumption as their business needs change.
Research and Development
Our research and development organization is responsible for the design, architecture, operation and quality of our cloud native Falcon platform. In addition, the research and development organization works closely with our customer success teams to ensure customer satisfaction is the top priority.
Our success is a result of our continuous drive for innovation. Our internal team of security experts, researchers, intelligence analysts, and threat hunters continuously analyzes the evolving global threat landscape to develop products that defend against today’s most sophisticated and stealthy attacks and reports on emerging security issues. We invest substantial resources in research and development to enhance our Falcon platform, and develop new cloud modules, features and functionality. We believe timely development of new, and enhancement of our, products, services, and features is essential to maintaining our competitive position. We work closely with our customers and channel partners to gain valuable insight into their security management practices to assist us in designing new cloud modules and features that extend the capability of our platform. Our technical staff monitors and tests our software on a regular basis, and we also make our Falcon platform available for third-party validation. We also maintain a regular release process to update and enhance our existing solutions. In addition, we engage security consulting firms to perform periodic vulnerability analysis of our solutions.
Our research and development leadership team is located in Seattle, Washington and Sunnyvale, California. We also maintain research and development centers in Irvine, California, and Israel. We employ subject matter experts in a number of jurisdictions around the world. We plan to continue to dedicate significant resources to research and development.
Competition
The market for our services is intensely competitive and characterized by rapid changes in technology, customer requirements, and industry standards and by frequent new product and service offerings and improvements. We compete with an array of established and emerging security solution vendors. Conditions in our market could change rapidly and significantly as a result of technological advancements, partnerships, or acquisitions by our competitors or continuing market consolidation. With the introduction of new technologies and market entrants, we expect the competitive environment to remain intense. Our competitors include the following by general category:
•legacy antivirus product providers, such as McAfee, LLC, Broadcom Inc.’s Symantec Enterprise division, and Microsoft Corporation, who offer a broad range of approaches and solutions with traditional antivirus and signature-based protection;
•alternative endpoint security providers, such as BlackBerry Cylance, VMware Carbon Black and SentinelOne, who offer point products based on malware-only or application whitelisting techniques; and
•network security vendors, such as Palo Alto Networks, Inc. and FireEye, Inc., who are supplementing their core perimeter-based offerings with endpoint security solutions.
We compete on the basis of a number of factors, including but not limited to our:
•ability to identify security threats and prevent security breaches;
•ability to integrate with other participants in the security ecosystem;
•time to value, price, and total cost of ownership;
•brand awareness, reputation, and trust in the provider’s services;
•strength of sales, marketing, and channel partner relationships; and
•customer support, incident response, and proactive services.
Although certain of our competitors enjoy greater resources, recognition, deeper customer relationships, larger existing customer bases, or more mature intellectual property portfolios, we believe that we compete favorably with respect to these factors and that we are well positioned as a leading provider of endpoint and workload security solutions.
Intellectual Property
We believe that our intellectual property rights are valuable and important to our business. We rely on trademarks, patents, copyrights, trade secrets, license agreements, intellectual property assignment agreements, confidentiality procedures, non-disclosure agreements, and employee non-disclosure and invention assignment agreements to establish and protect our proprietary rights. Though we rely in part upon these legal and contractual protections, we believe that factors such as the skills and ingenuity of our employees and the functionality and frequent enhancements to our solutions are larger contributors to our success in the marketplace.
As of January 31, 2021, we had 65 issued patents and 102 pending patent applications in the United States and other countries. Our issued patents expire between 2032 and 2039. These patents and patent applications seek to protect our proprietary inventions relevant to our business. We intend to pursue additional intellectual property protection to the extent we believe it would be beneficial and cost-effective. Despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights, they may not be respected in the future or may be invalidated, circumvented, or challenged. Our industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent claims and related litigation based on allegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. We believe that competitors will try to develop products that are similar to ours and that may infringe our intellectual property rights. Our competitors or other third-parties may also claim that our security platform and other solutions infringe their intellectual property rights. In particular, some companies in our industry have extensive patent portfolios. From time to time, third parties have in the past and may in the future assert claims of infringement, misappropriation and other violations of intellectual property rights against us or our customers, with whom our agreements may obligate us to indemnify against these claims. Successful claims of infringement by a third party could prevent us from offering certain products or features, require us to develop alternate, non-infringing technology, which could require significant time and during which we could be unable to continue to offer our affected products or solutions, require us to obtain a license, which may not be available on reasonable terms or at all, or force us to pay substantial damages, royalties, or other fees. For additional information, see the section titled “Risk Factors-Risks Related to Our Business-The success of our business depends in part on our ability to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights.”
Backlog
We enter into both single and multi-year subscription contracts for our solutions. We generally invoice the entire amount at contract signing prior to commencement of subscription period. Until such time as these amounts are invoiced, they are not recorded in deferred revenue or elsewhere in our consolidated financial statements, and are considered by us to be backlog. As of January 31, 2021, we had backlog of approximately $448.2 million. Of this amount, approximately $164.4 million is not reasonably expected to be billed in fiscal 2021. We expect backlog will change from period to period for several reasons, including the timing and duration of customer agreements, varying billing cycles of subscription agreements, and the timing and duration of customer renewals. Because revenue for any period is a function of revenue recognized from deferred revenue under contracts in existence at the beginning of the period, as well as contract renewals and new customer contracts during the period, backlog at the beginning of any period is not necessarily indicative of future revenue performance. We do not utilize backlog as a key management metric internally.
Seasonality
Given the annual budget approval process of many of our customers, we see seasonal patterns in our business. We expect these seasonal variations to become more pronounced in future periods, with net new ARR generation being greater in the second half of the year, particularly in the fourth quarter, as compared to the first half of the year. In addition, we also experience seasonality in our operating margin, with a lower margin in the first half of our fiscal year due to a step up in costs for payroll taxes, new hires, and annual sales and marketing events. This also impacts the timing of operating cash flow and free cash flow.
Human Capital Resources
As of January 31, 2021, we had 3,394 full-time employees. We also engage temporary employees and consultants as needed to support our operations. None of our employees in the United States are represented by a labor union or subject to a collective bargaining agreement. In certain countries in which we operate, we are subject to local labor law requirements which may automatically make our employees subject to industry-wide collective bargaining agreements. We have not experienced any work stoppages, and we consider our relations with our employees to be good.
Attraction, Retention, and Talent Development
Supporting our people is a foundational value for CrowdStrike. We believe the company’s success depends on our ability to attract, develop and retain key personnel. The skills, experience and industry knowledge of key employees significantly benefit our operations and performance.
Our talent sourcing is aligned to our organizational strategy to provide the expertise and skills needed to move our mission forward. We have created a high performance talent model that pinpoints the top traits and qualities we look for in talent and that may already exist within the organization, then consistently use that model to develop interview questions, screen candidates, and make hiring decisions.
We continue to market to and recruit technical talent in diverse communities by engaging as a high-level sponsor or partner of professional conferences and organizations such as Grace Hopper, Society of Women Engineers, Blavity Afrotech World, Hire Military, Black Girls Code, Thurgood Marshall College Foundation, and others.
To attract high performers, we have a team dedicated to building and promoting our employer brand focused on creating a strong employer value proposition:
•Competitive pay and benefits
•Flexible working arrangements
•Role and task diversity
•Professional development opportunities
•Organizational reputation and culture
We provide robust compensation and benefits programs to help meet the needs of our employees. In addition to base salary, these programs (which vary by country/region) include annual bonuses, equity awards, an employee stock purchase plan, a 401(k) plan, healthcare and insurance benefits, health savings and flexible spending accounts, paid time off, family leave, family care resources, flexible work schedules, adoption and surrogacy assistance, employee assistance programs, tuition assistance and on-site services such as health and fitness centers.
We invest resources to develop the talent needed to remain a leader in cybersecurity. We deliver numerous training opportunities, provide rotational assignment opportunities, have expanded our focus on continuous learning and development, and implemented new methodologies to manage performance, provide feedback, and develop talent.
Remote-First Distributed Workforce
For CrowdStrike, the ability to work remotely is a deliberate strategy that we believe fuels rapid innovation and attracts the best and brightest around the world. Our culture is purpose-built around a remote-first way of working, creating a competitive advantage for both the company and its customers and minimizing disruption from localized issues such as natural disasters, political events, or health emergencies like COVID-19.
CrowdStrike has had a distributed workforce since its inception. Before COVID-19, 70% of our workforce, including nearly all engineering and technology teams, worked on a remote basis. 100% of our workforce is remote in response to COVID-19 and we do not have immediate plans to return to physical offices.
Since the Company’s inception, we recognized that creating high-functioning, effective remote-first teams would require careful planning and system design to not only establish the culture but help it grow and evolve organically. We have designed our processes, systems, and teams so that people can perform their jobs without needing to be physically present in the same room or even in the same time zone. Part of supporting our remote-first culture also involves actively encouraging personal well-being through initiatives, including wellness programs, engagement programs (speaker series, employee resource groups, gift exchanges, mentorship opportunities, virtual events, etc.), community outreach activities, recognition programs, and groups to connect people, no matter where they are geographically, with similar interests, life circumstances or backgrounds.
Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion
A diverse, equitable, and inclusive culture fuels creative excellence and innovation, helping people achieve their best work. We continue to strive to advance our efforts to build an equitable workplace and formally establish it as part of CrowdStrike's mission and organization.
We strive to create an environment where everyone feels seen, heard, and empowered to succeed. Through employee resource groups, internal development programs, allyship training, speaker series, and networking opportunities, we are empowered to come together to create a workplace that reflects the diverse communities around us.
Setting a diverse workforce up for success requires a commitment to the practices of inclusion in everything we do. What a practice of inclusion means to us is that we are creating an environment and providing tools that help our people understand how to actively involve every employee’s ideas, knowledge, perspectives, approaches, and styles and how to engage all of our people via a mindful approach to organizational design and experiences that feels accessible and relevant to everyone.
Employee Resource Groups
Employee Resource Groups are an integral component of our commitment to foster community, promote a sense of belonging, facilitate organizational change, and drive a greater understanding of the diversity of perspectives we have across CrowdStrike. In addition to the Embracing Equity majority ally group, we have five official Employee Resource Groups and we are anticipate additional groups in the future:
•Women of CrowdStrike
•Veterans of CrowdStrike
•Pride Team (LGBTQ)
•Green Team (Sustainability)
•Team BELIEVE (Black employees)
Our Employee Resource Groups are employee led, self-directed, voluntary groups that align with our organizational mission, values, and goals that offer opportunities for groups to network, recommend business initiatives and process improvements, increase organizational awareness and allyship, and create opportunities for talent development. Employees who join an Employee Resource Group can:
•Network and build community with people with similar interests, life circumstances or backgrounds.
•Serve as champions for inclusion and belonging at CrowdStrike and help identify opportunities for us to become more inclusive.
•Identify initiatives and best practices throughout the organization and make recommendations to the business to help spark and facilitate change.

Risks Related to Our Business and Industry
We have experienced rapid growth in recent periods, and if we do not manage our future growth, our business and results of operations will be adversely affected.
We have experienced rapid revenue growth in recent periods and we expect to continue to invest broadly across our organization to support our growth. For example, our headcount grew from 324 employees as of January 31, 2016 to 3,394 employees as of January 31, 2021. Although we have experienced rapid growth historically, we may not sustain our current growth rates, nor can we assure you that our investments to support our growth will be successful. The growth and expansion of our business will require us to invest significant financial and operational resources and the continuous dedication of our management team. We have encountered and will continue to encounter risks and difficulties frequently experienced by rapidly growing companies in evolving industries, including market acceptance of our Falcon platform, adding new customers, intense competition, and our ability to manage our costs and operating expenses. Our future success will depend in part on our ability to manage our growth effectively, which will require us to, among other things:
•effectively attract, integrate, and retain a large number of new employees, particularly members of our sales and marketing and research and development teams;
•further improve our Falcon platform, including our cloud modules, and IT infrastructure, including expanding and optimizing our data centers, to support our business needs;
•enhance our information and communication systems to ensure that our employees and offices around the world are well coordinated and can effectively communicate with each other and our growing base of channel partners and customers; and
•improve our financial, management, and compliance systems and controls.
If we fail to achieve these objectives effectively, our ability to manage our expected growth, ensure uninterrupted operation of our Falcon platform and key business systems, and comply with the rules and regulations applicable to our business could be impaired. Additionally, the quality of our platform and services could suffer and we may not be able to adequately address competitive challenges. Any of the foregoing could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
We have a history of losses and may not be able to achieve or sustain profitability in the future.
We have incurred net losses in all periods since our inception, and we may not achieve or maintain profitability in the future. We experienced net losses of $140.1 million, $141.8 million, and $92.6 million for fiscal 2019, fiscal 2020, and fiscal 2021, respectively. As of January 31, 2021, we had an accumulated deficit of $730.1 million. While we have experienced significant growth in revenue in recent periods, we cannot assure you when or whether we will reach or maintain profitability. We also expect our operating expenses to increase in the future as we continue to invest for our future growth, which will negatively affect our results of operations if our total revenue does not increase. We cannot assure you that these investments will result in substantial increases in our total revenue or improvements in our results of operations. In addition to the anticipated costs to grow our business, we have incurred and expect to continue to incur significant additional legal, accounting, and other expenses as a newly public company. Any failure to increase our revenue as we invest in our business or to manage our costs could prevent us from achieving or maintaining profitability or positive cash flow.
Our limited operating history makes it difficult to evaluate our current business and future prospects, and may increase the risk of your investment.
We were founded in November 2011 and launched our first endpoint security solution in 2013. Our limited operating history makes it difficult to evaluate our current business, future prospects, and other trends, including our ability to plan for and model future growth. We have encountered and will continue to encounter risks, uncertainties, and difficulties frequently experienced by rapidly growing companies in evolving industries, including our ability to achieve broad market acceptance of cloud-based, SaaS-delivered endpoint security solutions and our Falcon platform, attract additional customers, grow partnerships, compete effectively, build and maintain effective compliance programs, and manage increasing expenses as we continue to invest in our business. If we do not address these risks, uncertainties, and difficulties successfully, our business, and results of operations will be harmed. Further, we have limited historical financial data, and we operate in a rapidly evolving market. As a result, any predictions about our future revenue and expenses may not be as accurate as they would be if we had a longer operating history or operated in a more predictable market.
The COVID-19 pandemic could adversely affect our business, operating results and future revenue.
In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a global pandemic. This contagious disease outbreak has spread across the globe and is impacting worldwide economic activity and financial markets. In light of the uncertain and rapidly evolving situation relating to the spread of COVID-19, we have taken precautionary measures intended to mitigate the spread of the virus and minimize the risk to our employees, customers, partners, and the communities in which we operate. These measures include transitioning our employee population to work remotely from home until at least April 30, 2021, imposing travel restrictions for our employees, shifting customer, partner and investor events to virtual-only formats, and limiting capacity at any of our offices which have reopened or may reopen during the pandemic’s duration. These precautionary measures could negatively affect our customer success efforts, delay and lengthen our sales cycles, impact our sales and marketing efforts, reduce employee efficiency and productivity, slow our international expansion efforts, increase cybersecurity risks, and create operational or other challenges, any of which could harm our business and results of operations. Moreover, due to our subscription-based business model, the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic may not be fully reflected in our results of operations until future periods, if at all.
In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic may disrupt the operations of our customers and partners for an indefinite period of time. Some of our customers have been negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic which could result in delays in accounts receivable collection, or result in decreased technology spending which could negatively affect our revenues.
More generally, the COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected economies and financial markets globally, and continued uncertainty could lead to a prolonged economic downturn, which could result in a larger customer churn than we currently anticipate and reduced demand for our products and services, in which case our revenues could be significantly impacted. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic may also exacerbate other risks discussed in this “Risk Factors” section and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. It is not possible at this time to estimate the impact that the COVID-19 pandemic could have on our business, as the impact will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted.
If organizations do not adopt cloud-based SaaS-delivered endpoint security solutions, our ability to grow our business and results of operations may be adversely affected.
We believe our future success will depend in large part on the growth, if any, in the market for cloud-based SaaS-delivered endpoint security solutions. The use of SaaS solutions to manage and automate security and IT operations is at an early stage and rapidly evolving. As such, it is difficult to predict its potential growth, if any, customer adoption and retention rates, customer demand for our solutions, or the success of existing competitive products. Any expansion in our market depends on a number of factors, including the cost, performance, and perceived value associated with our solutions and those of our competitors. If our solutions do not achieve widespread adoption or there is a reduction in demand for our solutions due to a lack of customer acceptance, technological challenges, competing products, privacy concerns, decreases in corporate spending, weakening economic conditions or otherwise, it could result in early terminations, reduced customer retention rates, or decreased revenue, any of which would adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial results. We do not know whether the trend in adoption of cloud-based SaaS-delivered endpoint security solutions we have experienced in the past will continue in the future. Furthermore, if we or other SaaS security providers experience security incidents, loss or disclosure of customer data, disruptions in delivery, or other problems, the market for SaaS solutions as a whole, including our security solutions, could be negatively affected. You should consider our business and prospects in light of the risks and difficulties we encounter in this new and evolving market.
If we are unable to attract new customers, our future results of operations could be harmed.
To expand our customer base, we need to convince potential customers to allocate a portion of their discretionary budgets to purchase our Falcon platform. Our sales efforts often involve educating our prospective customers about the uses and benefits of our Falcon platform. Enterprises and governments that use legacy security products, such as signature-based or malware-based products, firewalls, intrusion prevention systems, and antivirus, for their IT security may be hesitant to purchase our Falcon platform if they believe that these products are more cost effective, provide substantially the same functionality as our Falcon platform or provide a level of IT security that is sufficient to meet their needs. We may have difficulty convincing prospective customers of the value of adopting our solution. Even if we are successful in convincing prospective customers that a cloud native platform like ours is critical to protect against cyberattacks, they may not decide to purchase our Falcon platform for a variety of reasons, some of which are out of our control. For example, any deterioration in general economic conditions, including a downturn due to the outbreak of diseases such as COVID-19, may cause our current and prospective customers to
cut their overall security and IT operations spending, and such cuts may fall disproportionately on cloud-based security solutions like ours. Economic weakness, customer financial difficulties, and constrained spending on security and IT operations may result in decreased revenue, reduced sales, lengthened sales cycles, increased churn, lower demand for our products, and adversely affect our results of operations and financial conditions. Additionally, if the incidence of cyberattacks were to decline, or be perceived to decline, or if organizations adopt endpoints that use operating systems we do not adequately support, our ability to attract new customers and expand sales of our solutions to existing customers could be adversely affected. If organizations do not continue to adopt our Falcon platform, our sales will not grow as quickly as anticipated, or at all, and our business, results of operations, and financial condition would be harmed.
If our customers do not renew their subscriptions for our products and add additional cloud modules to their subscriptions, our future results of operations could be harmed.
In order for us to maintain or improve our results of operations, it is important that our customers renew their subscriptions for our Falcon platform when existing contract terms expire, and that we expand our commercial relationships with our existing customers by selling additional cloud modules and by deploying to more endpoints in their environments. Our customers have no obligation to renew their subscription for our Falcon platform after the expiration of their contractual subscription period, which is generally one year, and in the normal course of business, some customers have elected not to renew. In addition, our customers may renew for shorter contract subscription lengths or cease using certain cloud modules. Our customer retention and expansion may decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including our customers’ satisfaction with our services, our pricing, customer security and networking issues and requirements, our customers’ spending levels, decreases in the number of endpoints to which our customers deploy our solutions, mergers and acquisitions involving our customers, industry developments, competition and general economic conditions. If our efforts to maintain and expand our relationships with our existing customers are not successful, our business, results of operations, and financial condition may materially suffer.
We face intense competition and could lose market share to our competitors, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
The market for security and IT operations solutions is intensely competitive, fragmented, and characterized by rapid changes in technology, customer requirements, industry standards, increasingly sophisticated attackers, and by frequent introductions of new or improved products to combat security threats. We expect to continue to face intense competition from current competitors, as well as from new entrants into the market. If we are unable to anticipate or react to these challenges, our competitive position could weaken, and we could experience a decline in revenue or reduced revenue growth, and loss of market share that would adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Our ability to compete effectively depends upon numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control, including, but not limited to:
•product capabilities, including performance and reliability, of our Falcon platform, including our cloud modules, services, and features compared to those of our competitors;
•our ability, and the ability of our competitors, to improve existing products, services, and features, or to develop new ones to address evolving customer needs;
•our ability to attract, retain, and motivate talented employees;
•our ability to establish and maintain relationships with channel partners;
•the strength of our sales and marketing efforts; and
•acquisitions or consolidation within our industry, which may result in more formidable competitors.
Our competitors include the following by general category:
•legacy antivirus product providers, such as McAfee, LLC, Broadcom Inc.’s Symantec Enterprise division, and Microsoft Corporation, who offer a broad range of approaches and solutions including traditional antivirus and signature-based protection;
•alternative endpoint security providers, such as Blackberry Cylance, VMware Carbon Black and SentinelOne, who offer point products based on malware-only or application whitelisting techniques; and
•network security vendors, such as Palo Alto Networks, Inc. and FireEye, Inc., who are supplementing their core perimeter-based offerings with endpoint security solutions.
Many of these competitors have greater financial, technical, marketing, sales, and other resources, greater name recognition, longer operating histories, and a larger base of customers than we do. They may be able to devote greater resources to the development, promotion, and sale of services than we can, and they may offer lower pricing than we do. Further, they may have greater resources for research and development of new technologies, the provision of customer support, and the pursuit of acquisitions, or they may have other financial, technical, or other resource advantages. Our larger competitors have substantially broader and more diverse product and services offerings as well as routes to market, which allows them to leverage their relationships based on other products or incorporate functionality into existing products to gain business in a manner that discourages users from purchasing our platform, including our cloud modules. Conditions in our market could change rapidly and significantly as a result of technological advancements, partnering or acquisitions by our competitors or continuing market consolidation. Some of our competitors have recently made acquisitions of businesses or have established cooperative relationships that may allow them to offer more directly competitive and comprehensive solutions than were previously offered and adapt more quickly to new technologies and customer needs. These competitive pressures in our market or our failure to compete effectively may result in price reductions, fewer orders, reduced revenue and gross margins, increased net losses and loss of market share. Further, many competitors that specialize in providing protection from a single type of security threat may be able to deliver these targeted security products to the market quicker than we can or convince organizations that these limited products meet their needs. Even if there is significant demand for cloud-based security solutions like ours, if our competitors include functionality that is, or is perceived to be, equivalent to or better than ours in legacy products that are already generally accepted as necessary components of an organization’s IT security architecture, we may have difficulty increasing the market penetration of our platform. Furthermore, even if the functionality offered by other security and IT operations providers is different and more limited than the functionality of our platform, organizations may elect to accept such limited functionality in lieu of adding products from additional vendors like us. If we are unable to compete successfully, or if competing successfully requires us to take aggressive pricing or other actions, our business, financial condition, and results of operations would be adversely affected.
Competitive pricing pressure may reduce our gross profits and adversely affect our financial results.
If we are unable to maintain our pricing due to competitive pressures or other factors, our margins will be reduced and our gross profits, business, results of operations, and financial condition would be adversely affected. The subscription prices for our Falcon platform, cloud modules, and professional services may decline for a variety of reasons, including competitive pricing pressures, discounts, anticipation of the introduction of new solutions by our competitors, or promotional programs offered by us or our competitors. Competition continues to increase in the market segments in which we operate, and we expect competition to further increase in the future. Larger competitors with more diverse product and service offerings may reduce the price of products or subscriptions that compete with ours or may bundle them with other products and subscriptions.
If our solutions fail or are perceived to fail to detect or prevent incidents or have or are perceived to have defects, errors, or vulnerabilities, our brand and reputation would be harmed, which would adversely affect our business and results of operations.
Real or perceived defects, errors or vulnerabilities in our Falcon platform and cloud modules, the failure of our platform to detect or prevent incidents, including advanced and newly developed attacks, misconfiguration of our solutions, or the failure of customers to take action on attacks identified by our platform could harm our reputation and adversely affect our business, financial position and results of operations. Because our cloud native security platform is complex, it may contain defects or errors that are not detected until after deployment. We cannot assure you that our products will detect all cyberattacks, especially in light of the rapidly changing security threat landscape that our solution seeks to address. Due to a variety of both internal and external factors, including, without limitation, defects or misconfigurations of our solutions, our solutions could become vulnerable to security incidents (both from intentional attacks and accidental causes) that cause them to fail to secure endpoints and detect and block attacks. In addition, because the techniques used by computer hackers to access or sabotage networks and endpoints change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, there is a risk that an advanced attack could emerge that our cloud native security platform is unable to detect or prevent until after some of our customers are affected. Additionally, our Falcon platform may falsely indicate a cyberattack or threat that does not actually exist, which may lessen customers’ trust in our solutions.
Moreover, as our cloud native security platform is adopted by an increasing number of enterprises and governments, it is possible that the individuals and organizations behind advanced cyberattacks will begin to focus on finding ways to defeat our security platform. If this happens, our systems and subscription customers could be specifically targeted by attackers and could result in vulnerabilities in our platform or undermine the market acceptance of our Falcon platform and could adversely affect our reputation as a provider of security solutions. Because we host customer data on our cloud platform, which in some cases may contain personally-identifiable information or potentially confidential information, a security compromise, or an accidental or intentional misconfiguration or malfunction of our platform could result in personally-identifiable information and other customer data being accessible such as to attackers or to other customers. Further, if a high profile security breach occurs with respect to another next-generation or cloud-based security system, our customers and potential customers may lose trust in cloud solutions generally, and cloud-based security solutions such as ours in particular.
Organizations are increasingly subject to a wide variety of attacks on their networks, systems, and endpoints. No security solution, including our Falcon platform, can address all possible security threats or block all methods of penetrating a network or otherwise perpetrating a security incident. If any of our customers experiences a successful cyberattack while using our solutions or services, such customer could be disappointed with our Falcon platform, regardless of whether our solutions or services blocked the theft of any of such customer’s data, or if the attack would have otherwise been mitigated or prevented if the customer had fully deployed aspects of our Falcon platform. Similarly, if our solutions detect attacks against a customer but the customer does not address the vulnerability, customers and the public may erroneously believe that our solutions were not effective. Security breaches against customers that use our solutions may result in customers and the public believing that our solutions failed. Our Falcon platform may fail to detect or prevent malware, viruses, worms or similar threats for any number of reasons, including our failure to enhance and expand our Falcon platform to reflect the increasing sophistication of malware, viruses and other threats. Real or perceived security breaches of our customers’ networks could cause disruption or damage to their networks or other negative consequences and could result in negative publicity to us, damage to our reputation, and other customer relations issues, and may adversely affect our revenue and results of operations.
As a cybersecurity provider, we have been, and expect to continue to be, a target of cyberattacks. If our internal networks, systems, or data are or are perceived to have been compromised, our reputation may be damaged and our financial results may be negatively affected.
As a provider of security solutions, we have in the past been, and may in the future be, specifically targeted by bad actors for attacks intended to circumvent our security capabilities or to exploit our Falcon platform as an entry point into customers’ endpoints, networks, or systems. In particular, because we have been involved in the identification of organized cybercriminals and nation-state actors, we have been the subject of intense efforts by sophisticated cyber adversaries who seek to compromise our systems. We are also susceptible to inadvertent compromises of our systems and data, including those arising from process, coding, or human errors. A successful attack or other incident that compromises our or our customers’ data or results in an interruption of service could have a significant negative effect on our operations, reputation, financial resources, and the value of our intellectual property. We cannot assure you that any of our efforts to manage this risk, including adoption of a comprehensive incident response plan and process for detecting, mitigating, and investigating security incidents that we regularly test through table-top exercises, testing of our security protocols through additional techniques, such as penetration testing, debriefing after security incidents, to improve our security and responses, and regular briefing of our directors and officers on our cybersecurity risks, preparedness, and management, will be effective in protecting us from such attacks.
It is virtually impossible for us to entirely eliminate the risk of such compromises, interruptions in service, or other security incidents affecting our internal systems or data, or that of our third-party service providers and vendors. Organizations are subject to a wide variety of attacks on their supply chain, networks, systems, and endpoints, and techniques used to sabotage or to obtain unauthorized access to networks in which data is stored or through which data is transmitted change frequently. Furthermore, employee error or malicious activity could compromise our systems. As a result, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate measures to prevent an intrusion into our networks, which could result in unauthorized access to customer data, intellectual property including access to our source code, and information about vulnerabilities in our product, which in turn, could reduce the effectiveness of our solutions, or lead to cyberattacks or other intrusions of our customers’ networks, litigation, governmental audits and investigations and significant legal fees, and or all of which could damage our relationships with our existing customers and could have a negative effect on our ability to attract and retain new customers. We have expended, and anticipate continuing to expend, significant amounts and resources in an effort to prevent security breaches and other security incidents impacting our systems and data. Since our business is focused on providing reliable security services to our customers, we believe that an actual or perceived security incident affecting, our internal
systems or data or data of our customers would be especially detrimental to our reputation, customer confidence in our solution, and our business.
In addition, while we maintain insurance policies that may cover certain liabilities in connection with a cybersecurity incident, we cannot be certain that our insurance coverage will be adequate for liabilities actually incurred, that insurance will continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, or that any insurer will not deny coverage as to any future claim. The successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceed available insurance coverage, or the occurrence of changes in our insurance policies, including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or co-insurance requirements, could have a material adverse effect on our business, including our financial condition, results of operations and reputation.
We rely on third-party data centers, such as Amazon Web Services, and our own colocation data centers to host and operate our Falcon platform, and any disruption of or interference with our use of these facilities may negatively affect our ability to maintain the performance and reliability of our Falcon platform which could cause our business to suffer.
Our customers depend on the continuous availability of our Falcon platform. We currently host our Falcon platform and serve our customers using a mix of third-party data centers, primarily Amazon Web Services, Inc., or AWS, and our data centers, hosted in colocation facilities. Consequently, we may be subject to service disruptions as well as failures to provide adequate support for reasons that are outside of our direct control. We have experienced, and expect that in the future we may experience interruptions, delays and outages in service and availability from time to time due to a variety of factors, including infrastructure changes, human or software errors, website hosting disruptions and capacity constraints.
The following factors, many of which are beyond our control, can affect the delivery, availability, and the performance of our Falcon platform:
•the development and maintenance of the infrastructure of the internet;
•the performance and availability of third-party providers of cloud infrastructure services, such as AWS, with the necessary speed, data capacity and security for providing reliable internet access and services;
•decisions by the owners and operators of the data centers where our cloud infrastructure is deployed to terminate our contracts, discontinue services to us, shut down operations or facilities, increase prices, change service levels, limit bandwidth, declare bankruptcy or prioritize the traffic of other parties;
•physical or electronic break-ins, acts of war or terrorism, human error or interference (including by disgruntled employees, former employees or contractors) and other catastrophic events;
•cyberattacks, including denial of service attacks, targeted at us, our data centers, or the infrastructure of the internet;
•failure by us to maintain and update our cloud infrastructure to meet our data capacity requirements;
•errors, defects or performance problems in our software, including third-party software incorporated in our software;
•improper deployment or configuration of our solutions;
•the failure of our redundancy systems, in the event of a service disruption at one of our data centers, to provide failover to other data centers in our data center network; and
•the failure of our disaster recovery and business continuity arrangements.
The adverse effects of any service interruptions on our reputation, results of operations, and financial condition may be disproportionately heightened due to the nature of our business and the fact that our customers have a low tolerance for interruptions of any duration. Interruptions or failures in our service delivery could result in a cyberattack or other security threat to one of our customers during such periods of interruption or failure. Additionally, interruptions or failures in our service could cause customers to terminate their subscriptions with us, adversely affect our renewal rates, and harm our ability to attract new customers. Our business would also be harmed if our customers believe that a cloud-based SaaS-delivered endpoint
security solution is unreliable. While we do not consider them to have been material, we have experienced, and may in the future experience, service interruptions and other performance problems due to a variety of factors. The occurrence of any of these factors, or if we are unable to rapidly and cost-effectively fix such errors or other problems that may be identified, could damage our reputation, negatively affect our relationship with our customers or otherwise harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.
If we do not effectively expand and train our direct sales force, we may be unable to add new customers or increase sales to our existing customers, and our business will be adversely affected.
We depend on our direct sales force to obtain new customers and increase sales with existing customers. Our ability to achieve significant revenue growth will depend, in large part, on our success in recruiting, training and retaining sufficient numbers of sales personnel, particularly in international markets. We have expanded our sales organization significantly in recent periods and expect to continue to add additional sales capabilities in the near term. There is significant competition for sales personnel with the skills and technical knowledge that we require. New hires require significant training and may take significant time before they achieve full productivity, and this delay is accentuated by our long sales cycles. Our recent hires and planned hires may not become productive as quickly as we expect, and we may be unable to hire or retain sufficient numbers of qualified individuals in the markets where we do business or plan to do business. In addition, a large percentage of our sales force is new to our company and selling our solutions, and therefore this team may be less effective than our more seasoned sales personnel. Furthermore, hiring sales personnel in new countries, or expanding our existing presence, requires upfront and ongoing expenditures that we may not recover if the sales personnel fail to achieve full productivity. We cannot predict whether, or to what extent, our sales will increase as we expand our sales force or how long it will take for sales personnel to become productive. If we are unable to hire and train a sufficient number of effective sales personnel, or the sales personnel we hire are not successful in obtaining new customers or increasing sales to our existing customer base, our business and results of operations will be adversely affected.
Because we recognize revenue from subscriptions to our platform over the term of the subscription, downturns or upturns in new business will not be immediately reflected in our results of operations.
We generally recognize revenue from customers ratably over the terms of their subscription, which is generally one year. As a result, a substantial portion of the revenue we report in each period is attributable to the recognition of deferred revenue relating to agreements that we entered into during previous periods. Consequently, any increase or decline in new sales or renewals in any one period will not be immediately reflected in our revenue for that period. Any such change, however, would affect our revenue in future periods. Accordingly, the effect of downturns or upturns in new sales and potential changes in our rate of renewals may not be fully reflected in our results of operations until future periods. We may also be unable to timely reduce our cost structure in line with a significant deterioration in sales or renewals that would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
Our results of operations may fluctuate significantly, which could make our future results difficult to predict and could cause our results of operations to fall below expectations.
Our results of operations may vary significantly from period to period, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our results of operations have varied significantly from period to period, and we expect that our results of operations will continue to vary as a result of a number of factors, many of which are outside of our control and may be difficult to predict, including:
•the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations, financial results, and liquidity and capital resources, including on customers, sales, expenses, and employees;
•our ability to attract new and retain existing customers;
•the budgeting cycles, seasonal buying patterns, and purchasing practices of customers;
•the timing and length of our sales cycles;
•changes in customer or channel partner requirements or market needs;
•changes in the growth rate of the cloud-based SaaS-delivered endpoint security solutions market;
•the timing and success of new product and service introductions by us or our competitors or any other competitive developments, including consolidation among our customers or competitors;
•the level of awareness of cybersecurity threats, particularly advanced cyberattacks, and the market adoption of our Falcon platform;
•our ability to successfully expand our business domestically and internationally;
•decisions by organizations to purchase security solutions from larger, more established security vendors or from their primary IT equipment vendors;
•changes in our pricing policies or those of our competitors;
•any disruption in our relationship with channel partners;
•insolvency or credit difficulties confronting our customers, affecting their ability to purchase or pay for our solutions;
•significant security breaches of, technical difficulties with or interruptions to, the use of our Falcon platform;
•extraordinary expenses such as litigation or other dispute-related settlement payments or outcomes;
•general economic conditions, both domestic and in our foreign markets;
•future accounting pronouncements or changes in our accounting policies or practices;
•negative media coverage or publicity;
•political events;
•the amount and timing of operating costs and capital expenditures related to the expansion of our business; and
•increases or decreases in our expenses caused by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.
In addition, we experience seasonal fluctuations in our financial results as we typically receive a higher percentage of our annual orders from new customers, as well as renewal orders from existing customers, in the second half of the fiscal year as compared to the first half of the year due to the annual budget approval process of many of our customers. In addition, we also experience seasonality in our operating margin, with a lower margin in the first half of our fiscal year. Any of the above factors, individually or in the aggregate, may result in significant fluctuations in our financial and other results of operations from period to period. As a result of this variability, our historical results of operations should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance. Moreover, this variability and unpredictability could result in our failure to meet our operating plan or the expectations of investors or analysts for any period. If we fail to meet such expectations for these or other reasons, our stock price could fall substantially, and we could face costly lawsuits, including securities class action suits.
Our sales cycles can be long and unpredictable, and our sales efforts require considerable time and expense.
Our revenue recognition is difficult to predict because of the length and unpredictability of the sales cycle for our Falcon platform, particularly with respect to large organizations and government entities. Customers often view the subscription to our Falcon platform as a significant strategic decision and, as a result, frequently require considerable time to evaluate, test and qualify our Falcon platform prior to entering into or expanding a relationship with us. Large enterprises and government entities in particular often undertake a significant evaluation process that further lengthens our sales cycle.
Our direct sales team develops relationships with our customers, and works with our channel partners on account penetration, account coordination, sales and overall market development. We spend substantial time and resources on our sales efforts without any assurance that our efforts will produce a sale. Security solution purchases are frequently subject to budget constraints, multiple approvals and unanticipated administrative, processing and other delays. As a result, it is difficult to predict whether and when a sale will be completed. The failure of our efforts to secure sales after investing resources in a lengthy sales process could adversely affect our business and results of operations.
We rely on our key technical, sales and management personnel to grow our business, and the loss of one or more key employees could harm our business.
Our future success is substantially dependent on our ability to attract, retain, and motivate the members of our management team and other key employees throughout our organization. In particular, we are highly dependent on the services of George Kurtz, our President and Chief Executive Officer, who is critical to our future vision and strategic direction. We rely on our leadership team in the areas of operations, security, research and development, marketing, sales, support and general and administrative functions. Although we have entered into employment agreements with our key personnel, our employees, including our executive officers, work for us on an “at-will” basis, which means they may terminate their employment with us at any time. If Mr. Kurtz, or one or more of our key employees, or members of our management team resigns or otherwise ceases to provide us with their service, our business could be harmed.
If we are unable to attract and retain qualified personnel, our business could be harmed.
There is also significant competition for personnel with the skills and technical knowledge that we require across our technology, cyber, sales, professional services, and administrative support functions. Competition for these personnel in the San Francisco Bay Area, where our headquarters are located, and in other locations where we maintain offices, is intense, especially for experienced sales professionals and for engineers experienced in designing and developing cloud applications and security software. We have from time to time experienced, and we expect to continue to experience, difficulty in hiring and retaining employees with appropriate qualifications. For example, in recent years, recruiting, hiring and retaining employees with expertise in the cybersecurity industry has become increasingly difficult as the demand for cybersecurity professionals has increased as a result of the recent cybersecurity attacks on global corporations and governments. Additionally, our incident response and proactive services team is small and comprised of personnel with highly technical skills and experience, who are in high demand, and who would be difficult to replace. Many of the companies with which we compete for experienced personnel have greater resources than we have. Our competitors also may be successful in recruiting and hiring members of our management team or other key employees, and it may be difficult for us to find suitable replacements on a timely basis, on competitive terms, or at all. We have in the past, and may in the future, be subject to allegations that employees we hire have been improperly solicited, or that they have divulged proprietary or other confidential information or that their former employers own such employees’ inventions or other work product, or that they have been hired in violation of non-compete provisions or non-solicitation provisions.
In addition, job candidates and existing employees often consider the value of the equity awards they receive in connection with their employment. Volatility or lack of performance in our stock price may also affect our ability to attract and retain our key employees. Also, many of our employees have become, or will soon become, vested in a substantial amount of equity awards, which may give them a substantial amount of personal wealth. This may make it more difficult for us to retain and motivate these employees, and this wealth could affect their decision about whether or not they continue to work for us. Any failure to successfully attract, integrate or retain qualified personnel to fulfill our current or future needs could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
If we are not able to maintain and enhance our CrowdStrike and Falcon brand and our reputation as a provider of high-efficacy security solutions, our business and results of operations may be adversely affected.
We believe that maintaining and enhancing our CrowdStrike and Falcon brand and our reputation as a provider of high-efficacy security solutions is critical to our relationship with our existing customers, channel partners, and technology alliance partners and our ability to attract new customers and partners. The successful promotion of our CrowdStrike and Falcon brand will depend on a number of factors, including our marketing efforts, our ability to continue to develop additional cloud modules and features for our Falcon platform, our ability to successfully differentiate our Falcon platform from competitive cloud-based or legacy security solutions and, ultimately, our ability to detect and stop breaches. Although we believe it is important for our growth, our brand promotion activities may not be successful or yield increased revenue.
In addition, independent industry or financial analysts and research firms often test our solutions and provide reviews of our Falcon platform, as well as the products of our competitors, and perception of our Falcon platform in the marketplace may be significantly influenced by these reviews. If these reviews are negative, or less positive as compared to those of our competitors’ products, our brand may be adversely affected. Our solutions may fail to detect or prevent threats in any particular test for a number of reasons that may or may not be related to the efficacy of our solutions in real world environments. To the extent potential customers, industry analysts or testing firms believe that the occurrence of a failure to detect or prevent any
particular threat is a flaw or indicates that our solutions or services do not provide significant value, we may lose customers, and our reputation, financial condition and business would be harmed. Additionally, the performance of our channel partners and technology alliance partners may affect our brand and reputation if customers do not have a positive experience with these partners. In addition, we have in the past worked, and continue to work, with high profile customers as well as assist in analyzing and remediating high profile cyberattacks. Our work with such customers has exposed us to publicity and media coverage. Negative publicity about us, including about our management, the efficacy and reliability of our Falcon platform, our products offerings, our professional services, and the customers we work with, even if inaccurate, could adversely affect our reputation and brand.
If we are unable to maintain successful relationships with our channel partners and technology alliance partners, or if our channel partners or technology alliance partners fail to perform, our ability to market, sell and distribute our Falcon platform will be limited, and our business, financial position and results of operations will be harmed.
In addition to our direct sales force, we rely on our channel partners to sell and support our Falcon platform. A vast majority of sales of our Falcon platform flow through our channel partners, and we expect this to continue for the foreseeable future. Additionally, we have entered, and intend to continue to enter, into technology alliance partnerships with third parties to support our future growth plans. The loss of a substantial number of our channel partners or technology alliance partners, or the failure to recruit additional partners, could adversely affect our results of operations. Our ability to achieve revenue growth in the future will depend in part on our success in maintaining successful relationships with our channel partners and in training our channel partners to independently sell and deploy our Falcon platform. If we fail to effectively manage our existing sales channels, or if our channel partners are unsuccessful in fulfilling the orders for our solutions, or if we are unable to enter into arrangements with, and retain a sufficient number of, high quality channel partners in each of the regions in which we sell solutions and keep them motivated to sell our products, our ability to sell our products and results of operations will be harmed.
Our business depends, in part, on sales to government organizations, and significant changes in the contracting or fiscal policies of such government organizations could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
Our future growth depends, in part, on increasing sales to government organizations. Demand from government organizations is often unpredictable, subject to budgetary uncertainty and typically involves long sales cycles. We have made significant investment to address the government sector, but we cannot assure you that these investments will be successful, or that we will be able to maintain or grow our revenue from the government sector. Although we anticipate that they may increase in the future, sales to U.S. federal, state, and local governmental agencies have not accounted for, and may never account for, a significant portion of our revenue. U.S. federal, state and local government sales are subject to a number of challenges and risks that may adversely impact our business. Sales to such government entities include the following risks:
•selling to governmental agencies can be highly competitive, expensive and time consuming, often requiring significant upfront time and expense without any assurance that such efforts will generate a sale;
•government certification requirements applicable to our products may change and, in doing so, restrict our ability to sell into the U.S. federal government sector until we have attained the revised certification. For example, although we are currently certified under the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program, or FedRAMP, such certification is costly to maintain and if we lost our certification in the future it would restrict our ability to sell to government customers;
•government demand and payment for our Falcon platform may be impacted by public sector budgetary cycles and funding authorizations, with funding reductions or delays adversely affecting public sector demand for our Falcon platform;
•governments routinely investigate and audit government contractors’ administrative processes, and any unfavorable audit could result in the government refusing to continue buying our Falcon platform, which would adversely impact our revenue and results of operations, or institute fines or civil or criminal liability if the audit were to uncover improper or illegal activities; and
•governments may require certain products to be manufactured, hosted, or accessed solely in their country or in other relatively high-cost manufacturing locations, and we may not manufacture all products in locations that meet these requirements, affecting our ability to sell these products to governmental agencies.
The occurrence of any of the foregoing could cause governments and governmental agencies to delay or refrain from purchasing our solutions in the future or otherwise have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
We may not timely and cost-effectively scale and adapt our existing technology to meet our customers’ performance and other requirements.
Our future growth is dependent upon our ability to continue to meet the needs of new customers and the expanding needs of our existing customers as their use of our solutions grow. As our customers gain more experience with our solutions, the number of endpoints and events, the amount of data transferred, processed and stored by us, the number of locations where our platform and services are being accessed, have in the past, and may in the future, expand rapidly. In order to meet the performance and other requirements of our customers, we intend to continue to make significant investments to increase capacity and to develop and implement new technologies in our service and cloud infrastructure operations. These technologies, which include databases, applications and server optimizations, network and hosting strategies, and automation, are often advanced, complex, new and untested. We may not be successful in developing or implementing these technologies. In addition, it takes a significant amount of time to plan, develop and test improvements to our technologies and infrastructure, and we may not be able to accurately forecast demand or predict the results we will realize from such improvements. To the extent that we do not effectively scale our operations to meet the needs of our growing customer base and to maintain performance as our customers expand their use of our solutions, we may not be able to grow as quickly as we anticipate, our customers may reduce or cancel use of our solutions and we may be unable to compete as effectively and our business and results of operations may be harmed.
Additionally, we have and will continue to make substantial investments to support growth at our data centers and improve the profitability of our cloud platform. For example, because of the importance of AWS’ services to our business and AWS’ position in the cloud-based server industry, any renegotiation or renewal of our agreement with AWS may be on terms that are significantly less favorable to us than our current agreement. If our cloud-based server costs were to increase, our business, results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected. Although we expect that we could receive similar services from other third parties, if any of our arrangements with AWS are terminated, we could experience interruptions on our Falcon platform and in our ability to make our solutions available to customers, as well as delays and additional expenses in arranging alternative cloud infrastructure services. Ongoing improvements to cloud infrastructure may be more expensive than we anticipate, and may not yield the expected savings in operating costs or the expected performance benefits. In addition, we may be required to re-invest any cost savings achieved from prior cloud infrastructure improvements in future infrastructure projects to maintain the levels of service required by our customers. We may not be able to maintain or achieve cost savings from our investments, which could harm our financial results.
Our ability to maintain customer satisfaction depends in part on the quality of our customer support.
Once our Falcon platform is deployed within our customers’ networks, our customers depend on our customer support services to resolve any issues relating to the implementation and maintenance of our Falcon platform. If we do not provide effective ongoing support, customer renewals and our ability to sell additional modules as part of our Falcon platform to existing customers could be adversely affected and our reputation with potential customers could be damaged. Many larger organizations have more complex networks and require higher levels of support than smaller customers and we offer premium services for these customers. Failure to maintain high-quality customer support could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
We may need to raise additional capital to expand our operations and invest in new solutions, which capital may not be available on terms acceptable to us, or at all, and which could reduce our ability to compete and could harm our business.
We expect that our existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next 12 months. Retaining or expanding our current levels of personnel and products offerings may require additional funds to respond to business challenges, including the need to develop new products and enhancements to our Falcon platform, improve our operating infrastructure, or acquire complementary businesses and technologies. Our failure to raise additional capital or generate the significant capital necessary to expand our operations and invest in new products could reduce our ability to compete and could harm our business. Accordingly, we may need to engage in additional equity or debt financings to secure additional funds. If we raise additional equity financing, our stockholders may experience significant dilution of their ownership interests and the market price of our Class A common stock could decline. If we engage in additional debt financing, the holders of such debt would have priority over the holders of our Class A common
stock, and we may be required to accept terms that further restrict our operations or our ability to incur additional indebtedness or to take other actions that would otherwise be in the interests of the debt holders. Any of the above could harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
If we cannot maintain our company culture as we grow, we could lose the innovation, teamwork, passion, and focus on execution that we believe contribute to our success and our business may be harmed.
We believe that our corporate culture has been a contributor to our success, which we believe fosters innovation, teamwork, passion and focus on building and marketing our Falcon platform. As we grow, we may find it difficult to maintain our corporate culture. Any failure to preserve our culture could harm our future success, including our ability to retain and recruit personnel, innovate and operate effectively and execute on our business strategy. Additionally, our productivity and the quality of our solutions may be adversely affected if we do not integrate and train our new employees quickly and effectively. If we experience any of these effects in connection with future growth, it could impair our ability to attract new customers, retain existing customers and expand their use of our Falcon platform, all of which would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Our international operations and plans for future international expansion expose us to significant risks, and failure to manage those risks could adversely impact our business.
We derived approximately 23%, 26%, and 28% of our total revenue from our international customers for fiscal 2019, fiscal 2020, fiscal 2021, respectively. We are continuing to adapt to and develop strategies to address international markets and our growth strategy includes expansion into target geographies, but there is no guarantee that such efforts will be successful. We expect that our international activities will continue to grow in the future, as we continue to pursue opportunities in international markets. These international operations will require significant management attention and financial resources and are subject to substantial risks, including:
•greater difficulty in negotiating contracts with standard terms, enforcing contracts and managing collections, and longer collection periods;
•higher costs of doing business internationally, including costs incurred in establishing and maintaining office space and equipment for our international operations;
•management communication and integration problems resulting from cultural and geographic dispersion;
•risks associated with trade restrictions and foreign legal requirements, including any importation, certification, and localization of our Falcon platform that may be required in foreign countries;
•greater risk of unexpected changes in regulatory practices, tariffs, and tax laws and treaties;
•compliance with anti-bribery laws, including, without limitation, compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended, or FCPA the U.S. Travel Act and the UK Bribery Act 2010, or Bribery Act, violations of which could lead to significant fines, penalties, and collateral consequences for our company;
•heightened risk of unfair or corrupt business practices in certain geographies and of improper or fraudulent sales arrangements that may impact financial results and result in restatements of, or irregularities in, financial statements;
•the uncertainty of protection for intellectual property rights in some countries;
•general economic and political conditions in these foreign markets;
•foreign exchange controls or tax regulations that might prevent us from repatriating cash earned outside the United States;
•political and economic instability in some countries;
•double taxation of our international earnings and potentially adverse tax consequences due to changes in the tax laws of the United States or the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate;
•unexpected costs for the localization of our services, including translation into foreign languages and adaptation for local practices and regulatory requirements;
•requirements to comply with foreign privacy, data protection, and information security laws and regulations and the risks and costs of noncompliance;
•greater difficulty in identifying, attracting and retaining local qualified personnel, and the costs and expenses associated with such activities;
•greater difficulty identifying qualified channel partners and maintaining successful relationships with such partners;
•differing employment practices and labor relations issues; and
•difficulties in managing and staffing international offices and increased travel, infrastructure, and legal compliance costs associated with multiple international locations.
Additionally, nearly all of our sales contracts are currently denominated in U.S. dollars. However, a strengthening of the U.S. dollar could increase the cost of our solutions to our international customers, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations. In addition, an increasing portion of our operating expenses is incurred outside the United States, is denominated in foreign currencies, such as the British Pound, Indian Rupee, Euro, Australian Dollar, and Canadian Dollar, and is subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. If we become more exposed to currency fluctuations and are not able to successfully hedge against the risks associated with currency fluctuations, our results of operations could be adversely affected.
As we continue to develop and grow our business globally, our success will depend in large part on our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these risks. The expansion of our existing international operations and entry into additional international markets will require significant management attention and financial resources. Our failure to successfully manage our international operations and the associated risks could limit the future growth of our business.
CrowdStrike is a highly-visible public company whose management, products, business, results of operations, statements and actions are scrutinized by third-parties whose influence could negatively impact the perception of our brand and the market value of our Class A common stock.
CrowdStrike is a highly-visible public company whose management, products, business, results of operations, statements and actions are publicized. Such attention sometimes includes criticism of us by a range of third-parties. Our continued success depends on our ability to focus on executing on our mission and business plan while maintaining the trust of our current and potential customers, employees, stockholders and business partners. Any criticism, whether or not accurate, could influence the perception of our brand or our management by our customers, suppliers or investors, which could adversely impact our business prospects, operating results and the market value of our Class A common stock.
Our business is subject to the risks of earthquakes, fire, floods, outbreak of diseases and other natural catastrophic events, and to interruption by man-made problems such as power disruptions, computer viruses, data security breaches or terrorism.
Our corporate headquarters are located in the San Francisco Bay Area, a region known for seismic activity. A significant natural disaster, such as an earthquake, a fire, a flood, or significant power outage and other catastrophic events, including the occurrence of a contagious disease or illness, such as COVID-19, could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. The outbreak of a contagious disease like COVID-19 has, among other things, prompted responses such as government-imposed travel restrictions, the grounding of flights, and the shutdown of workplaces. It is not possible at this time to estimate the impact that the COVID-19 pandemic could have on our business, as the impact will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. Natural disasters and other catastrophic events such as COVID-19, could affect our personnel, recovery of our assets, data centers, supply chain, manufacturing vendors, or logistics providers’ ability to provide materials and perform services such as manufacturing products or assisting with shipments on a timely basis. In addition, climate change could result in an increase in the frequency or severity of natural disasters. In the event that our or our service providers’ information technology systems or manufacturing or logistics abilities are hindered by any of the events discussed above, shipments could be delayed, resulting in missed financial targets, such as revenue and shipment targets, for a particular quarter. In addition, computer malware, viruses and computer hacking, fraudulent use attempts, and phishing attacks have become more prevalent in our industry, and our internal systems may be victimized by
such attacks. Although we maintain incident management and disaster response plans, in the event of a major disruption caused by a natural disaster or man-made problem, we may be unable to continue our operations and may endure system interruptions, reputational harm, delays in our development activities, lengthy interruptions in service, breaches of data security and loss of critical data, and our insurance may not cover such events or may be insufficient to compensate us for the potentially significant losses we may incur. Acts of terrorism and other geopolitical unrest could also cause disruptions in our business or the business of our supply chain, manufacturers, logistics providers, partners, or customers or the economy as a whole. Any disruption in the business of our supply chain, manufacturers, logistics providers, partners or end-customers that impacts sales at the end of a fiscal quarter could have a significant adverse impact on our financial results. All of the aforementioned risks may be further increased if the disaster recovery plans for us and our suppliers prove to be inadequate. To the extent that any of the above should result in delays or cancellations of customer orders, or the delay in the manufacture, deployment or shipment of our products, our business, financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected.
Our corporate structure and intercompany arrangements are subject to the tax laws of various jurisdictions, and we could be obligated to pay additional taxes, which would harm our results of operations.
We are expanding our international operations and staff to support our business in international markets. We generally conduct our international operations through wholly-owned subsidiaries and are or may be required to report our taxable income in various jurisdictions worldwide based upon our business operations in those jurisdictions. Our intercompany relationships are subject to complex transfer pricing regulations administered by taxing authorities in various jurisdictions. The amount of taxes we pay in different jurisdictions may depend on the application of the tax laws of the various jurisdictions, including the United States, to our international business activities, changes in tax rates, new or revised tax laws or interpretations of existing tax laws and policies, and our ability to operate our business in a manner consistent with our corporate structure and intercompany arrangements. The relevant taxing authorities may disagree with our determinations as to the income and expenses attributable to specific jurisdictions. If such a disagreement were to occur, and our position was not sustained, we could be required to pay additional taxes, interest and penalties, which could result in one-time tax charges, higher effective tax rates, reduced cash flows and lower overall profitability of our operations.
We are subject to federal, state, and local income, sales, and other taxes in the United States and income, withholding, transaction, and other taxes in numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions and our worldwide provision for taxes. During the ordinary course of business, there are many activities and transactions for which the ultimate tax determination may be uncertain. In addition, our tax obligations and effective tax rates could be adversely affected by changes in the relevant tax, accounting and other laws, regulations, principles and interpretations, including those relating to income tax nexus, by recognizing tax losses or lower than anticipated earnings in jurisdictions where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated earnings in jurisdictions where we have higher statutory rates, by changes in foreign currency exchange rates, or by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities. We may be audited in various jurisdictions, and such jurisdictions may assess additional taxes, sales taxes and value added taxes against us. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of any tax audits or litigation could be materially different from our historical tax provisions and accruals, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows in the period or periods for which a determination is made.
Risks Related to Intellectual Property, Legal, and Regulatory Matters
The success of our business depends in part on our ability to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights.
We believe our intellectual property is an essential asset of our business, and our success and ability to compete depend in part upon protection of our intellectual property rights. We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions, to establish and protect our intellectual property rights in the United States and abroad, all of which provide only limited protection. The efforts we have taken to protect our intellectual property may not be sufficient or effective, and our trademarks, copyrights and patents may be held invalid or unenforceable. Moreover, we cannot assure you that any patents will be issued with respect to our currently pending patent applications in a manner that gives us adequate defensive protection or competitive advantages, or that any patents issued to us will not be challenged, invalidated or circumvented. We have filed for patents in the United States and in certain non-U.S. jurisdictions, but such protections may not be available in all countries in which we operate or in which we seek to enforce our intellectual property rights, or may be difficult to enforce in practice. For example, many foreign countries have compulsory licensing laws under which a patent owner must grant licenses to third parties. In addition, many countries limit the enforceability of patents against certain third parties, including government agencies or government contractors. In these
countries, patents may provide limited or no benefit. Moreover, we may need to expend additional resources to defend our intellectual property rights in these countries, and our inability to do so could impair our business or adversely affect our international expansion. Our currently issued patents and any patents that may be issued in the future with respect to pending or future patent applications may not provide sufficiently broad protection or they may not prove to be enforceable in actions against alleged infringers.
We may not be effective in policing unauthorized use of our intellectual property, and even if we do detect violations, litigation or technical changes to our products may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights. Protecting against the unauthorized use of our intellectual property rights, technology and other proprietary rights is expensive and difficult, particularly outside of the United States. Any enforcement efforts we undertake, including litigation, could be time-consuming and expensive and could divert management’s attention, which could harm our business and results of operations. Further, attempts to enforce our rights against third parties could also provoke these third parties to assert their own intellectual property or other rights against us, or result in a holding that invalidates or narrows the scope of our rights, in whole or in part. The inability to adequately protect and enforce our intellectual property and other proprietary rights could seriously harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. Even if we are able to secure our intellectual property rights, we cannot assure you that such rights will provide us with competitive advantages or distinguish our services from those of our competitors or that our competitors will not independently develop similar technology, duplicate any of our technology, or design around our patents.
Claims by others that we infringe their proprietary technology or other intellectual property rights could result in significant costs and substantially harm our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.
Claims by others that we infringe their proprietary technology or other intellectual property rights could harm our business. A number of companies in our industry hold a large number of patents and also protect their copyright, trade secret and other intellectual property rights, and companies in the networking and security industry frequently enter into litigation based on allegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. As we face increasing competition and grow, the possibility of intellectual property rights claims against us also grows. In addition, to the extent we hire personnel from competitors, we may be subject to allegations that such personnel have divulged proprietary or other confidential information to us. From time to time, third parties have in the past and may in the future assert claims of infringement of intellectual property rights against us. For example, we are currently involved in proceedings before the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office regarding our U.S. trademark registrations for CrowdStrike Falcon and our U.S. application to register our Falcon OverWatch trademark. Fair Isaac Corporation, or FICO, petitioned to cancel our trademark registrations and opposed our application. If the appeal board were to find against us, it would cancel our trademark registrations for CrowdStrike Falcon and reject our application to register Falcon OverWatch. If FICO were to file an infringement action in court and if we do not prevail in that action, we could ultimately be required to change the names of our solutions, which would force us to incur significant marketing expense in establishing an alternative brand to our existing Falcon brand. We cannot assure you that we will be successful in these rebranding efforts.
Third parties may in the future also assert claims against our customers or channel partners, whom our standard license and other agreements obligate us to indemnify against claims that our solutions infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties. As the number of products and competitors in the security and IT operations market increases and overlaps occur, claims of infringement, misappropriation, and other violations of intellectual property rights may increase. While we intend to increase the size of our patent portfolio, many of our competitors and others may now and in the future have significantly larger and more mature patent portfolios than we have. In addition, future litigation may involve non-practicing entities, companies or other patent owners who have no relevant product offerings or revenue and against whom our own patents may therefore provide little or no deterrence or protection. Any claim of intellectual property infringement by a third party, even a claim without merit, could cause us to incur substantial costs defending against such claim, could distract our management from our business and could require us to cease use of such intellectual property.
Additionally, our insurance may not cover intellectual property rights infringement claims that may be made. In the event that we fail to successfully defend ourselves against an infringement claim, a successful claimant could secure a judgment or otherwise require payment of legal fees, settlement payments, ongoing royalties or other costs or damages; or we may agree to a settlement that prevents us from offering certain services or features; or we may be required to obtain a license, which may not be available on reasonable terms, or at all, to use the relevant technology. If we are prevented from using certain technology or intellectual property, we may be required to develop alternative, non-infringing technology, which could require significant
time, during which we could be unable to continue to offer our affected services or features, effort and expense and may ultimately not be successful.
Although third parties may offer a license to their technology or other intellectual property, the terms of any offered license may not be acceptable, and the failure to obtain a license or the costs associated with any license could cause our business, financial condition and results of operations to be adversely affected. In addition, some licenses may be nonexclusive, and therefore our competitors may have access to the same technology licensed to us. If a third party does not offer us a license to its technology or other intellectual property on reasonable terms, or at all, we could be enjoined from continued use of such intellectual property. As a result, we may be required to develop alternative, non-infringing technology, which could require significant time, during which we could be unable to continue to offer our affected products, subscriptions or services, effort, and expense and may ultimately not be successful. Furthermore, a successful claimant could secure a judgment or we may agree to a settlement that prevents us from distributing certain products, providing certain subscriptions or performing certain services or that requires us to pay substantial damages, royalties or other fees. Any of these events could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.
We license technology from third parties, and our inability to maintain those licenses could harm our business.
We currently incorporate, and will in the future incorporate, technology that we license from third parties, including software, into our solutions. We cannot be certain that our licensors do not or will not infringe on the intellectual property rights of third parties or that our licensors have or will have sufficient rights to the licensed intellectual property in all jurisdictions in which we may sell our Falcon platform. Some of our agreements with our licensors may be terminated by them for convenience, or otherwise provide for a limited term. If we are unable to continue to license technology because of intellectual property infringement claims brought by third parties against our licensors or against us, or if we are unable to continue our license agreements or enter into new licenses on commercially reasonable terms, our ability to develop and sell solutions and services containing or dependent on that technology would be limited, and our business could be harmed. Additionally, if we are unable to license technology from third parties, we may be forced to acquire or develop alternative technology, which we may be unable to do in a commercially feasible manner or at all, and may require us to use alternative technology of lower quality or performance standards. This could limit or delay our ability to offer new or competitive solutions and increase our costs. As a result, our margins, market share, and results of operations could be significantly harmed.
If we are not able to satisfy data protection, security, privacy, and other government- and industry-specific requirements or regulations, our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be harmed.
Personal privacy, data protection, information security, telecommunications regulations, and other laws applicable to specific categories of information are significant issues in the United States, Europe and in other jurisdictions where we offer our solutions. The data that we collect, analyze, and store is subject to a variety of laws and regulations, including regulation by various government agencies. The U.S. federal government, and various state and foreign governments, have adopted or proposed limitations on the collection, distribution, use, and storage of certain categories of information, such as personally identifiable information of individuals, health information, and other sector-specific types of data, including the Federal Trade Commission, the Electronic Communication Privacy Act, Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, and the Gramm Leach Bliley Act. Laws and regulations outside the United States, and particularly in Europe, often are more restrictive than those in the United States. Such laws and regulations may require companies to implement privacy and security policies, permit customers to access, correct, and delete personal information stored or maintained by such companies, inform individuals of security breaches that affect their personal information, and, in some cases, obtain individuals’ consent to use personally identifiable information for certain purposes. In addition, some foreign governments require that any information of certain categories, such as financial or personally identifiable information collected in a country not be disseminated outside of that country. We also may find it necessary or desirable to join industry or other self-regulatory bodies or other information security or data protection-related organizations that require compliance with their rules pertaining to information security and data protection. We also may be bound by additional, more stringent contractual obligations relating to our collection, use and disclosure of personal, financial, and other data.
We also expect that there will continue to be new proposed laws, regulations, and industry standards concerning privacy, data protection, information security, specific categories of data, electronic, and telecommunications services in the United States, the European Union and other jurisdictions in which we operate or may operate, and we cannot yet determine the impact such future laws, regulations, standards, or perception of their requirements may have on our business. For example, the European Commission adopted the European General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, that became fully effective in May
2018, and applies to the processing (which includes the collection and use) of certain personal data. As compared to previously-effective data protection law in the European Union, the GDPR imposes additional obligations and risk upon our business and increases substantially the penalties to which we could be subject in the event of any non-compliance. Administrative fines under the GDPR can amount up to 20 million Euros or four percent of our worldwide annual revenue for the prior fiscal year, whichever is higher. We have incurred substantial expense in complying with the obligations imposed by the GDPR and we may be required to do so in the future, potentially making significant changes in our business operations, which may adversely affect our revenue and our business overall. Additionally, because there have been very few GDPR actions enforced against companies, we are unable to predict how they will be applied to us or our customers. Despite our efforts to attempt to comply with the GDPR, a regulator may determine that we have not done so and subject us to fines and public censure, which could harm our company. Among other requirements, the GDPR regulates transfers of personal data subject to the GDPR to third countries that have not been found to provide adequate protection to such personal data, including the United States. We have undertaken certain efforts to conform transfers of personal data from the European Economic Area, or EEA, to the United States and other jurisdictions based on our understanding of current regulatory obligations and the guidance of data protection authorities. Despite this, we may be unsuccessful in establishing or maintaining conforming means of transferring such data from the EEA, in particular as a result of continued legal and legislative activity within the European Union that has challenged or called into question the legal basis for existing means of data transfers to countries that have not been found to provide adequate protection for personal data.
The implementation of the GDPR has led other jurisdictions to either amend, or propose legislation to amend their existing data privacy and cybersecurity laws to resemble all or a portion of the requirements of the GDPR (e.g., for purposes of having an adequate level of data protection to facilitate data transfers from the EU) or enact new laws to do the same. Accordingly, the challenges we face in the EU will likely also apply to other jurisdictions outside the EU that adopt laws similar in construction to the GDPR or regulatory frameworks of equivalent complexity. For example, on June 28, 2018, California adopted the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, or CCPA, which went into effect on January 1, 2020, with enforcement commencing on July 1, 2020. The CCPA has been characterized as the first “GDPR-like” privacy statute to be enacted in the United States because it contains a number of provisions similar to certain provisions of the GDPR. In addition, the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020, or the CPRA was passed by California voters in November 2020. The CPRA amends the CCPA by creating additional privacy rights for California consumers and additional obligations on businesses, which could subject us to additional compliance costs as well as potential fines, individual claims and commercial liabilities. The majority of the CPRA provisions will take effect on January 1, 2023. The CCPA and CPRA could mark the beginning of a trend toward more stringent privacy legislation in the United States, as other states or the federal government may follow California’s lead and increase protections for U.S. residents. For example, on March 2, 2021, the Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act, which will take effect on January 1, 2023, was signed into law. The CCPA has already prompted a number of proposals for new federal and state privacy legislation that, if passed, could increase our potential liability, add layers of complexity to compliance in the U.S. market, increase our compliance costs and adversely affect our business.
Evolving and changing definitions of personal data and personal information within the European Union, the United States, and elsewhere, especially relating to classification of IP addresses, machine identification, location data and other information, may limit or inhibit our ability to operate or expand our business, including limiting technology alliance partnerships that may involve the sharing of data. Even the perception of privacy concerns, whether or not valid, may harm our reputation, inhibit adoption of our products by current and future customers, or adversely impact our ability to attract and retain workforce talent. In addition, changes in laws or regulations that adversely affect the use of the internet, including laws impacting net neutrality, could impact our business. We expect that existing laws, regulations and standards may be interpreted in new manners in the future. Future laws, regulations, standards and other obligations, and changes in the interpretation of existing laws, regulations, standards and other obligations could require us to modify our solutions, restrict our business operations, increase our costs and impair our ability to maintain and grow our customer base and increase our revenue.
Beyond broader data processing regulations affecting our business, the cybersecurity industry may face direct regulation. In 2018, Singapore introduced what is believed to be the world’s first cybersecurity licensing requirement, mandating that providers of specific types of incident response services receive a government license before providing such services. License requirements such as these may impose upon CrowdStrike significant organizational costs and high barriers of entry into new markets.
Although we work to comply with applicable laws and regulations, certain applicable industry standards with which we represent compliance, and our contractual obligations and other legal obligations, those laws, regulations, standards and obligations are evolving and may be modified, interpreted and applied in an inconsistent manner from one jurisdiction to
another, and may conflict with one another. In addition, they may conflict with other requirements or legal obligations that apply to our business or the security features and services that our customers expect from our solutions. As such, we cannot assure ongoing compliance with all such laws, regulations, standards and obligations. Any failure or perceived failure by us or our employees, representatives, contractors, channel partners, agents, intermediaries, or other third parties to comply with applicable laws and regulations, or applicable industry standards that we represent compliance with or that may be asserted to apply to us, or to comply with employee, customer, partner, and other data privacy and data security requirements pursuant to contract and our stated notices or policies, could result in enforcement actions against us, including fines, imprisonment of company officials and public censure, claims for damages by customers and other affected individuals, damage to our reputation and loss of goodwill (both in relation to existing customers and prospective customers), any of which could have a material adverse effect on our operations, financial performance and business. Any inability of us or our employees, representatives, contractors, channel partners, agents, intermediaries, or other third parties to adequately address privacy and security concerns, even if unfounded, or comply with applicable laws, regulations, standards and obligations, could result in additional cost and liability to us, damage our reputation, inhibit sales, and adversely affect our business and results of operations.
Failure to comply with laws and regulations applicable to our business could subject us to fines and penalties and could also cause us to lose customers or negatively impact our ability to contract with customers, including those in the public sector.
Our business is subject to regulation by various federal, state, local and foreign governmental agencies, including agencies responsible for monitoring and enforcing privacy and data protection laws and regulations, employment and labor laws, workplace safety, product safety, environmental laws, consumer protection laws, anti-bribery laws, import and export controls, federal securities laws and tax laws and regulations. In certain jurisdictions, these regulatory requirements may be more stringent than in the United States. Noncompliance by us, our employees, representatives, contractors, channel partners, agents, intermediaries, or other third parties with applicable regulations or requirements could subject us to:
•investigations, enforcement actions and sanctions;
•mandatory changes to our Falcon platform;
•disgorgement of profits, fines and damages;
•civil and criminal penalties or injunctions;
•claims for damages by our customers or channel partners;
•termination of contracts;
•loss of intellectual property rights;
•loss of our license to do business in the jurisdictions in which we operate; and
•temporary or permanent debarment from sales to government organizations.
If any governmental sanctions are imposed, or if we do not prevail in any possible civil or criminal litigation, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. In addition, responding to any action will likely result in a significant diversion of management’s attention and resources and an increase in professional fees. Enforcement actions and sanctions could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.
We endeavor to properly classify employees as exempt versus non-exempt under applicable law. Although there are no pending or threatened material claims or investigations against us asserting that some employees are improperly classified as exempt, the possibility exists that some of our current or former employees could have been incorrectly classified as exempt employees.
These laws and regulations impose added costs on our business, and failure by us, our employees, representatives, contractors, channel partners, agents, intermediaries, or other third parties to comply with these or other applicable regulations and requirements could lead to claims for damages, penalties, termination of contracts, loss of exclusive rights in our intellectual property and temporary suspension or permanent debarment from government contracting. Any such damages, penalties, disruptions or limitations in our ability to do business with customers, including those in the public sector, and could
result in reduced sales of our products, substantial product inventory write-offs, reputational damage, penalties, and other sanctions, any of which could harm our business, reputation, and results of operations.
We are subject to laws and regulations, including governmental export and import controls, sanctions, and anti-corruption laws, that could impair our ability to compete in our markets and subject us to liability if we are not in full compliance with applicable laws.
We are subject to laws and regulations, including governmental export controls, that could subject us to liability or impair our ability to compete in our markets. Our products are subject to U.S. export controls, including the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Export Administration Regulations, and we and our employees, representatives, contractors, agents, intermediaries, and other third parties are also subject to various economic and trade sanctions regulations administered by the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control. We incorporate standard encryption algorithms into our products, which, along with the underlying technology, may be exported outside of the U.S. only with the required export authorizations, including by license, license exception or other appropriate government authorizations, which may require the filing of an encryption registration and classification request. Furthermore, U.S. export control laws and economic sanctions prohibit the shipment of certain cloud-based solutions to countries, governments, and persons targeted by U.S. sanctions. We also collect information about cyber threats from open sources, intermediaries, and third parties that we make available to our customers in our threat industry publications. While we have implemented certain procedures to facilitate compliance with applicable laws and regulations in connection with the collection of this information, we cannot assure you that these procedures have been effective or that we, or third parties, many of whom we do not control, have complied with all laws or regulations in this regard. Failure by our employees, representatives, contractors, channel partners, agents, intermediaries, or other third parties to comply with applicable laws and regulations in the collection of this information also could have negative consequences to us, including reputational harm, government investigations and penalties.
Although we take precautions to prevent our information collection practices and services from being provided in violation of such laws, our information collection practices and services may have been in the past, and could in the future be, provided in violation of such laws. If we or our employees, representatives, contractors, channel partners, agents, intermediaries, or other third parties fail to comply with these laws and regulations, we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties, including the possible loss of export privileges and fines. We may also be adversely affected through reputational harm, loss of access to certain markets, or otherwise. Obtaining the necessary authorizations, including any required license, for a particular transaction may be time-consuming, is not guaranteed and may result in the delay or loss of sales opportunities.
Various countries regulate the import of certain encryption technology, including through import permit and license requirements, and have enacted laws that could limit our ability to distribute our products or could limit our customers’ ability to implement our products in those countries. Changes in our products or changes in export and import regulations may create delays in the introduction of our products into international markets, prevent our customers with international operations from deploying our products globally or, in some cases, prevent the export or import of our products to certain countries, governments or persons altogether. Any change in export or import regulations, economic sanctions or related legislation, shift in the enforcement or scope of existing regulations, or change in the countries, governments, persons or technologies targeted by such regulations, could result in decreased use of our products by, or in our decreased ability to export or sell our products to, existing or potential customers with international operations. Any decreased use of our products or limitation on our ability to export or sell our products would likely adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
We are also subject to the FCPA, the Bribery Act, and other anti-corruption, sanctions, anti-bribery, anti-money laundering and similar laws in the United States and other countries in which we conduct activities. Anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws, which have been enforced aggressively and are interpreted broadly, prohibit companies and their employees, agents, intermediaries, and other third parties from promising, authorizing, making or offering improper payments or other benefits to government officials and others in the private sector. We leverage third parties, including intermediaries, agents, and channel partners, to conduct our business in the U.S. and abroad, to sell subscriptions to our Falcon platform and to collect information about cyber threats. We and these third-parties may have direct or indirect interactions with officials and employees of government agencies or state-owned or affiliated entities and we may be held liable for the corrupt or other illegal activities of these third-party business partners and intermediaries, our employees, representatives, contractors, channel partners, agents, intermediaries, and other third parties, even if we do not explicitly authorize such activities. While we have policies and procedures to address compliance with the FCPA, the Bribery Act and other anti-corruption, sanctions, anti-bribery, anti-money laundering and similar laws, we cannot assure you that they will be effective, or that all of our employees, representatives, contractors, channel partners, agents, intermediaries, or other third parties have taken, or will not take actions, in violation of
our policies and applicable law, for which we may be ultimately held responsible. As we increase our international sales and business, our risks under these laws may increase. Noncompliance with these laws could subject us to investigations, severe criminal or civil sanctions, settlements, prosecution, loss of export privileges, suspension or debarment from U.S. government contracts, other enforcement actions, disgorgement of profits, significant fines, damages, other civil and criminal penalties or injunctions, whistleblower complaints, adverse media coverage and other consequences. Any investigations, actions or sanctions could harm our reputation, business, results of operations and financial condition.
Some of our technology incorporates “open source” software, which could negatively affect our ability to sell our Falcon platform and subject us to possible litigation.
Our products and subscriptions contain third-party open source software components, and failure to comply with the terms of the underlying open source software licenses could restrict our ability to sell our products and subscriptions. The use and distribution of open source software may entail greater risks than the use of third-party commercial software, as open source licensors generally do not provide warranties or other contractual protections regarding infringement claims or the quality of the code. Many of the risks associated with use of open source software cannot be eliminated and could negatively affect our business. In addition, the wide availability of source code used in our solutions could expose us to security vulnerabilities.
Some open source licenses contain requirements that we make available source code for modifications or derivative works we create based upon the type of open source software we use. If we combine our proprietary software with open source software in a certain manner, we could, under certain open source licenses, be required to release the source code of our proprietary software to the public, including authorizing further modification and redistribution, or otherwise be limited in the licensing of our services, each of which could provide an advantage to our competitors or other entrants to the market, create security vulnerabilities in our solutions, require us to re-engineer all or a portion of our Falcon platform, and could reduce or eliminate the value of our services. This would allow our competitors to create similar products with lower development effort and time and ultimately could result in a loss of sales for us.
The terms of many open source licenses have not been interpreted by U.S. courts, and there is a risk that these licenses could be construed in ways that could impose unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize products and subscriptions incorporating such software. Moreover, we cannot assure you that our processes for controlling our use of open source software in our products and subscriptions will be effective. From time to time, we may face claims from third parties asserting ownership of, or demanding release of, the open source software or derivative works that we developed using such software (which could include our proprietary source code), or otherwise seeking to enforce the terms of the applicable open source license. These claims could result in litigation. Litigation could be costly for us to defend, have a negative effect on our results of operations and financial condition or require us to devote additional research and development resources to change our solutions. Responding to any infringement or noncompliance claim by an open source vendor, regardless of its validity, discovering certain open source software code in our Falcon platform, or a finding that we have breached the terms of an open source software license, could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition, by, among other things:
•resulting in time-consuming and costly litigation;
•diverting management’s time and attention from developing our business;
•requiring us to pay monetary damages or enter into royalty and licensing agreements that we would not normally find acceptable;
•causing delays in the deployment of our Falcon platform or service offerings to our customers;
•requiring us to stop offering certain services or features of our Falcon platform;
•requiring us to redesign certain components of our Falcon platform using alternative non-infringing or non-open source technology, which could require significant effort and expense;
•requiring us to disclose our software source code and the detailed program commands for our software; and
•requiring us to satisfy indemnification obligations to our customers.
We provide service level commitments under some of our customer contracts. If we fail to meet these contractual commitments, we could be obligated to provide credits for future service and our business could suffer.
Certain of our customer agreements contain service level commitments, which contain specifications regarding the availability and performance of our Falcon platform. Any failure of or disruption to our infrastructure could impact the performance of our Falcon platform and the availability of services to customers. If we are unable to meet our stated service level commitments or if we suffer extended periods of poor performance or unavailability of our Falcon platform, we may be contractually obligated to provide affected customers with service credits for future subscriptions, and, in certain cases, refunds. To date, there has not been a material failure to meet our service level commitments, and we do not currently have any material liabilities accrued on our balance sheets for such commitments. Our revenue, other results of operations and financial condition could be harmed if we suffer performance issues or downtime that exceeds the service level commitments under our agreements with our customers.
We may become involved in litigation that may adversely affect us.
We are regularly subject to claims, suits, and government investigations and other proceedings including patent, product liability, class action, whistleblower, personal injury, property damage, labor and employment (including all allegations of wage and hour violations), commercial disputes, compliance with laws and regulatory requirements and other matters, and we may become subject to additional types of claims, suits, investigations and proceedings as our business develops. Such claims, suits, and government investigations and proceedings are inherently uncertain and their results cannot be predicted with certainty. Regardless of the outcome, any of these types of legal proceedings can have an adverse impact on us because of legal costs and diversion of management attention and resources, and could cause us to incur significant expenses or liability, adversely affect our brand recognition, and/or require us to change our business practices. The expense of litigation and the timing of this expense from period to period are difficult to estimate, subject to change and could adversely affect our results of operations. It is possible that a resolution of one or more such proceedings could result in substantial damages, settlement costs, fines and penalties that could adversely affect our business, consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows in a particular period. These proceedings could also result in reputational harm, sanctions, consent decrees, or orders requiring a change in our business practices. Because of the potential risks, expenses and uncertainties of litigation, we may, from time to time, settle disputes, even where we have meritorious claims or defenses, by agreeing to settlement agreements. Because litigation is inherently unpredictable, we cannot assure you that the results of any of these actions will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects. Any of these consequences could adversely affect our business and results of operations.
Our business is subject to the risks of warranty claims, product returns, product liability, and product defects from real or perceived defects in our solutions or their misuse by our customers or third parties and indemnity provisions in various agreements potentially expose us to substantial liability for intellectual property infringement and other losses.
We may be subject to liability claims for damages related to errors or defects in our solutions. A material liability claim or other occurrence that harms our reputation or decreases market acceptance of our products may harm our business and results of operations. Although we generally have limitation of liability provisions in our terms and conditions of sale, these provisions do not cover our indemnification obligations as described in the section titled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Indemnification” and they may not fully or effectively protect us from claims as a result of federal, state, or local laws or ordinances, or unfavorable judicial decisions in the United States or other countries. The sale and support of our products also entails the risk of product liability claims.
Additionally, our agreements with customers and other third parties typically include indemnification or other provisions under which we agree to indemnify or otherwise be liable to them for losses suffered or incurred as a result of claims regarding intellectual property infringement, breach of agreement, including confidentiality, privacy and security obligations, violation of applicable laws, damages caused by failures of our solutions or to property or persons, or other liabilities relating to or arising from our products and services, or other acts or omissions. These contractual provisions often survive termination or expiration of the applicable agreement. We have not to date received any indemnification claims from third parties. However, as we continue to grow, the possibility of these claims against us will increase.
If our customers or other third parties we do business with make intellectual property rights or other indemnification claims against us, we will incur significant legal expenses and may have to pay damages, license fees, and/or stop using technology found to be in violation of the third party’s rights. We may also have to seek a license for the technology. Such license may not
be available on reasonable terms, if at all, and may significantly increase our operating expenses or may require us to restrict our business activities and limit our ability to deliver certain solutions or features. We may also be required to develop alternative non-infringing technology, which could require significant effort and expense and/or cause us to alter our products and services, which could harm our business. Large indemnity obligations, whether for intellectual property or other claims, could harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
Additionally, our Falcon platform may be used by our customers and other third parties who obtain access to our solutions for purposes other than for which our platform was intended. For example, our Falcon platform might be misused by a customer to monitor its employee’s activities in a manner that violates the employee’s privacy rights under applicable law.
During the course of performing certain solution-related services and our professional services, our teams may have significant access to our customers’ networks. We cannot be sure that an employee may not take advantage of such access which may make our customers vulnerable to malicious activity by such employee. Any such misuse of our Falcon platform could result in negative press coverage and negatively affect our reputation, which could result in harm to our business, reputation, and results of operations.
We maintain insurance to protect against certain claims associated with the use of our products, but our insurance coverage may not adequately cover any claim asserted against us. In addition, even claims that ultimately are unsuccessful could result in our expenditure of funds in litigation, divert management’s time and other resources, and harm our business and reputation. We offer our Falcon Complete customers a limited warranty, subject to certain conditions, and our potential liability under this warranty is provided by our insurance carrier to us. Any failure or refusal of our insurance providers to provide the expected insurance benefits to us after we have paid the warranty claims would cause us to incur significant expense or cause us to cease offering this warranty which could damage our reputation, cause us to lose customers, expose us to liability claims by our customers, negatively impact our sales and marketing efforts, and have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Risks Related to Ownership of Our Class A Common Stock
The market price of our Class A common stock may be volatile, and you could lose all or part of your investment.
We cannot predict the prices at which our Class A common stock will trade. The market price of our Class A common stock depends on a number of factors, including those described in this “Risk Factors” section, many of which are beyond our control and may not be related to our operating performance. In addition, the limited public float of our Class A common stock tends to increase the volatility of the trading price of our Class A common stock. These fluctuations could cause you to lose all or part of your investment in our Class A common stock. Factors that could cause fluctuations in the market price of our Class A common stock include the following:
•actual or anticipated changes or fluctuations in our results of operations;
•the financial projections we may provide to the public, any changes in these projections or our failure to meet these projections;
•announcements by us or our competitors of new products or new or terminated significant contracts, commercial relationships or capital commitments;
•industry or financial analyst or investor reaction to our press releases, other public announcements and filings with the SEC;
•rumors and market speculation involving us or other companies in our industry;
•price and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market from time to time;
•changes in operating performance and stock market valuations of other technology companies generally, or those in our industry in particular;
•failure of industry or financial analysts to maintain coverage of us, changes in financial estimates by any analysts who follow our company, or our failure to meet these estimates or the expectations of investors;
•actual or anticipated developments in our business or our competitors’ businesses or the competitive landscape generally;
•litigation involving us, our industry or both, or investigations by regulators into our operations or those of our competitors;
•developments or disputes concerning our intellectual property rights or our solutions, or third-party proprietary rights;
•announced or completed acquisitions of businesses or technologies by us or our competitors;
•new laws or regulations or new interpretations of existing laws or regulations applicable to our business;
•any major changes in our management or our board of directors, particularly with respect to Mr. Kurtz;
•effects of public health crises, pandemics and epidemics, such as COVID-19;
•general economic conditions and slow or negative growth of our markets; and
•other events or factors, including those resulting from war, incidents of terrorism or responses to these events.
In addition, the stock market in general, and the market for technology companies in particular, has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. Broad market and industry factors may seriously affect the market price of our Class A common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance. In addition, in the past, following periods of volatility in the overall market and the market prices of a particular company’s securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against that company. Securities litigation, if instituted against us, could result in substantial costs and divert our management’s attention and resources from our business. This could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
Sales of substantial amounts of our Class A common stock in the public markets, or the perception that they might occur, could reduce the price that our Class A common stock might otherwise attain and may dilute your voting power and your ownership interest in us.
Sales of a substantial number of shares of our Class A common stock in the public market, including shares of Class A stock that have been converted from shares of Class B common stock, and particularly sales by our directors, executive officers and significant stockholders, or the perception that these sales could occur, could adversely affect the market price of our Class A common stock. As of February 28, 2021, we had 195,247,309 shares of Class A common stock outstanding and 28,628,920 shares of Class B common stock outstanding.
All of the shares of Class A common stock sold in our initial public offering are freely tradable without restrictions or further registration under the Securities Act of 1933, except for any shares held by our affiliates as defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act.
In addition, certain holders of our Class B common stock are entitled to rights with respect to registration of these shares under the Securities Act pursuant to our amended and restated registration rights agreement. If these holders of our Class B common stock, by exercising their registration rights, sell a large number of shares, they could adversely affect the market price for our Class A common stock.
We may also issue our shares of Class A common stock or securities convertible into shares of our Class A common stock from time to time in connection with a financing, acquisition, investments or otherwise. Any such issuance could result in substantial dilution to our existing stockholders and cause the market price of our Class A common stock to decline.
If industry or financial analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, or if they issue inaccurate or unfavorable research regarding our Class A common stock, our stock price and trading volume could decline.
The trading market for our Class A common stock will be influenced by the research and reports that industry or financial analysts publish about us or our business. We do not control these analysts or the content and opinions included in their reports. As a new public company, the analysts who publish information about our Class A common stock have had relatively little experience with our company, which could affect their ability to accurately forecast our results and make it more likely that we fail to meet their estimates. If any of the analysts who cover us issues an inaccurate or unfavorable opinion regarding our stock price, our stock price would likely decline. In addition, the stock prices of many companies in the technology industry have declined significantly after those companies have failed to meet, or significantly exceed, the financial guidance publicly announced by the companies or the expectations of analysts. If our financial results fail to meet, or significantly exceed, our announced guidance or the expectations of analysts or public investors, analysts could downgrade our Class A common stock or publish unfavorable research about us. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to publish reports on us regularly, our visibility in the financial markets could decrease, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.
The dual class structure of our common stock has the effect of concentrating voting control with those stockholders who held our capital stock (or options or other securities convertible into or exercisable for our capital stock) prior to the completion of our initial public offering, including our executive officers, employees, directors, principal stockholders, and their affiliates, which will limit your ability to influence the outcome of matters submitted to our stockholders for approval.
Our Class B common stock has 10 votes per share, and our Class A common stock has one vote per share. The dual class structure of our common stock has the effect of concentrating voting control with those stockholders who held our capital stock (or options or other securities convertible into or exercisable for our capital stock) prior to our initial public offering, including our executive officers, employees, directors, principal stockholders, and their affiliates, which will limit your ability to influence the outcome of matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, including the election of our directors and the approval of any change in control transaction. Future transfers by holders of Class B common stock will generally result in those shares converting to Class A common stock, which will have the effect, over time, of increasing the relative voting power of those holders of Class B common stock who retain their shares in the long term.
As of January 31, 2021, our executive officers, directors, one of our current stockholders and its respective affiliates held, in aggregate, 58% of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock. Furthermore, one of our current stockholders and its respective affiliates held, in aggregate, 24% of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock. As a result, these stockholders, acting together, have control over most matters that require approval by our stockholders, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions. They may also have interests that differ from yours and may vote in a way with which you disagree and which may be adverse to your interests. Corporate action might be taken even if other stockholders, including those who purchased shares in our initial public offering, oppose them. This concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying, preventing or deterring a change of control or other liquidity event of our company, could deprive our stockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their shares of common stock as part of a sale or other liquidity event and might ultimately affect the market price of our common stock.
Further, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the doctrine of “corporate opportunity” does not apply to Accel, or its respective affiliates, in a manner that would prohibit them from investing in competing businesses or doing business with our partners or customers.
Shares of our common stock are subordinate to our debts and other liabilities, resulting in a greater risk of loss for stockholders.
Shares of our common stock are subordinate in right of payment to all of our current and future debt. We cannot assure that there would be any remaining funds after the payment of all of our debts for any distribution to our common stockholders.
We do not intend to pay dividends in the foreseeable future. As a result, your ability to achieve a return on your investment will depend on appreciation in the price of our Class A common stock.
We have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our capital stock. We currently intend to retain all available funds and any future earnings for use in the operation of our business and do not anticipate paying any dividends in the foreseeable future. Any determination to pay dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our board of directors. Additionally, our ability to pay dividends is limited by restrictions on our ability to pay dividends or make distributions under the terms of our credit facility. Accordingly, investors must rely on sales of their Class A common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any future gains on their investments.
The issuance of additional stock in connection with financings, acquisitions, investments, our stock incentive plans, or otherwise will dilute all other stockholders.
Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue up to 2,000,000,000 shares of Class A common stock, up to 300,000,000 shares of Class B common stock, and up to 100,000,000 shares of preferred stock with such rights and preferences as may be determined by our board of directors. Subject to compliance with applicable rules and regulations, we may issue shares of Class A common stock or securities convertible into shares of our Class A common stock from time to time in connection with a financing, acquisition, investment, our stock incentive plans or otherwise. Any such issuance could result in substantial dilution to our existing stockholders and cause the market price of our Class A common stock to decline.
Certain provisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could make an acquisition of our company more difficult, limit attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove members of our board of directors or current management, and may adversely affect the market price of our Class A common stock.
Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that could delay or prevent a change in control of our company. These provisions could also make it difficult for stockholders to elect directors that are not nominated by the current members of our board of directors or take other corporate actions, including effecting changes in our management. These provisions include:
•our dual class common stock structure, which provides our holders of Class B common stock with the ability to significantly influence the outcome of matters requiring stockholder approval, even if they own significantly less than a majority of the shares of our outstanding Class A and Class B common stock;
•a classified board of directors with three-year staggered terms, which could delay the ability of stockholders to change the membership of a majority of our board of directors;
•the ability of our board of directors to issue shares of preferred stock and to determine the price and other terms of those shares, including preferences and voting rights, without stockholder approval, which could be used to significantly dilute the ownership of a hostile acquirer;
•the exclusive right of our board of directors to elect a director to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of our board of directors or the resignation, death or removal of a director, which prevents stockholders from being able to fill vacancies on our board of directors;
•a prohibition on stockholder action by written consent, which forces stockholder action to be taken at an annual or special meeting of our stockholders, which prohibition will take effect on the first date on which the number of outstanding shares of our Class B common stock represents less than 10% of the aggregate number of outstanding shares of our Class A common stock and our Class B common stock, taken together as a single class;
•the requirement that a special meeting of stockholders may be called only by the chairperson of our board of directors, chief executive officer or by the board of directors acting pursuant to a resolution adopted by a majority of our board of directors, which could delay the ability of our stockholders to force consideration of a proposal or to take action, including the removal of directors;
•certain amendments to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation require the approval of two-thirds of the then-outstanding voting power of our capital stock; and
•advance notice procedures with which stockholders must comply to nominate candidates to our board of directors or to propose matters to be acted upon at a stockholders’ meeting, which may discourage or deter a potential acquirer from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquirer’s own slate of directors or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us.
These provisions may prohibit large stockholders, in particular those owning 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock, from merging or combining with us for a certain period of time.
Our amended and restated bylaws provide that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, and to the extent enforceable, the federal district courts of the United States, will be the exclusive forum for certain disputes between us and our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders’ ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or employees.
Our amended and restated bylaws provide that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the exclusive forum for:
•any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf;
•any action asserting a breach of fiduciary duty;
•any action asserting a claim against us arising under the Delaware General Corporation Law, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or our amended and restated bylaws;
•any action to interpret, apply, enforce or determine the validity of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or our amended and restated bylaws; and
•any action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal-affairs doctrine.
However, this exclusive forum provision does not apply to suits brought to enforce a duty or liability created by the Exchange Act. In addition, our amended and restated bylaws provide that the federal district courts of the United States will be the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act, subject to and contingent upon a final adjudication in the State of Delaware of the enforceability of such exclusive forum provision.
These exclusive-forum provisions may limit a stockholder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees, which may discourage lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and other employees.
Risks Related to our Indebtedness
Our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition.
As of January 31, 2021, we had $750.0 million of indebtedness outstanding (excluding intercompany indebtedness) and there is additional availability under our revolving facility of up to $750.0 million (excluding issued but undrawn letters of credit). Our indebtedness could have important consequences, including:
•limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general corporate requirements;
•requiring a portion of our cash flows to be dedicated to debt service payments instead of other purposes, thereby reducing the amount of cash flows available for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes;
•increasing our vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic, industry and competitive conditions;
•exposing us to the risk of increased interest rates as certain of our borrowings, including borrowings under our revolving facility, are at variable rates of interest; and increasing our cost of borrowing.
In addition, our revolving facility and the indenture that governs our Senior Notes contain restrictive covenants that limit our ability to engage in activities that may be in our long-term best interest. Our failure to comply with those covenants could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of substantially all of our indebtedness.
We may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness, including the notes, and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness, which may not be successful.
Our ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our debt obligations, including the Senior Notes, depends on our financial condition and results of operations, which in turn are subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business and other factors beyond our control. We may not be able to maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness, including the notes.
If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we could face substantial liquidity problems and may be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures, or to sell assets, seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness, including the Senior Notes. Our ability to restructure or refinance our debt will depend on, among other things, the condition of the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. Any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business operations. The terms of existing or future debt instruments and the indenture that governs the Senior Notes may restrict us from adopting some of these alternatives. In addition, any failure to make payments of interest and principal on our outstanding indebtedness on a timely basis would likely result in a reduction of our credit rating, which could harm our ability to incur additional indebtedness. In the absence of such cash flows and resources, we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt service and other obligations.
Further, our credit agreement contains provisions that restrict our ability to dispose of assets and use the proceeds from any such disposition. We may not be able to consummate those dispositions or to obtain the proceeds that we could realize from them and these proceeds may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations then due. These alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations.
Our inability to generate sufficient cash flows to satisfy our debt obligations, or to refinance our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all, would materially and adversely affect our financial position and results of operations.
If we cannot make scheduled payments on our indebtedness, we will be in default and holders of our Senior Notes could declare all outstanding principal and interest to be due and payable, the lenders under our revolving facility could terminate their commitments to loan money, our secured lenders could foreclose against the assets securing their borrowings and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation. If we breach the covenants under our debt instruments, we would be in default under such instruments. The holders of such indebtedness could exercise their rights, as described above, and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation.
Our revolving facility and the indenture that governs our Senior Notes contain terms which restrict our current and future operations, particularly our ability to respond to changes or to take certain actions.
Our revolving facility and the indenture that governs our Senior Notes contain a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and may limit our ability to engage in acts that may be in our long-term best interest, including, among other things, restrictions on our ability to:
•incur additional indebtedness and guarantee indebtedness;
•prepay, redeem or repurchase certain indebtedness;
•sell or otherwise dispose of assets;
•incur liens;
•enter into transactions with affiliates;
•alter the businesses we conduct;
•enter into agreements restricting our subsidiaries’ ability to pay dividends; and
•consolidate, merge with, or sell all or substantially all of our assets to, another person.
The covenants in the indenture and supplemental indenture that govern the Senior Notes are subject to exceptions and qualifications.
In addition, the restrictive covenants in the credit agreement governing our revolving facility require us to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy other financial condition tests. Our ability to meet those financial ratios and tests can be affected by events beyond our control, and we may not be able to meet them. These restrictive covenants could adversely affect our ability to:
•finance our operations;
•make needed capital expenditures;
•make strategic acquisitions or investments or enter into joint ventures;
•withstand a future downturn in our business, the industry or the economy in general;
•engage in business activities, including future opportunities, that may be in our best interest; and
•plan for or react to market conditions or otherwise execute our business strategies.
These restrictions may affect our ability to expand our business, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
As a result of these restrictions, we will be limited as to how we conduct our business and we may be unable to raise additional debt or equity financing to compete effectively or to take advantage of new business opportunities. The terms of any future indebtedness we may incur could include more restrictive covenants. We cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain compliance with these covenants in the future and, if we fail to do so, that we will be able to obtain waivers from the lenders and/or amend the covenants.
Our failure to comply with the restrictive covenants described above and/or the terms of any future indebtedness from time to time could result in an event of default, which, if not cured or waived, could result in our being required to repay these borrowings before their due date. If we are forced to refinance these borrowings on less favorable terms or cannot refinance these borrowings, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.
Our revolving facility and the indenture that governs our Senior Notes contain cross-default provisions that could result in the acceleration of all of our indebtedness.
A breach of the covenants under our revolving facility or the indenture that governs our Senior Notes could result in an event of default under the applicable indebtedness. Such a default may allow the creditors to accelerate the related indebtedness and may result in the acceleration of any other indebtedness to which a cross-acceleration or cross-default provision applies. In addition, an event of default under the credit agreement governing our revolving facility would permit the lenders under our revolving facility to terminate all commitments to extend further credit under that facility. Furthermore, if we were unable to repay amounts due and payable under our revolving facility, those lenders could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness. In the event our lenders or noteholders accelerate the repayment of our borrowings, we and our guarantors may not have sufficient assets to repay that indebtedness. Additionally, we may not be able to borrow money from other lenders to enable us to refinance our indebtedness.
The phase-out, replacement or unavailability of LIBOR could adversely affect our cost of capital or our financial condition.
The head of the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority has announced the desire to phase out the use of LIBOR by the end of 2021. Our revolving facility provides that LIBOR may be substituted in certain circumstances with an alternative benchmark interest rate, subject to notice to all lenders and the absence of objection by the lenders. Any such substitution could have an adverse impact on our cost of capital. Currently, there is no definitive information regarding which alternative benchmark interest rate that will replace LIBOR, how such alternative benchmark interest rate may differ from LIBOR, and when such substitution may occur. As such, we cannot determine the potential effect of such transition on our financial condition.
General Risk Factors
If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, our ability to produce timely and accurate financial statements or comply with applicable regulations could be impaired.
We are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (Sarbanes-Oxley Act), the rules and regulations of Nasdaq, and other securities rules and regulations that impose various requirements on public companies. Our management and other personnel devote substantial time and resources to comply with these rules and regulations. Such compliance has increased, and will continue to increase our legal, accounting and financial compliance costs; make some activities more difficult, time-consuming and costly, and place significant strain on our personnel, systems and resources. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. We are continuing to develop and refine our disclosure controls, internal control over financial reporting and other procedures that are designed to ensure information required to be disclosed by us in our financial statements and in the reports that we file with the SEC is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and information required to be disclosed in reports under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our principal executive and financial officers.
Our current controls and any new controls we develop may become inadequate because of changes in conditions in our business. Additionally, to the extent we acquire other businesses, the acquired company may not have a sufficiently robust system of internal controls and we may uncover new deficiencies. Weaknesses in our internal controls may be discovered in the future. Any failure to develop or maintain effective controls, or any difficulties encountered in their implementation or improvement, could harm our results of operations, may result in a restatement of our financial statements for prior periods, cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations, and could result in an adverse opinion regarding our internal control over financial reporting from our independent registered public accounting firm, and lead to investigations or sanctions by regulatory authorities.
Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, requires our management to certify financial and other information in our quarterly and annual reports and provide an annual management report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. We are also required to have our independent registered public accounting firm attest to, and issue an opinion on, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. If we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, or if, when required, our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to express an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, which would cause the price of our Class A common stock to decline.
Any failure to maintain effective disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting could have a material and adverse effect on our business and results of operations and could cause a decline in the price of our stock.
Future acquisitions, strategic investments, partnerships, or alliances could be difficult to identify and integrate, divert the attention of key management personnel, disrupt our business, dilute stockholder value and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
As part of our business strategy, we have in the past and expect to continue to make investments in and/or acquire complementary companies, services or technologies. Our ability as an organization to acquire and integrate other companies, services or technologies in a successful manner in the future is not guaranteed. We may not be able to find suitable acquisition candidates, and we may not be able to complete such acquisitions on favorable terms, if at all. If we do complete acquisitions,
we may not ultimately strengthen our competitive position or ability to achieve our business objectives, and any acquisitions we complete could be viewed negatively by our end-customers or investors. In addition, our due diligence may fail to identify all of the problems, liabilities or other shortcomings or challenges of an acquired business, product or technology, including issues related to intellectual property, product quality or product architecture, regulatory compliance practices, revenue recognition or other accounting practices or issues with employees or customers. If we are unsuccessful at integrating such acquisitions, or the technologies associated with such acquisitions, into our company, the revenue and results of operations of the combined company could be adversely affected. Any integration process may require significant time and resources, and we may not be able to manage the process successfully. We may not successfully evaluate or utilize the acquired technology or personnel, or accurately forecast the financial impact of an acquisition transaction, including accounting charges. We may have to pay cash, incur debt or issue equity securities to pay for any such acquisition, each of which could adversely affect our financial condition and the market price of our Class A common stock. The sale of equity or issuance of debt to finance any such acquisitions could result in dilution to our stockholders. The incurrence of indebtedness would result in increased fixed obligations and could also include covenants or other restrictions that would impede our ability to manage our operations.
Additional risks we may face in connection with acquisitions include:
•diversion of management time and focus from operating our business to addressing acquisition integration challenges;
•coordination of research and development and sales and marketing functions
•integration of product and service offerings;
•retention of key employees from the acquired company;
•changes in relationships with strategic partners as a result of product acquisitions or strategic positioning resulting from the acquisition;
•cultural challenges associated with integrating employees from the acquired company into our organization;
•integration of the acquired company’s accounting, management information, human resources and other administrative systems;
•the need to implement or improve controls, procedures, and policies at a business that prior to the acquisition may have lacked sufficiently effective controls, procedures and policies;
•additional legal, regulatory or compliance requirements;
•financial reporting, revenue recognition or other financial or control deficiencies of the acquired company that we do not adequately address and that cause our reported results to be incorrect;
•liability for activities of the acquired company before the acquisition, including intellectual property infringement claims, violations of laws, commercial disputes, tax liabilities and other known and unknown liabilities;
•unanticipated write-offs or charges; and
•litigation or other claims in connection with the acquired company, including claims from terminated employees, customers, former stockholders or other third parties.
Our failure to address these risks or other problems encountered in connection with acquisitions and investments could cause us to fail to realize the anticipated benefits of these acquisitions or investments, cause us to incur unanticipated liabilities, and harm our business generally.
Our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited.
As of January 31, 2021, we had aggregate U.S. federal and California net operating loss carryforwards of $1.1 billion and $122.6 million, respectively, which may be available to offset future taxable income for income tax purposes. If not utilized, the federal and California net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in 2031. As of January 31, 2021, we had net
operating loss carryforwards for other states of $660.7 million that will begin to expire in 2024. As of January 31, 2021, we had federal and California research and development credit carryforwards of $38.7 million and $8.7 million, respectively. The federal research and development credit carryforwards will begin to expire in 2031, and the California carryforwards are carried forward indefinitely. As of January 31, 2021, we had aggregate United Kingdom net operating loss carryforwards of $50.2 million which are carried forward indefinitely. Realization of these net operating loss and research and development credit carryforwards depends on future income, and there is a risk that our existing carryforwards could expire unused and be unavailable to offset future income tax liabilities, which could adversely affect our results of operations.
In addition, under Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code, if a corporation undergoes an “ownership change,” generally defined as a greater than 50% change (by value) in ownership by “5 percent shareholders” over a rolling three-year period, the corporation’s ability to use its pre-change net operating loss carryovers and other pre-change tax attributes, such as research and development credits, to offset its post-change income or taxes may be limited. We may experience ownership changes in the future as a result of shifts in our stock ownership. As a result, if we earn net taxable income, our ability to use our pre-change net operating loss carryforwards to offset U.S. federal taxable income may be subject to limitations, which could potentially result in increased future tax liability to us.
Taxing authorities may successfully assert that we should have collected or in the future should collect sales and use, value added or similar taxes, and we could be subject to liability with respect to past or future sales, which could adversely affect our results of operations.
We do not collect sales and use, value added or similar taxes in all jurisdictions in which we have sales because we have been advised that such taxes are not applicable to our services in certain jurisdictions. Sales and use, value added, and similar tax laws and rates vary greatly by jurisdiction. Certain jurisdictions in which we do not collect such taxes may assert that such taxes are applicable, which could result in tax assessments, penalties and interest, to us or our customers for the past amounts, and we may be required to collect such taxes in the future. If we are unsuccessful in collecting such taxes from our customers, we could be held liable for such costs, which may adversely affect our results of operations.
If our estimates or judgments relating to our critical accounting policies prove to be incorrect or financial reporting standards or interpretations change, our results of operations could be adversely affected.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, as discussed in the section titled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” The results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets, liabilities and equity, and the amount of revenue and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. Significant assumptions and estimates used in preparing our consolidated financial statements include those related to revenue recognition; allowance for doubtful accounts; valuation of common stock and redeemable convertible preferred stock warrants; carrying value and useful lives of long-lived assets; loss contingencies; and the provision for income taxes and related deferred taxes. Additionally, as a result of the global COVID-19 pandemic, many of management’s estimates and assumptions require increased judgment and carry a higher degree of variability and volatility. Our results of operations may be adversely affected if our assumptions change or if actual circumstances differ from those in our assumptions, which could cause our results of operations to fall below the expectations of industry or financial analysts and investors, resulting in a decline in the market price of our Class A common stock.
Additionally, we regularly monitor our compliance with applicable financial reporting standards and review new pronouncements and drafts thereof that are relevant to us. As a result of new standards, changes to existing standards and changes in their interpretation, we might be required to change our accounting policies, alter our operational policies and implement new or enhance existing systems so that they reflect new or amended financial reporting standards, or we may be required to restate our published financial statements. Such changes to existing standards or changes in their interpretation may have an adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial position and profit, or cause an adverse deviation from our revenue and operating profit target, which may negatively impact our financial results.","Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments
None.","Item 2. Properties
Our corporate headquarters occupies approximately 68,791 square feet in Sunnyvale, California under a lease that expires in 2025. We also lease offices in California, Maryland, Missouri, Minnesota, Texas, Virginia, Oregon, and Washington, as well as locations internationally, including in Australia, Germany, India, Romania, Japan, Israel, Spain, the United Arab Emirates, Singapore, and the United Kingdom.
We believe that our existing facilities are sufficient for our current needs. In the future, we may need to add new facilities and expand our existing facilities as we add employees, grow our infrastructure and evolve our business, and we believe that suitable additional or substitute space will be available on commercially reasonable terms to meet our future needs.","Item 3. Legal Proceedings
We are currently a party to, and may from time to time in the future be involved in, various litigation matters and subject to claims that arise in the ordinary course of business, including claims asserted by third parties in the form of letters and other communications. For information regarding legal proceedings and other claims in which we are involved, see Note 12, “Commitments and Contingencies” in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
For any claims for which we believe a liability is both probable and reasonably estimable, we record a liability in the period for which it makes this determination. There is no pending or threatened legal proceeding to which we are a party that, in our opinion, is likely to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements; however, the results of litigation and claims are inherently unpredictable. Regardless of the outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on our business because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources, and other factors. In addition, the expense of litigation and the timing of this expense from period to period are difficult to estimate, subject to change and could adversely affect our consolidated financial statements.","Item 4.

The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, including those described under the heading “Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.” You should review the disclosure under Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis. Our fiscal years ended January 31, 2021, January 31, 2020, and January 31, 2019, are referred to herein as fiscal 2021, fiscal 2020, and fiscal 2019, respectively.
Overview
We founded CrowdStrike in 2011 to reinvent security for the cloud era. When we started the company, cyberattackers had a decided, asymmetric advantage over existing security products. We turned the tables on the adversaries by taking a fundamentally new approach that leverages the network effects of crowdsourced data applied to modern technologies such as AI, cloud computing, and graph databases. Realizing that the nature of cybersecurity problems had changed but the solutions had not, we built our CrowdStrike Falcon platform to detect threats and stop breaches.
We believe we are defining a new category called the Security Cloud, with the power to transform the security industry much the same way the cloud has transformed the customer relationship management, human resources, and service management industries. With our Falcon platform, we created the first multi-tenant, cloud native, intelligent security solution capable of protecting workloads across on-premise, virtualized, and cloud-based environments running on a variety of endpoints such as desktops, laptops, servers, virtual machines, cloud workloads, cloud containers, mobile, and IoT devices. Our Falcon platform is composed of two tightly integrated proprietary technologies: our easily deployed intelligent lightweight agent and our cloud-based, dynamic graph database called Threat Graph. Our solution benefits from crowdsourcing and economies of scale, which we believe enables our AI algorithms to be uniquely effective. We call this cloud-scale AI. Our single lightweight agent is installed on each endpoint or the cloud workload host and provides local detection and prevention capabilities while also intelligently collecting and streaming high fidelity data to our platform for real-time decision-making. Our Threat Graph processes, correlates, and analyzes this data in the cloud using a combination of AI and behavioral pattern-matching techniques. By analyzing and correlating information across our massive, crowdsourced dataset, we are able to deploy our AI algorithms at cloud-scale and build a more intelligent, effective solution to detect threats and stop breaches that on-premise or single instance cloud products cannot match. Today, we offer 19 cloud modules via a SaaS subscription-based model that spans multiple large markets, including corporate workload security, security and vulnerability management, managed security services, IT operations management, threat intelligence services, identity protection and log management.
On June 14, 2019 we closed our initial public offering, or IPO, in which we issued and sold 20,700,000 shares of Class A common stock. The price per share to the public was $34.00. We received aggregate proceeds of $665.1 million from the IPO, net of underwriters’ discounts and commissions and before deducting estimated offering costs of $5.9 million. Upon the closing of the IPO, all shares of our outstanding preferred stock automatically converted into 131,267,586 shares of Class B common stock. In connection with our IPO, all shares of our common stock outstanding prior to our IPO were automatically converted into shares of Class B common stock.
In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak to be a pandemic. Since then, the COVID-19 pandemic has rapidly spread across the globe and has already resulted in significant volatility, uncertainty, and economic disruption. Thus far, the impact of the pandemic has been modest with some customers, particularly in heavily impacted industries, requesting special billing or payment terms. Our gross retention rate for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 remained consistently high and our dollar-based net retention rate once again exceeded 120 percent as we continued to expand module adoption within new and existing customers. In March 2020, we implemented several measures to help protect the health and safety of our employees around the globe including restricting all travel and transitioning 100% of our workforce to be remote. In addition, in response to the uncertain macroeconomic environment, we converted all of our marketable securities to cash and cash equivalents, and as of January 31, 2021, all of our investments were classified as cash.
We continue to conduct business as usual with modifications to employee travel, employee work locations, customer interactions, and cancellation of certain marketing events, among other things. We will continue to actively monitor the situation and may take further actions that alter our business operations as may be required by federal, state, or local authorities, or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, customers, partners, suppliers, and stockholders. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic may impact our longer-term operational and financial performance remains uncertain. Furthermore, due to our subscription-based business model, the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic may not be fully reflected in our results of operations until future periods, if at all. The extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic will depend on several factors, including the pace of reopening the economy around the world; the possible resurgence in the spread of the virus; the development cycle of therapeutics and vaccines; the impact on our customers and our sales cycles; the impact on our customer, employee, and industry events; and the effect on our vendors. Please see Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a further description of the material risks we currently face, including risks related to the COVID-19 pandemic.
In March 2020, we launched two initiatives to help our customers quickly onboard new remote workers without sacrificing protection or having to worry about a procurement cycle. This included a surge relief plan that allows our customers to surge the number of endpoints for a limited time. Additionally, we launched a Falcon Prevent for Home Use program that allows our customers’ company administrators to install Falcon Prevent on their employees’ home systems. We believe both of these initiatives have been well received by our customers.
On September 30, 2020, we acquired Preempt Security, a privately-held Delaware corporation that developed real-time access control and threat prevention technology (the “Acquisition”). The total consideration transferred was $91.2 million which consisted of $87.4 million in cash and $3.8 million representing the fair value of replacement equity awards attributable to pre-acquisition service. The purchase price was allocated, on a preliminary basis, to identified intangible assets, which include developed technology, customer relationships and trade names, of $16.4 million, net tangible assets acquired of $(0.5) million and goodwill of $75.3 million, representing the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired. With this acquisition, we plan to offer customers enhanced Zero Trust security capabilities and strengthen our Falcon platform with conditional access technology. The addition of Preempt Security’s technology to the Falcon platform will help customers achieve end-to-end visibility and enforcement on identity data.
On January 4, 2021, we amended and restated our existing credit agreement (the “A&R Credit Agreement” and the facility thereunder the “Revolving Facility”) among CrowdStrike, Inc., as borrower, CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc., as guarantor, and Silicon Valley Bank and the other lenders party thereto, providing us with a revolving line of credit of up to $750.0 million, including a letter of credit sub-facility in the aggregate amount of $100.0 million, and a swingline sub-facility in the aggregate amount of $50.0 million. We also have the option to request an incremental facility of up to an additional $250.0 million from one or more of the lenders under the A&R Credit Agreement. The A&R Credit Agreement is guaranteed by all of our material domestic subsidiaries. The maturity date under the A&R Credit Agreement is January 2, 2026.
On January 20, 2021, we issued and sold $750.0 million aggregate principal amount of 3.000% Senior Notes due 2029 (the “Senior Notes”). The Senior Notes are guaranteed by one of our subsidiaries, CrowdStrike, Inc., as of the closing date, and thereafter will be guaranteed by any of our domestic subsidiaries that become borrowers or guarantors under our senior secured revolving credit facility. The Senior Notes and the guarantee are general unsecured senior obligations and rank equal in right of payment to all of our existing and future senior indebtedness. Interest will be payable semi-annually at a rate of 3.000% per year. The Senior Notes will mature on February 15, 2029. We may redeem the Senior Notes prior to maturity under certain circumstances. The net proceeds from the debt offering were $739.6 million after deducting the underwriting commissions of $9.4 million and $1.0 million of issuance costs, which were paid as of January 31, 2021.
Our Go-To-Market Strategy
We sell subscriptions to our Falcon platform and cloud modules to organizations across multiple industries. We primarily sell subscriptions to our Falcon platform and cloud modules through our direct sales team that leverages our network of channel partners. Our direct sales team is comprised of field sales and inside sales professionals who are segmented by a customer’s number of endpoints.
We have a low friction land-and-expand sales strategy. When customers deploy our Falcon platform, they can start with any number of cloud modules and we can activate additional cloud modules in real time on the same agent already deployed on the endpoint. This architecture has also allowed us to begin to offer a free trial of our Falcon Prevent module directly from our website or the AWS Marketplace, and we plan to extend this capability to additional modules in the future. Once customers experience the benefits of our Falcon platform, they often expand their adoption over time by adding more endpoints or purchasing additional modules. We also use our sales team to identify current customers who may be interested in free trials of additional cloud modules, which serves as a powerful driver of our land-and-expand model. By segmenting our sales teams, we can deploy a low-touch sales model that efficiently identifies prospective customers.
We began as a solution for large enterprises, but the flexibility and scalability of our Falcon platform has enabled us to seamlessly offer our solution to customers of any size-from those with hundreds of thousands of endpoints to as few as three. We have expanded our sales focus to include any organization without the need to modify our Falcon platform for small and medium sized businesses.
A substantial majority of our customers purchase subscriptions with a term of one year. Our subscriptions are generally priced on a per-endpoint and per-module basis. We recognize revenue from our subscriptions ratably over the term of the subscription. We also generate revenue from our incident response and proactive professional services, which are generally priced on a time and materials basis. We view our professional services business primarily as an opportunity to cross-sell subscriptions to our Falcon platform and cloud modules.
Certain Factors Affecting Our Performance
Adoption of Our Solutions. We believe our future success depends in large part on the growth in the market for cloud-based SaaS-delivered endpoint security solutions. Many organizations have not yet abandoned the on-premise legacy products in which they have invested substantial personnel and financial resources to design and maintain. As a result, it is difficult to predict customer adoption rates and demand for our cloud-based solutions.
New Customer Acquisition. Our future growth depends in large part on our ability to acquire new customers. If our efforts to attract new customers are not successful, our revenue and rate of revenue growth may decline. We believe that our go-to-market strategy and the flexibility and scalability of our Falcon platform allow us to rapidly expand our customer base. Our incident response and proactive services also help drive new customer acquisitions, as many of these professional services customers subsequently purchase subscriptions to our Falcon platform. Many organizations have not yet adopted cloud-based security solutions, and since our Falcon platform has offerings for organizations of all sizes, worldwide, and across industries, we believe this presents a significant opportunity for growth.
Maintain Customer Retention and Increase Sales. Our ability to increase revenue depends in large part on our ability to retain our existing customers and increase the ARR of their subscriptions. We focus on increasing sales to our existing customers by expanding their deployments to more endpoints and selling additional cloud modules for increased functionality. In February 2017, we transitioned our platform from a single offering into highly-integrated offerings of multiple SKU cloud modules. We initially launched this strategy with our IT hygiene, next-generation antivirus, EDR, managed threat hunting, and intelligence modules. We currently have 19 cloud modules that span multiple large markets.
Invest in Growth. We believe that our market opportunity is large and requires us to continue to invest significantly in sales and marketing efforts to further grow our customer base, both domestically and internationally. Our open cloud architecture and single data model have allowed us to rapidly build and deploy new cloud modules, and we expect to continue investing in those efforts to further enhance our technology platform and product functionality. In addition to our ongoing investment in research and development, we may also pursue acquisitions of businesses, technologies, and assets that complement and expand the functionality of our Falcon platform, add to our technology or security expertise, or bolster our leadership position by gaining access to new customers or markets. Furthermore, we expect our general and administrative expenses to increase in dollar amount for the foreseeable future given the additional expenses for accounting, compliance, and investor relations as we grow as a public company.
Key Metrics
We monitor the following key metrics to help us evaluate our business, identify trends affecting our business, formulate business plans, and make strategic decisions.
Subscription Customers
We define a subscription customer as a separate legal entity that has entered into a distinct subscription agreement for access to Falcon platform for which the term has not ended or with which we are negotiating a renewal contract. We do not consider our channel partners as customers, and we treat managed service security providers, who may purchase our products on behalf of multiple companies, as a single customer. While initially we focused our sales and marketing efforts on large enterprises, in recent years we have also increased our sales and marketing to small and medium sized businesses.
The following table sets forth the number of our subscription customers as of the dates presented:
As of January 31,
2021 2020 2019
Subscription customers 9,896 5,431 2,516
Year-over-year growth 82 % 116 % 103 %
We added 4,465 net new subscription customers during fiscal 2021, including 64 from the acquisition of Preempt Security, for a total of 9,896 subscription customers as of January 31, 2021, representing 82% growth year-over-year.
Annual Recurring Revenue (“ARR”)
ARR is calculated as the annualized value of our customer subscription contracts as of the measurement date, assuming any contract that expires during the next 12 months is renewed on its existing terms. To the extent that we are negotiating a renewal with a customer after the expiration of the subscription, we continue to include that revenue in ARR if we are actively in discussion with such an organization for a new subscription or renewal, or until such organization notifies us that it is not renewing its subscription.
The following table sets forth our ARR as of the dates presented:
As of January 31,
2021 2020 2019
(dollars in thousands)
Annual recurring revenue $ 1,050,051 $ 600,456 $ 312,656
Year-over-year growth 75 % 92 % 121 %
ARR increased 75% year-over-year and grew to $1.1 billion as of January 31, 2021, of which $449.6 million was net new ARR added during fiscal 2021, including $6.8 million from the acquisition of Preempt Security.
Dollar-Based Net Retention Rate
Our dollar-based net retention rate compares our ARR from a set of subscription customers against the same metric for those subscription customers from the prior year. Our dollar-based net retention rate reflects customer renewals, expansion, contraction, and churn, and excludes revenue from our incident response and proactive services. We calculate our dollar-based net retention rate as of period end by starting with the ARR from all subscription customers as of 12 months prior to such period end, or Prior Period ARR. We then calculate the ARR from these same subscription customers as of the current period end, or Current Period ARR. Current Period ARR includes any expansion and is net of contraction or churn over the trailing 12 months but excludes revenue from new subscription customers in the current period. We then divide the Current Period ARR by the Prior Period ARR to arrive at our dollar-based net retention rate.
Since January 2016, our dollar-based net retention rate has consistently exceeded 100% which is primarily attributable to an expansion of endpoints within, and cross-selling additional cloud modules to, our existing subscription customers. Our dollar-based net retention rate can fluctuate from period to period due to large customer contracts in a given period, which may reduce our dollar-based net retention rate in subsequent periods if the customer makes a larger upfront purchase and does not continue to increase purchases.
As of January 31,
2021 2020 2019
Dollar-based net retention rate 125 % 124 % 147 %
Our dollar-based net retention rate has varied from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors and we expect that trend to continue. In addition, we have seen strong success with our strategy to land bigger deals with more modules, and we are also seeing an acceleration in our acquisition of new customers. While we view these two trends as positive developments, they have a natural trade off on our ability to expand business with existing customers in the near term.
Components of Our Results of Operations
Revenue
Subscription Revenue. Subscription revenue primarily consists of subscription fees for our Falcon platform and additional cloud modules that are supported by our cloud-based platform. Subscription revenue is driven primarily by the number of subscription customers, the number of endpoints per customer, and the number of cloud modules included in the subscription. We recognize subscription revenue ratably over the term of the agreement, which is generally one to three years. Because the majority of our subscription customers are billed upfront, we have recorded significant deferred revenue. Consequently, a substantial portion of the revenue that we report in each period is attributable to the recognition of deferred revenue relating to subscriptions that we entered into during previous periods. The majority of our customers are invoiced annually in advance or multi-year in advance.
Professional Services Revenue. Professional services revenue includes incident response and proactive services, forensic and malware analysis, and attribution analysis. Professional services are generally sold separately from subscriptions to our Falcon platform, although customers frequently enter into a separate arrangement to purchase subscriptions to our Falcon platform at the conclusion of a professional services arrangement. Professional services are available through hourly rate and fixed fee contracts, one-time and ongoing engagements, and retainer-based agreements. For time and materials and retainer-based arrangements, revenue is recognized as services are performed. For fixed fee contracts, we recognize revenue by applying the proportional performance method.
Cost of Revenue
Subscription Cost of Revenue. Subscription cost of revenue consists primarily of costs related to hosting our cloud-based Falcon platform in data centers, amortization of our capitalized internal-use software, employee-related costs such as salaries and bonuses, stock-based compensation expense, benefits costs associated with our operations and support personnel, software license fees, property and equipment depreciation, amortization of acquired intangibles, and an allocated portion of facilities and administrative costs.
As new customers subscribe to our platform and existing subscription customers increase the number of endpoints on our Falcon platform, our cost of revenue will increase due to greater cloud hosting costs related to powering new cloud modules and the incremental costs for storing additional data collected for such cloud modules and employee-related costs. We intend to continue to invest additional resources in our cloud platform and our customer support organizations as we grow our business. The level and timing of investment in these areas could affect our cost of revenue in the future.
Professional Services Cost of Revenue. Professional services cost of revenue consists primarily of employee-related costs, such as salaries and bonuses, stock-based compensation expense, technology, property and equipment depreciation, and an allocated portion of facilities and administrative costs.
Gross Profit and Gross Margin
Gross profit and gross margin have been and will continue to be affected by various factors, including the timing of our acquisition of new subscription customers, renewals from existing subscription customers, sales of additional modules to existing subscription customers, the data center and bandwidth costs associated with operating our cloud platform, the extent to which we expand our customer support and cloud operations organizations, and the extent to which we can increase the efficiency of our technology, infrastructure, and data centers through technological improvements. We expect our gross profit to increase in dollar amount and our gross margin to increase modestly over the long term, although our gross margin could fluctuate from period to period depending on the interplay of these factors. Demand for our incident response services is driven by the number of breaches experienced by non-customers. Also, we view our professional services solutions in the context of our larger business and as a significant lead generator for new subscriptions. Because of these factors, our services revenue and gross margin may fluctuate over time.
Operating Expenses
Our operating expenses consist of sales and marketing, research and development and general administrative expenses. For each of these categories of expense, employee-related expenses are the most significant component, which include salaries, employee bonuses, sales commissions, and employer payroll tax. Operating expenses also include an allocated portion of overhead costs for facilities and IT.
Sales and Marketing. Sales and marketing expenses primarily consist of employee-related expenses such as salaries, commissions, and bonuses. Sales and marketing expenses also include stock-based compensation; expenses related to our Fal.Con customer conference and other marketing events; an allocated portion of facilities and administrative expenses; amortization of acquired intangibles, and cloud hosting and related services costs related to proof of value efforts. We capitalize and amortize sales commissions and any other incremental payments made upon the initial acquisition of a subscription or upsells to existing customers to sales and marketing expense over the estimated customer life, and amortize any such expenses paid for the renewal of a subscription to sales and marketing expense over the term of the renewal.
We expect sales and marketing expenses to increase in dollar amount as we continue to make significant investments in our sales and marketing organization to drive additional revenue, further penetrate the market, and expand our global customer base. However, we anticipate sales and marketing expenses to decrease as a percentage of our total revenue over time, although our sales and marketing expenses may fluctuate as a percentage of our total revenue from period-to-period depending on the timing of these expenses.
Research and Development. Research and development expenses primarily consist of employee-related expenses such as salaries and bonuses; stock-based compensation, consulting expenses related to the design; development, testing, and enhancements of our subscription services; and an allocated portion of facilities and administrative expenses. Our cloud platform is software-driven, and our research and development teams employ software engineers in the design, and the related development, testing, certification, and support of these solutions.
We expect research and development expenses to increase in dollar amount as we continue to increase investments in our technology architecture and software platform. However, we anticipate research and development expenses to decrease as a percentage of our total revenue over time, although our research and development expenses may fluctuate as a percentage of our total revenue from period-to-period depending on the timing of these expenses.
General and Administrative. General and administrative expenses consist of employee-related expenses such as salaries and bonuses; stock-based compensation; and related expenses for our executive, finance, human resources, and legal organizations. In addition, general and administrative expenses include outside legal, accounting, and other professional fees; and an allocated portion of facilities and administrative expenses.
As a public company, we expect general and administrative expenses to increase in dollar amount over time. However, we anticipate general and administrative expenses to decrease as a percentage of our total revenue over time although our general and administrative expenses may fluctuate as a percentage of our total revenue from period-to-period depending on the timing of these expenses.
Interest Expense: Interest Expense consists primarily of interest expense on our secured revolving credit facility, interest expense from amortization of debt issuance costs, and contractual interest expense for our Senior Notes issued in January 2021. We expect interest expense to be higher in fiscal 2022 as a result of the issuance of our Senior Notes.
Other Income (Expense), Net. Other income (expense), net, consists primarily of income earned on our cash equivalents and marketable securities; expense related to the fair value of warrants for our redeemable convertible preferred stock and foreign currency transaction gains and losses.
Provision for Income Taxes. Provision for income taxes consists of federal and state income taxes in the United States and income taxes and withholding taxes related to customer payments in certain foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct business. We maintain a full valuation allowance on our U.S. federal and state and UK deferred tax assets that we have determined are not realizable on a more likely than not basis.

Total revenue $ 874,438 $ 481,413 $ 393,025 82 %
Total revenue increased by $393.0 million, or 82%, in fiscal 2021, compared to fiscal 2020. Subscription revenue accounted for 92% of our total revenue in fiscal 2021, and 91% in fiscal 2020. Professional services revenue accounted for 8% of our total revenue in fiscal 2021 and 9% in fiscal 2020.
Subscription revenue increased by $368.3 million, or 84%, in fiscal 2021, compared to fiscal 2020. This increase was primarily attributable to the addition of new subscription customers, as we increased our customer base by 82%, from 5,431 subscription customers in fiscal 2020 to 9,896 subscription customers in fiscal 2021. Subscription revenue from new customers, subscription revenue from the renewal of existing customers, and subscription revenue from the sale of additional endpoints and additional modules to existing customers accounted for 33%, 36%, and 31% of total subscription revenue in fiscal 2021, respectively. Subscription revenue from new customers, subscription revenue from the renewal of existing customers, and subscription revenue from the sale of additional endpoints and additional modules to existing customers accounted for 40%, 33%, and 27% of total subscription revenue in fiscal 2020, respectively.
Professional services revenue increased by $24.7 million, or 55%, in fiscal 2021, compared to fiscal 2020, and was primarily attributable to an increase in the number of professional service hours performed.

Total cost of revenue $ 229,545 $ 141,627 $ 87,918 62 %
Total cost of revenue increased by $87.9 million, or 62%, in fiscal 2021, compared to fiscal 2020. Subscription cost of revenue increased by $72.7 million, or 65%, in fiscal 2021, compared to fiscal 2020. The increase in subscription cost of revenue was primarily due to an increase in employee-related expenses of $27.6 million driven by a 74% increase in average headcount, an increase in cloud hosting and related services of $23.3 million driven by increased customer activity, an increase in depreciation of data center equipment of $7.8 million, an increase in stock-based compensation expense of $6.5 million, an increase in allocated overhead costs of $4.1 million, an increase in the amortization of internal use software of $1.6 million, and an increase in employee health insurance expense of $1.4 million, partially offset by a $1.2 million decrease in travel related costs due to the fact that, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, a majority of our workforce was working remotely and incurred limited travel costs during fiscal 2021.
Professional services cost of revenue increased by $15.2 million, or 52%, in fiscal 2021, compared to fiscal 2020. The increase in professional services cost of revenue was primarily due to an increase in employee-related expenses of $11.4 million driven by an increase in average headcount of 47% and an increase in stock-based compensation expense of $3.5 million, partially offset by a $1.1 million decrease in travel related costs due to the fact that, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, a majority of our workforce was working remotely and incurred limited travel costs during fiscal 2021.

2021 2020
Subscription gross margin 77 % 74 % 3 %
Professional services gross margin 36 % 35 % 2 %
Total gross margin 74 % 71 % 3 %
Subscription gross margin increased by 3%, in fiscal 2021, compared to fiscal 2020. This increase was a result of continuing to shift more of our operations from third-party cloud service providers to colocation data centers, renegotiating the terms of a third-party cloud service provider contract, and continued optimization of our software development and our cloud database systems, which has resulted in reduced data center usage. This increase in gross margin was also due to the continued expansion of module adoption by our customer base. As of January 31, 2021, 63% of our customer base had adopted four or more modules and 47% of our customer base had adopted five or more modules. As of January 31, 2020, 54% of our customer base had adopted four or more modules and 33% of our customer base had adopted five or more modules. Our “collect once, reuse many” data strategy means that after the first module is paid for and covers the cost of data storage and most computational costs, each additional subscription module carries a higher margin. We expect gross margin to fluctuate quarter to quarter given the timing of turning on new cloud data centers in new geographies to accommodate increased activity and demand.
Professional services gross margin increased by 2% in fiscal 2021, compared to fiscal 2020. The increase in professional services gross margin was due to an increase in utilization during fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020

Other income, net, was $6.2 million in fiscal 2021 compared to $6.7 million in fiscal 2020. This decrease of $0.5 million was driven primarily by a decrease in interest income of $6.7 million due to lower prevailing rates in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 and a decrease in income from a legal settlement of $1.3 million which occurred during fiscal 2020, partially offset by a decrease in expense related to the fair value of redeemable convertible preferred stock warrants of $6.0 million as the warrants were converted into common stock upon our IPO in June 2019 and an increase in realized gain on marketable securities of $1.3 million due to our having liquidated our portfolio of marketable securities during the first quarter of fiscal 2021 in response to the economic uncertainty surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic.

The increase in subscription cost of revenue was primarily due to an increase in employee-related payroll expenses of $17.1 million driven by a 114% increase in average headcount which included significant hiring of customer support employees, an increase in cloud hosting and related services of $10.1 million, an increase in stock-based compensation expense of $4.5 million, an increase in depreciation of data center equipment of $3.8 million, an increase in allocated overhead costs of $3.7 million, an increase in employee health insurance expense of $1.1 million, and an increase in the amortization of capitalized internal use software of $1.0 million.
Professional services cost of revenue increased by $11.1 million, or 62%, in fiscal 2020, compared to fiscal 2019. The increase in professional services cost of revenue was primarily due to an increase in employee-related payroll expenses of $6.5 million driven by an increase in average headcount of 53%, an increase in stock-based compensation of $2.3 million, an increase in allocated overhead costs of $0.9 million, and an increase in cloud hosting and related services of $0.4 million.

2020 2019
Subscription gross margin 74 % 68 % 6 %
Professional services gross margin 35 % 41 % (6) %
Total gross margin 71 % 65 % 6 %
Subscription gross margin increased by 6%, in fiscal 2020, compared to fiscal 2019. This increase was a result of moving more of our operations to co-location data centers from third-party cloud service providers and renegotiating the terms of a third-party cloud service provider contract. This increase in gross margin was also due to incentivizing our sales team to drive higher margin subscriptions and efforts to optimize our channel partner programs and the uptake of multiple cloud modules by our customer base. Our “collect once, reuse many” data strategy means that after the first module is paid for and covers the cost of data storage and most computational costs, each additional subscription module carries a higher margin. The decrease in professional services gross margin was due to a decrease in utilization in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019.

Sales and marketing expenses increased by $93.9 million, or 54%, in fiscal 2020, compared to fiscal 2019.

General and administrative expenses increased by $46.9 million, or 111%, in fiscal 2020, compared to fiscal 2019. The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to an increase in stock-based compensation expense of $26.9 million and an increase in employee-related payroll expenses of $9.9 million, driven by an increase in average general and administrative headcount of 66%. In addition, there was a $3.6 million increase in corporate insurance expense and a $1.6 million increase in allocated overhead costs.
Interest Expense and Other Income (Expense), Net
The following shows interest and other expense, net, for fiscal 2020, as compared to fiscal 2019:
Year Ended

Interest expense $ (442) $ (428) $ (14) 3 %
Other income (expense), net $ 6,725 $ (1,418) $ 8,143 (574) %
Interest expense was essentially unchanged in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 and is primarily due to the amortization of debt issuance costs on our $150.0 million loan facility which has not been drawn down.
Other income (expense), net, was an income of $6.7 million in fiscal 2020 compared to an expense of $1.4 million in fiscal 2019. This increase in other income of $8.1 million was driven primarily by an increase in interest income of $9.0 million due to increased cash balances in fiscal 2020 as a result of our IPO and income from a legal settlement of $1.3 million, partially offset by an increase in the fair value of the redeemable convertible preferred stock warrants of $2.4 million. These warrants were converted to warrants to purchase common stock in connection with our IPO.
Provision for Income Taxes

Year Ended
January 31, Change
2020 2019 $ %
(dollars in thousands)
Provision for income taxes $ 1,997 $ 1,367 $ 630 46 %
We had a provision for income taxes of $2.0 million in fiscal 2020 and a provision for income taxes of $1.4 million in fiscal 2019 resulting in an increase in income tax expense of $0.6 million. The increase was driven primarily by an increase in our international income tax expense of $1.0 million due to increased activity in several countries during fiscal 2020, partially offset by an income tax benefit of $0.4 million related to the unrealized gain on our available-for-sale securities. We maintain a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets for US federal and state and U.K. income tax purposes.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
In addition to our results determined in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, we believe the following non-GAAP measures are useful in evaluating our operating performance. We use the following non-GAAP financial information to evaluate our ongoing operations and for internal planning and forecasting purposes. We believe that non-GAAP financial measures, may be helpful to investors because such measures provide consistency and comparability with past financial performance and, when taken together with the corresponding GAAP financial measures, provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance by excluding certain items that may not be indicative of our business, results of operations, or outlook. However, non-GAAP financial information is presented for supplemental informational purposes only, has limitations as an analytical tool, and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial information presented in accordance with GAAP. In particular, free cash flow is not a substitute for cash used in operating activities. Additionally, the utility of free cash flow as a measure of our financial performance and liquidity is further limited as it does not represent the total increase or decrease in our cash balance for a given period. In addition, other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate similarly-titled non-GAAP measures differently or may use other measures to evaluate their performance, all of which could reduce the usefulness of our non-GAAP financial measures as tools for comparison. A reconciliation is provided below for each non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable financial measure stated in accordance with GAAP. Investors are encouraged to review the related GAAP financial measures and the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and not rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business.
Non-GAAP Subscription Gross Profit and Non-GAAP Subscription Gross Margin
We define non-GAAP subscription gross profit and non-GAAP subscription gross margin as GAAP subscription gross profit and GAAP subscription gross margin, respectively, excluding stock-based compensation expense and amortization of acquired intangible assets. We believe non-GAAP subscription gross profit and non-GAAP subscription gross margin provide our management and investors consistency and comparability with our past financial performance and facilitate period-to-period comparisons of operations, as these measures eliminate the effects of certain variables unrelated to our overall operating performance.
The following table presents a reconciliation of our non-GAAP subscription gross profit to our GAAP subscription gross profit and of our non-GAAP subscription gross margin to our GAAP subscription gross margin as of the periods presented:

GAAP subscription gross margin 77 % 74 % 68 %
Non-GAAP subscription gross margin 79 % 75 % 69 %
Non-GAAP Income (Loss) from Operations and Non-GAAP Operating Margin
We define non-GAAP income (loss) from operations and non-GAAP operating margin as GAAP loss from operations and GAAP operating margin, respectively, excluding stock-based compensation expense, amortization of acquired intangible assets, and acquisition-related expenses. We believe non-GAAP income (loss) from operations and non-GAAP operating margin provide our management and investors consistency and comparability with our past financial performance and facilitate period-to-period comparisons of operations, as these metrics generally eliminate the effects of certain variables unrelated to our overall operating performance.
The following table presents a reconciliation of our non-GAAP income (loss) from operations to our GAAP loss from operations and our non-GAAP operating margin to our GAAP operating margin as of the periods presented:

Free Cash Flow and Free Cash Flow Margin
Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure that we define as net cash provided by (used in) operating activities less purchases of property and equipment and capitalized internal-use software. Free cash flow margin is calculated as free cash flow divided by total revenue. We believe that free cash flow and free cash flow margin are useful indicators of liquidity that provide useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash consumed by our operating activities that is therefore not available to be used for other strategic initiatives. One limitation of free cash flow and free cash flow margin is that they do not reflect our future contractual commitments. Additionally, free cash flow does not represent the total increase or decrease in our cash balance for a given period. In addition, other companies may calculate free cash flow differently or not at all, which reduces the usefulness of free cash flow as a tool for comparison.
The following table presents a reconciliation of free cash flow and free cash flow margin to net cash provided by (used in) operating activities:

Quarterly Revenue Trends
Total revenue increased sequentially in each of the quarters presented primarily due to our addition of new customers, as well as sales of additional endpoints and modules to existing customers. We typically receive a higher percentage of our annual orders from new customers, as well as renewal orders from existing customers, in our fourth fiscal quarter as compared to other quarters due to the annual budget approval process of many of our customers. However, because we recognize revenue ratably over the term of our subscription contracts, a substantial portion of the revenue that we report in each period is attributable to orders that we received during previous periods. Consequently, increases or decreases in new sales or renewals in any one period may not be immediately reflected in our revenue for that period and may negatively affect our revenue in future periods. Accordingly, the effect of downturns in sales and market acceptance of our cloud platform, and potential changes in our rate of renewals, may not be fully reflected in our results of operations until future periods. Professional services revenue is dependent upon the number of hours performed in a quarter and can vary from period to period.
Quarterly Cost of Revenue Trends
Total cost of revenue increased sequentially in each of the quarters presented was primarily driven by an increase in employee-related expenses, cloud hosting and related expenses, depreciation of data center equipment, stock-based compensation expenses and amortization of internal-use software.
Quarterly Gross Margin Trends
The overall increase in gross margin over the course of the periods presented was primarily due to the continued expansion of module adoption by our customer base, the continuation to shift more of our operations from third-party cloud service providers to colocation data centers, renegotiating the terms of a third-party cloud service provider contract, and continued optimization of our software development and our cloud database systems, which has resulted in reduced data center usage.
Quarterly Expense Trends
Operating expenses generally have increased sequentially for each of the quarters presented, except for the three months ended October 31, 2019, primarily due to increases in employee related expenses associated with increases in our headcount to support our growth and stock-based compensation. We intend to continue to make the significant investments to support our sales and marketing related activities to acquire new customers that we believe will position the Company for future growth. We also intend to invest in research and development efforts to add new features to and enhance the functionality of our existing cloud platform, and to ensure the reliability, availability, and scalability of our solutions.
Operating expenses, particularly general and administrative expenses, increased significantly during the three months ended July 31, 2019 due to the stock-based compensation of $17.3 million related to the performance-based vesting condition for our outstanding RSUs being met during the quarter. We expect operating expenses to continue to increase for the foreseeable future.
The increase in Other income (expense), net during the three months ended October 31, 2019 was primarily driven by interest income of $4.1 million driven by the investment of the proceeds of our initial public offering. The increase in Other income (expense), net during the three months ended April 30, 2020 was due to a realized gain on the sale of marketable securities of $1.3 million, as a result of liquidating our portfolio of marketable securities in response to the economic uncertainty surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic. The decrease in Other income (expense), net during the three months ended July 31, 2020 was primarily due to a decrease in interest income of $2.8 million due to the liquidation of our portfolio of marketable securities in the prior quarter.
The increase in Interest Expense during the three months ended January 31, 2021 was primarily driven by interest and amortization of debt issuance costs related to the $750.0 million Senior Notes issued in December 2020.
The increase in the provision for income taxes during the three months ended April 30, 2020 was primarily due to income tax expense of $0.4 million related to the realized gain on the sale of marketable securities. The increase in the provision for income taxes during the three months ended January 31, 2021 was primarily due to an increase in withholding tax related to customer payments, foreign taxes in jurisdictions where we operate, and U.S. state taxes.

In January 2021, we issued and sold an aggregate principal amount of $750.0 million of 3.000% Senior Notes due 2029. The net proceeds from the debt offering were $739.6 million after deducting the underwriting commissions of $9.4 million and $1.0 million of issuance costs, which were paid as of January 31, 2021.
In January 2021, we amended and restated our existing senior secured revolving credit facility and increased the size of the credit facility from $150.0 million to $750.0 million, including a letter of credit sub-facility in the aggregate amount of $100.0 million, and a swingline sub-facility in the aggregate amount of $50.0 million. No amounts were outstanding under the credit facility as of January 31, 2021.
In June 2019, upon completion of our IPO, we received net proceeds of $659.2 million, after deducting underwriters’ discounts and commissions and offering expenses of $44.8 million.
As of January 31, 2021, we had cash and cash equivalents, consisting of highly liquid bank deposits, of $1.9 billion. During the first quarter of fiscal 2021, we liquidated our entire portfolio of marketable securities largely in response to the global economic uncertainty in conjunction with the COVID-19 pandemic. This resulted in the recognition of a realized gain of $1.3 million. We expect that our existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next 12 months.
Since our inception, we have generated operating losses, as reflected in our accumulated deficit of $730.1 million as of January 31, 2021. We expect to continue to incur operating losses for the foreseeable future due to the investments we intend to continue to make, particularly in sales and marketing and research and development. As a result, we may require additional capital resources in the future to execute strategic initiatives to grow our business.
We typically invoice our subscription customers annually in advance. Therefore, a substantial source of our cash is from such prepayments, which are included on our consolidated balance sheets as deferred revenue. Deferred revenue primarily consists of billed fees for our subscriptions, prior to satisfying the criteria for revenue recognition, which are subsequently recognized as revenue in accordance with our revenue recognition policy. As of January 31, 2021, we had deferred revenue of $911.9 million, of which $702.0 million was recorded as a current liability and is expected to be recorded as revenue in the next 12 months, provided all other revenue recognition criteria have been met.
Cash Flows
The following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods presented:
Year Ended January 31,

Net cash provided by financing activities $ 800,135 $ 706,144 $ 190,389
Operating Activities
Net cash provided by operating activities during fiscal 2021 was $356.6 million, which resulted from a net loss of $92.6 million, adjusted for non-cash charges of $263.6 million and net cash inflow of $185.6 million from changes in operating assets and liabilities. Non-cash charges primarily consisted of $149.7 million in stock-based compensation expense, $66.4 million of amortization of deferred contract acquisition costs, $38.7 million of depreciation and amortization, and $7.8 million of non-cash operating lease costs. The net cash inflow from changes in operating assets and liabilities was primarily due to a $338.8 million increase in deferred revenue, a $33.2 million increase in accrued payroll and benefits, a $23.8 million increase in accrued expenses and other current liabilities and a $11.3 million increase in accounts payable, partially offset by $151.0 million increase in deferred contract acquisition costs and a $72.5 million increase in accounts receivable.

Non-cash charges primarily consisted of $79.9 million in stock-based compensation expense, $35.5 million of amortization of deferred contract acquisition costs, $23.0 million of depreciation and amortization, and $6.0 million due to the change in the fair value of our redeemable convertible preferred stock warrant liability. The net cash inflow from changes in operating assets and liabilities was primarily due to a $280.8 million increase in deferred revenue and $17.5 million increase in accrued payroll and benefits, partially offset by a $86.6 million increase in deferred contract acquisition costs, $73.1 million increase in accounts receivable and a $43.5 million increase in prepaid expenses and other assets.
Net cash used in operating activities during fiscal 2019 was $23.0 million, which resulted from a net loss of $140.1 million, adjusted for non-cash charges of $67.8 million and net cash inflow of $49.3 million from changes in operating assets and liabilities. Non-cash charges primarily consisted of $28.6 million of amortization of deferred commissions, $20.5 million in stock-based compensation expense, $14.8 million of depreciation and amortization, and $3.6 million due to the change in the fair value of our redeemable convertible preferred stock warrant liability. The net cash inflow from changes in operating assets and liabilities was primarily due to a $131.1 million increase in deferred revenue, partially offset by a $45.1 million increase in deferred contract acquisition costs, and a $33.4 million increase in accounts receivable.
Investing Activities
Net cash provided by investing activities during fiscal 2021 of $495.4 million was primarily due to the sale of marketable securities of $639.6 million and the maturities of marketable securities of $91.6 million, partially offset by our acquisition of Preempt Security, net of cash acquired, of $85.5 million, purchases of marketable securities of $84.9 million, purchases of property and equipment of $52.8 million, and capitalized internal-use software of $10.9 million.
Net cash used in investing activities during fiscal 2020 of $629.6 million was primarily due to purchases of marketable securities of $779.7 million, purchases of property and equipment of $80.2 million, and capitalized internal-use software of $7.3 million, partially offset by maturities of marketable securities of $229.0 million and proceeds from sales of marketable securities of $9.6 million.
Net cash used in investing activities during fiscal 2019 of $142.0 million was primarily due to purchases of marketable securities of $199.3 million, purchases of property and equipment of $35.9 million, and capitalized internal-use software of $6.8 million, partially offset by maturities of marketable securities of $100.0 million.
Financing Activities
Net cash provided by financing activities of $800.1 million during fiscal 2021 was primarily due to $739.6 million related to the issuance of our Senior Notes, after deducting the underwriting commissions and issuance costs paid as of January 31, 2021, proceeds from our employee stock purchase plan of $34.3 million, and proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $28.8 million, partially offset by $3.3 million debt issuance costs related to the revolving credit facility.
Net cash provided by financing activities of $706.1 million during fiscal 2020 was primarily due to our IPO. On June 14, 2019, we closed our IPO in which we sold 20,700,000 shares of Class A common stock. The shares were sold at a public offering price of $34.00 per share for net proceeds of $665.1 million, after deducting underwriters’ discounts and commissions. In addition, there were proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $21.5 million, proceeds from issuance of common stock under the employee stock purchase plan of $12.4 million, proceeds from issuance of common stock upon exercise of early exercisable stock options of $10.3 million and $2.3 million in claims settlement under Section 16(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, partially offset by payments of deferred offering costs in the amount of $5.9 million. In December 2019, a security holder paid us $2.3 million to settle a claim under Section 16(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Section 16(b) requires certain persons and entities whose securities trading activities result in “short swing” profits to repay such profits to the issuer of the security. This payment was recorded as an increase to stockholders’ equity and as cash provided by financing activities in our consolidated statement of cash flows for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2020.
Net cash provided by financing activities of $190.4 million during fiscal 2019 was primarily due to $206.9 million in net proceeds from the issuance of our Series E redeemable convertible preferred stock, $10.0 million in proceeds from our revolving line of credit, and $3.9 million from the exercise of stock options, partially offset by a repayment on our line of credit
of $20.0 million, a repayment on our outstanding bank loan of $6.2 million, the repurchase of stock options of $2.3 million, and payments of indemnity holdback and contingent consideration of $2.1 million.
Debt Obligations
Revolving Credit Facility
In April 2019, we entered into a credit agreement with Silicon Valley Bank and other lenders, to provide a revolving line of credit of up to $150.0 million, including a letter of credit sub-facility in the aggregate amount of $10.0 million, and a swingline sub-facility in the aggregate amount of $10.0 million.
On January 4, 2021, we amended and restated our existing credit agreement (the “A&R Credit Agreement” and the facility thereunder the “Revolving Facility”) among CrowdStrike, Inc., as borrower, CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc., as guarantor, and Silicon Valley Bank and the other lenders party thereto, providing us with a revolving line of credit of up to $750.0 million, including a letter of credit sub-facility in the aggregate amount of $100.0 million, and a swingline sub-facility in the aggregate amount of $50.0 million. We also have the option to request an incremental facility of up to an additional $250.0 million from one or more of the lenders under the A&R Credit Agreement. The A&R Credit Agreement is guaranteed by all of our material domestic subsidiaries. The A&R Credit Agreement extended the maturity date of April 19, 2022 to January 2, 2026. Under the A&R Credit Agreement, revolving loans may be either Eurodollar Loans or Alternate Base Rate (“ABR”) Loans. Outstanding Eurodollar Loans incur interest at the Eurodollar Rate, which is defined as LIBOR (or any successor thereto), subject to a 0.00% LIBOR floor, plus a margin between 1.50% and 2.00%, depending on our senior secured leverage ratio. Outstanding ABR Loans incur interest at the highest of (a) the Prime Rate, as published by the Wall Street Journal, (b) the federal funds rate in effect for such day plus 0.50%, and (c) the Eurodollar Rate plus 1.00%, in each case plus a margin between (0.25%) and 0.25%, depending on the senior secured leverage ratio. We will be charged a commitment fee of 0.15% to 0.25% per year for committed but unused amounts, depending on the senior secured leverage ratio. The financial covenants require us to maintain a minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio of 3.00:1.00, a maximum senior secured leverage ratio of 3.00:1.00 (through January 31, 2023), and a maximum total leverage ratio of 5.50:1.00 stepping down to 3.50:1.00 over time. We were in compliance with the financial covenants as of January 31, 2021.
The A&R Credit Agreement is secured by substantially all of our current and future consolidated assets, property and rights, including, but not limited to, intellectual property, cash, goods, equipment, contractual rights, financial assets, and intangible assets of us and certain of our subsidiaries. The A&R Credit Agreement contains customary covenants limiting our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to, among other things, dispose of assets, undergo a change in control, merge or consolidate, make acquisitions, incur debt, incur liens, pay dividends, repurchase stock, and make investments, in each case subject to certain exceptions.
No amounts were outstanding under the A&R Credit Agreement as of January 31, 2021.
Senior Notes
On January 20, 2021, we issued $750.0 million aggregate principal amount of 3.00% Senior Notes maturing in February 2029. The Senior Notes are guaranteed by our subsidiary, CrowdStrike, Inc. and will be guaranteed by each of our existing and future domestic subsidiaries that becomes a borrower or guarantor under our A&R Credit Agreement. The Senior Notes were issued at par and bear interest at a rate of 3.00% per annum. Interest payments are payable semiannually on February 15 and August 15 of each year, commencing on August 15, 2021. We may voluntarily redeem the Senior Notes, in whole or in part, 1) at any time prior to February 15, 2024 at (a) 100.00% of their principal amount, plus a “make whole” premium or (b) with the net cash proceeds received from an equity offering at a redemption price equal to 103.00% of the principal amount, provided the aggregate principal amount of all such redemptions does not exceed 40% of the original aggregate principal amount of the Senior Notes; 2) at any time on or after February 15, 2024 at a prepayment price equal to 101.50% of the principal amount; 3) at any time on or after February 15, 2025 at a prepayment price equal to 100.75% of the principal amount; and 4) at any time on or after February 15, 2026 at a prepayment price equal to 100.00% of the principal amount; in each case, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to but excluding, the date of redemption.
The net proceeds from the debt offering were $739.6 million after deducting the underwriting commissions of $9.4 million and $1.0 million of issuance costs, which were paid as of January 31, 2021. An additional $1.6 million of issuance costs are expected to be paid in the first quarter of fiscal 2022. Debt issuance costs of $2.6 million are being amortized to interest
expense using the effective interest method over the term of the Senior Notes. Interest expense related to contractual interest expense and amortization of debt issuance costs was $0.7 million and $0.1 million, respectively, during the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021.
In certain circumstances involving change of control events, we will be required to make an offer to repurchase all or, at the holder’s option, any part, of each holder’s Senior Notes at 101% of the aggregate principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the repurchase date.
The indenture governing the Senior Notes (the “Indenture”) contain covenants limiting our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to create liens on certain assets to secure debt; grant a subsidiary guarantee of certain debt without also providing a guarantee of the Senior Notes; and consolidate or merge with or into, or sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets to, another person. These covenants are subject to a number of important limitations and exceptions. Certain of these covenants will not apply during any period in which the notes are rated investment grade by two of Fitch Ratings, Inc., Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. and Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services.
As of January 31, 2021, we were in compliance with all of our financial covenants under the Indenture associated with the Senior Notes.
Supplemental Guarantor Financial Information
Our Senior Notes are guaranteed on a senior, unsecured basis by CrowdStrike, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (the “subsidiary guarantor,” and together with CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc., the “Obligor Group”). The guarantee is full and unconditional, and is subject to certain conditions for release. For a brief description of the Senior Notes, see the section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K titled “Liquidity and Capital Resources-Senior Notes.”
The Company conducts its operations almost entirely through its subsidiaries. Accordingly, the Obligor Group’s cash flow and ability to service the notes will depend on the earnings of the Company’s subsidiaries and the distribution of those earnings to the Obligor Group, whether by dividends, loans or otherwise. Holders of the guaranteed registered debt securities will have a direct claim only against the Obligor Group.
Summarized financial information is presented below for the Obligor Group on a combined basis after elimination of intercompany transactions and balances within the Obligor Group and equity in the earnings from and investments in any non-guarantor subsidiary. The summarized financial information of the Obligor Group also includes the amounts of Crowdstrike Services, Inc. which was a separate wholly owned subsidiary of the Company that was merged into Crowdstrike, Inc. on December 31, 2020, therefore becoming part of the Obligor Group prior to the issuance of the Senior Notes. The revenue amounts presented in the summarized financial information include substantially all of the Company’s consolidated revenues, and there are no intercompany revenues from the non-guarantor subsidiaries. This summarized financial information has been prepared and presented pursuant to Regulation S-X Rule 13-01, “Financial Disclosures about Guarantors and Issuers of Guaranteed Securities” and is not intended to present the financial position or results of operations of the Obligor Group in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

Strategic Investments
In July 2019, we agreed to commit up to $10.0 million to a newly formed entity, CrowdStrike Falcon Fund LLC (“Falcon Fund”), in exchange for 50% of the sharing percentage of any distribution by Falcon Fund. Additionally, entities associated with Accel, a holder of more than 5% of our capital stock, also agreed to commit up to $10.0 million to Falcon Fund and collectively own the remaining 50% of the sharing percentage of Falcon Fund. Falcon Fund is in the business of purchasing, selling, investing and trading in minority equity and convertible debt securities of privately-held companies that develop applications that have potential for substantial contribution to CrowdStrike and its platform. Falcon Fund has a duration of ten years which may be extended for three additional years. At dissolution, Falcon Fund will be liquidated and the remaining assets will be distributed to the investors based on their sharing percentage. We have made contributions to Falcon Fund totaling $1.3 million as of January 31, 2021.

(2)Relates to non-cancelable commitments to data center vendors.
(3)Relates to non-cancelable purchase commitments with various parties to purchase products and services entered into in the normal course of business.
(4)Relates to $750.0 million aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes due in fiscal 2030.
(5)Relates to the interest payments associated with the Senior Notes based on the principal amount multiplied by the applicable interest rate. The interest payment under the Revolving Credit Facility for the undrawn balance is payable at 15 bps as a commitment fee based on the daily undrawn balance and we utilized the existing rate for the projected interest payments included in the table above. For additional information refer to Note 5, Debt, of our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
The contractual commitment amounts in the table above are associated with agreements that are enforceable and legally binding. Obligations under contracts, including purchase orders, that we can cancel without a significant penalty are not included in the table above. Purchase orders issued in the ordinary course of business are not included in the table above, as such purchase orders represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements.
Indemnification
Our subscription agreements contain standard indemnification obligations. Pursuant to these agreements, we will indemnify, defend, and hold the other party harmless with respect to a claim, suit, or proceeding brought against the other party by a third party alleging that our intellectual property infringes upon the intellectual property of the third party, or results from a breach of our representations and warranties or covenants, or that results from any acts of negligence or willful misconduct. The term of these indemnification agreements is generally perpetual any time after the execution of the agreement. Typically, these indemnification provisions do not provide for a maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make. However, in the past we have not been obligated to make significant payments for these obligations and no liabilities have been recorded for these obligations on our consolidated balance sheets as of January 31, 2021 or January 31, 2020.
We also agreed to indemnify our directors and certain executive officers for certain events or occurrences, subject to certain limits, while the officer is or was serving at our request in such capacity. The maximum amount of potential future indemnification is unlimited. However, our director and officer insurance policy limits our exposure and enables us to recover a portion of any future amounts paid. Historically, we have not been obligated to make any payments for these obligations and no liabilities have been recorded for these obligations on our consolidated balance sheets as of January 31, 2021 or January 31, 2020.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We do not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities. We do not have any outstanding derivative financial instruments, off-balance sheet guarantees, interest rate swap transactions, or foreign currency forward contracts.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Our management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our financial statements and notes to our financial statements, which were prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of the financial statements requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Our management evaluates our estimates on an ongoing basis, including those related to the allowance for doubtful accounts, the carrying value and useful lives of long-lived assets, the fair value of financial instruments, the recognition and disclosure of contingent liabilities, income taxes, and stock-based compensation. We base our estimates and judgments on our historical experience, knowledge of factors affecting our business and our belief as to what could occur in the future considering available information and assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
The accounting estimates we use in the preparation of our financial statements will change as new events occur, more experience is acquired, additional information is obtained and our operating environment changes. Changes in estimates are made when circumstances warrant. Such changes in estimates and refinements in estimation methodologies are reflected in our reported results of operations and, if material, the effects of changes in estimates are disclosed in the notes to our financial statements. By their nature, these estimates and judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty and actual results could differ materially from the amounts reported based on these estimates.
The critical accounting estimates, assumptions and judgments that we believe have the most significant impact on our consolidated financial statements are described below.
Revenue Recognition
We adopted ASC 606 on February 1, 2019, using the modified retrospective transition method. Under this method, results for reporting periods beginning on February 1, 2019 are presented under Topic 606, while prior period amounts are not adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with prior accounting under Topic 605.
In accordance with ASC 606, revenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of promised services. The amount of revenue recognized reflects the consideration that we expect to be entitled to receive in exchange for these services. To achieve the core principle of this standard, we apply the following five steps:
(1)Identify the contract with a customer
We consider the terms and conditions of contracts with customers and our customary business practices in identifying contracts under ASC 606. We determine we have a contract with a customer when the contract is approved, each party’s rights regarding the services to be transferred can be identified, payment terms for the services can be identified, we have determined that the customer has the ability and intent to pay, and the contract has commercial substance. We apply judgment in determining the customer’s ability and intent to pay, which is based on a variety of factors, including the customer’s historical payment experience or, in the case of a new customer, credit and financial information pertaining to the customer.
(2)Identify the performance obligations in the contract
Performance obligations promised in a contract are identified based on the services that will be transferred to the customer that are both capable of being distinct, whereby the customer can benefit from the service either on its own or together with other resources that are readily available from us or from third parties, and are distinct in the context of the contract, whereby the transfer of the services is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract. Our performance obligations consist of (i) subscriptions and (ii) professional services.
(3)Determine the transaction price
The transaction price is determined based on the consideration which we are expected to be entitled to in exchange for transferring services to the customer. Variable consideration is included in the transaction price if it is probable that a significant future reversal of cumulative revenue under the contract will not occur. None of our contracts contain a significant financing component.
(4)Allocate the transaction price to performance obligations in the contract
If the contract contains a single performance obligation, the entire transaction price is allocated to the single performance obligation. Contracts that contain multiple performance obligations require an allocation of the transaction price to each performance obligation based on a relative standalone selling price (“SSP”).
(5)Recognize revenue when or as performance obligations are satisfied
Revenue is recognized at the time the related performance obligation is satisfied by transferring the promised service to the customer. Revenue is recognized when control of the services is transferred to the customer, in an amount that reflects the consideration expected to be received in exchange for those services. We generate all our revenue from contracts with customers.
Subscription Revenue
Our Falcon Platform technology solutions are subscription, SaaS offerings designed to continuously monitor, share, and mitigate risks from determined attackers. Customers do not have the right to take possession of the cloud-based software platform. Fees are based on several factors, including the solutions subscribed for by the customer and the number of endpoints purchased by the customer. The subscription fees are typically payable within 30 to 60 days after the execution of the arrangement, and thereafter upon renewal or subsequent installment. We initially record the subscription fees as deferred revenue and recognizes revenue on a straight-line basis over the term of the agreement.
The typical subscription term is one to three years. Most of our contracts are non-cancelable over the contractual term. Customers typically have the right to terminate their contracts for cause if we fail to perform in accordance with the contractual terms. Some customers have the option to purchase additional subscription at a stated price. These options generally do not provide a material right as they are priced at our SSP.
Professional Services Revenue
We offer several types of professional services including incident response and forensic services, surge forensic and malware analysis, and attribution analysis, which are focused on responding to imminent and direct threats, assessing vulnerabilities, and recommending solutions. These services are distinct from subscription services. Professional services do not result in significant customization of the subscription service. The professional services are available through hourly rate and fixed fee contracts, one-time and ongoing engagements, and retainer-based agreements. Revenue for time and materials arrangements is recognized as services are performed and revenue for fixed fees is recognized on a proportional performance basis as the services are performed.
Contracts with Multiple Performance Obligations
Some contracts with customers contain multiple promised services consisting of subscription and professional services that are distinct and accounted for separately. The transaction price is allocated to the separate performance obligations on a relative SSP basis. The SSP is the price at which we would sell promised subscription or professional services separately to a customer. Judgment is required to determine the SSP for each distinct performance obligation. We determine SSP based on our overall pricing objectives, taking into consideration the type of subscription or professional service and the number of endpoints.
Variable Consideration
Revenue from sales is recorded at the net sales price, which is the transaction price, and includes estimates of variable consideration. The amount of variable consideration that is included in the transaction price is constrained and is included in the net sales price only to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of the cumulative revenue will not occur when the uncertainty is resolved.
If subscriptions do not meet certain service level commitments, our customers are entitled to receive service credits, and in certain cases, refunds, each representing a form of variable consideration. We have historically not experienced any significant incidents affecting the defined levels of reliability and performance as required by our subscription contracts. Accordingly, any estimated refunds related to these agreements in the consolidated financial statements is not material during the periods presented.
We provide rebates and other credits within our contracts with certain resellers, which are estimated based on the most likely amounts expected to be earned or claimed on the related sales transaction. Overall, the transaction price is reduced to reflect our estimate of the amount of consideration to which we are entitled based on the terms of the contract. Estimated rebates and other credits were not material during the periods presented.
Stock-Based Compensation
We account accounts for stock-based awards granted to employees and directors based on the awards’ estimated grant date fair value. We estimate the fair value of our stock options using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The resulting fair value is recognized on a straight-line basis over the period during which the employee or director is required to provide service in exchange for the award, usually the vesting period, which is generally four years. We account for forfeitures as they occur.
Restricted stock units (“RSUs”) granted under the 2011 Plan are subject to a service-based vesting condition and a performance-based vesting condition. The service-based vesting condition is generally satisfied based on one of three vesting schedules: (i) vesting of one-fourth of the RSUs on the first “Company vest date” (defined as March 20, June 20, September 20, or December 20) on or following the one-year anniversary of the vesting commencement date with the remainder of the RSUs vesting in twelve equal quarterly installments thereafter, subject to continued service, (ii) vesting in sixteen equal quarterly installments beginning on December 20, 2018, subject to continued service, or (iii) vesting in eight equal quarterly installments beginning on December 20, 2022, subject to continued service. The performance-based vesting condition is satisfied on the
earlier of (i) a change in control, in which the consideration paid to holders of shares is either cash, publicly traded securities, or a combination thereof, or (ii) the first Company vest date to occur following the expiration of the lock-up period upon an IPO, subject to continued service through such change in control or lock-up expiration, as applicable. None of the RSUs vest unless the performance-based vesting condition is satisfied. Upon the completion of the IPO, the performance-based vesting condition was met and we recognized $17.3 million of deferred expense related to RSUs as of that date in its consolidated statement of operations. Upon our IPO, we began issuing RSUs to our employees and these RSUs generally have only a service condition. The service-based vesting condition is generally with a vesting term of four years. The valuation of such RSUs is based solely on the fair value of our stock price on the date of grant. Expense for RSUs that have a service-based condition only are being amortized on a straight-line basis.
Performance-based stock units (“PSUs”) granted under the 2019 Plan are subject to a performance-based vesting condition. With regard to the performance conditions, the fair value of new or modified awards is equal to the grant date fair market value of our common stock. PSUs generally vest over a four-year period based on the achievement of specified performance targets and subject to continued service through the applicable vesting dates. The compensation cost is recognized over the requisite service period when it is probable that the performance condition will be satisfied.
Business Combinations
We allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. Such valuations require management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. Significant estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include, but are not limited to, future expected cash flows from acquired users, acquired technology, trade names from a market participant perspective, useful lives and discount rates. Management’s estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from estimates. During the measurement period, which is one year from the acquisition date, we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period, any subsequent adjustments are recorded in the consolidated statement of operations.
Strategic Investments
In July 2019, we agreed to commit up to $10.0 million to a newly formed entity, CrowdStrike Falcon Fund LLC (“Falcon Fund”) in exchange for 50% of the sharing percentage of any distribution by Falcon Fund. Entities associated with Accel, a holder of more than 5% of the our capital stock, also agreed to commit up to $10.0 million to Falcon Fund, and collectively own the remaining 50% of the sharing percentage of Falcon Fund. Falcon Fund is in the business of purchasing, selling, investing and trading in minority equity and convertible debt securities of privately-held companies that develop applications that have potential for substantial contribution to CrowdStrike and its platform. We are the manager of the Falcon Fund and control the investment decisions and day-to-day operations and accordingly consolidate the Falcon Fund. Falcon Fund has a duration of ten years and may be extended for three additional years. At dissolution, Falcon Fund will be liquidated and the remaining assets will be distributed to the investors based on their respective sharing percentage. We have made contributions to Falcon Fund totaling $1.3 million as of January 31, 2021.
We have elected the measurement alternative for the non-marketable equity investments of the Falcon Fund where eligible. Under the measurement alternative, the equity investments are measured at cost, less any impairment, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer. The non-marketable equity investments of the Falcon Fund are valued using significant unobservable inputs or data in inactive markets which requires judgment due to the absence of market prices and inherent lack of liquidity. As a result, there could be volatility in our consolidated statements of operations in future periods due to the valuation and timing of identical or similar investments of the same issuer.
Income Taxes
We account for income taxes using the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities and net operating loss and credit carryforwards using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized.
We account for unrecognized tax benefits using a more-likely-than-not threshold for financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. We establish a liability for tax-related uncertainties based on estimates of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. We record an income tax liability, if any, for the difference between the benefit recognized and measured and the tax position taken or expected to be taken on our tax returns. To the extent that the assessment of such tax positions changes, the change in estimate is recorded in the period in which the determination is made. The liability is adjusted considering changing facts and circumstances, such as the outcome of a tax audit. The provision for income taxes includes the impact of liability provisions and changes to the liability that are considered appropriate. We maintain a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets in the United States and the U.K., the changes resulted in no material tax expense during the year ended January 31, 2021. We do not expect that changes in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits for the next twelve months will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
Operating Leases
We enter into operating lease arrangements for real estate assets related to office space. We determine if an arrangement is or contains a lease at inception by evaluating various factors, including whether a vendor’s right to substitute an identified asset is substantive. Lease classification is determined at the lease commencement date, which is the date the leased assets are made available for use. Operating leases are included in “Operating lease right-of-use assets”, “Operating lease liabilities, current”, and “Operating lease liabilities, noncurrent” in the consolidated balance sheets. We did not have any financing leases in any of the periods presented.
Operating lease right-of-use assets and lease liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. Lease payments consist of the fixed payments under the arrangement, less any lease incentives, such as tenant improvement allowances. Variable costs, such as maintenance and utilities based on actual usage, are not included in the measurement of right-to-use assets and lease liabilities but are expensed when the event determining the amount of variable consideration to be paid occurs. As the implicit rate of the leases is not determinable, we use an incremental borrowing rate (“IBR”) based on the information available at the lease commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. Lease expenses are recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
We use the non-cancelable lease term when recognizing the right-of-use (“ROU”) assets and lease liabilities, unless it is reasonably certain that a renewal or termination option will be exercised. We account for lease components and non-lease components as a single lease component.
Leases with a term of twelve months or less are not recognized on the consolidated balance sheets but are recognized as expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
JOBS Act Accounting Election
On the last business day of our second quarter in fiscal 2021, the aggregate market value of our shares held by non-affiliate stockholders exceeded $700 million. As a result, as of January 31, 2021, we are considered a large accelerated filer as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, and we ceased to be an emerging growth company as defined in the JOBS Act.
Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements
See Note 2, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies”, of our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information about the impact of certain recent accounting pronouncements on our consolidated financial statements.","Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
We have operations in the United States and internationally, and we are exposed to market risk in the ordinary course of business.
Interest Rate Risk
Our cash and cash equivalents primarily consist of cash on hand and highly liquid investments in corporate debt securities and bank deposits. Our investments are exposed to market risk due to fluctuations in interest rates, which may affect our interest income and the fair value of our investments. As of January 31, 2021, we had cash and cash equivalents of $1.9 billion and no marketable securities. The carrying amount of our cash equivalents reasonably approximates fair value due to the short maturities of these instruments. The primary objectives of our investment activities are the preservation of capital, the fulfillment of liquidity needs, and the fiduciary control of cash and investments. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes. Due to the short-term nature of our investment portfolio, the effect of a hypothetical 100 basis point change in interest rates would not have had a material effect on the fair market value of our portfolio as of January 31, 2021. We therefore do not expect our results of operations or cash flows to be materially affected by a sudden change in market interest rates.
Our debt obligations consist of variety of financial instruments that expose us to interest rate risk, including, but not limited to our revolving credit facility and the Senior Notes. Interest on the revolving credit facility is tied to short term interest rate benchmarks including prime rate or LIBOR. Interest on the term loans is fixed.
Foreign Currency Risk
To date, nearly all of our sales contracts have been denominated in U.S. dollars. A portion of our operating expenses are incurred outside the United States, denominated in foreign currencies and subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly changes in the British Pound, Australian Dollar, and Euro. The functional currency of our foreign subsidiaries is that country’s local currency. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are recorded to Other income (expense), net. During the year ended January 31, 2021, foreign currency exchange rate gain recorded to Other comprehensive income (loss) was $2.6 million. A hypothetical 10% decrease in the U.S. dollar against other currencies would have resulted in an increase in operating loss of approximately $17.2 million for the year ended January 31, 2021. We have not entered into derivative or hedging transactions, but we may do so in the future if our exposure to foreign currency becomes more significant.","Item 8.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc.
Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of January 31, 2021 and 2020, and the related consolidated statements of operations, of comprehensive loss, of redeemable convertible preferred stock and stockholders’ equity (deficit) and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended January 31, 2021, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of January 31, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended January 31, 2021 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.
Changes in Accounting Principles
As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts for leases in 2021 and the manner in which it accounts for revenues from contracts with customers in 2020.
Basis for Opinions
The Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures
that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Critical Audit Matters
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.
Revenue Recognition - Identification and Evaluation of Terms and Conditions in Contracts
As described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company generates its revenue from contracts with customers for subscriptions and professional services. Management considers the terms and conditions of contracts with customers and the Company’s customary business practices in identifying contracts. Management determines the Company has a contract with a customer when the contract is approved, each party’s rights regarding the services to be transferred can be identified, payment terms for the services can be identified, it has been determined that the customer has the ability and intent to pay, and the contract has commercial substance. Revenue is recognized when control of the promised services is transferred to the customer, in an amount that reflects the consideration expected to be received in exchange for those services. The Company’s consolidated revenue for the year ended January 31, 2021 was $874 million.
The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to revenue recognition, specifically the identification and evaluation of terms and conditions in contracts, is a critical audit matter are the high degree of auditor subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and evaluating evidence relating to the identification and evaluation of terms and conditions in contracts.
Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the revenue recognition process, including controls over the identification and evaluation of terms and conditions in contracts. These procedures also included, among others, (i) testing management’s process for identifying and evaluating terms and conditions in contracts, including evaluating management’s determination of the impact of those terms and conditions on revenue recognition, and (ii) testing the completeness and accuracy of management’s identification and evaluation of terms and conditions in contracts by examining revenue transactions on a test basis.

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Principles of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported and disclosed in the Company’s consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. These estimates are based on information available as of the date of the consolidated financial statements. On a regular basis, management evaluates these estimates and assumptions. Actual results may differ from these estimates and such difference could be material to the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
Estimates and assumptions used by management include, but are not limited to, revenue recognition, the allowance for doubtful accounts, the carrying value and the useful lives of long-lived assets, the fair values of financial instruments and strategic investments, the period of benefit for deferred contract acquisition costs, the discount rate used for operating leases, the recognition and disclosure of contingent liabilities, income taxes, stock-based compensation, the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed for business combinations, and the accounting for the Senior Notes.
CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
Due to the Coronavirus (“COVID-19”) pandemic, there has been uncertainty and disruption in the global economy and financial markets. The Company is not aware of any specific event or circumstance that would require a material update to its estimates or judgments or an adjustment of the carrying value of its assets or liabilities as of January 31, 2021. While there was not a material impact to the Company’s consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended January 31, 2021, these estimates may change, as new events occur and additional information is obtained, as well as other factors related to COVID-19 that could result in material impacts to the Company’s consolidated financial statements in future reporting periods.
Concentration of Credit Risk and Geographic Information
The Company generates revenue from the sale of subscriptions to access its cloud platform and professional services. The Company’s sales team, along with its channel partner network of system integrators and value-added resellers (collectively, “channel partners”), sells the Company’s services worldwide to organizations of all sizes.
Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist of cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, accounts receivable, and strategic investments. The Company’s cash is placed with high-credit-quality financial institutions and issuers, and at times exceed federally insured limits. The Company limits its concentration of risk in cash equivalents and marketable securities by diversifying its investments among a variety of industries and issuers. The Company has not experienced any credit loss relating to its cash equivalents, marketable securities, and strategic investments. The Company performs periodic credit evaluations of its customers and generally does not require collateral. As of January 31, 2021, the Company did not have any cash equivalents or marketable securities.
Channel partners or direct customers who represented 10% or more of the Company’s accounts receivable were as follows:
January 31,
2021 2020
Channel partner A 6 % 11 %
Channel partner B 4 % 10 %
Channel partner C(1)
10 % 3 %
Customer A(1)
17 % 17 %
______________________________
(1)Channel Partner C and Customer A are controlled by the same Company.
Channel partners who represented 10% or more of the Company’s total revenue were as follows:
Year Ended January 31,
2021 2020 2019
Channel partner A 8 % 10 % 15 %
There were no direct customers who represented 10% or more of the Company’s total revenue during the years ended January 31, 2021, January 31, 2020, and January 31, 2019.
Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities
The Company considers all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less at date of purchase to be cash equivalents. As of January 31, 2021, the Company did not have any cash equivalents or marketable securities. Cash equivalents as of January 31, 2020 consisted of corporate debt securities and money market funds stated at fair value. The Company classifies investments in marketable securities as available-for-sale securities at the time of purchase and re-evaluates the designations as of each balance sheet date. The Company classifies its available-for-sale securities as short-term investments based on their nature and their availability for use in current operations. Available-for-sale securities are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses, if any, included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Unrealized losses are recorded in Other income (expense), net, for declines in fair value below the cost of an individual investment that is deemed to be other-than-temporary. The Company did not identify any marketable securities as other-than-temporarily impaired as of January 31, 2020. The Company determines realized gains or losses on the sale of marketable securities on a specific identification method and records such gains or losses in Other income (expense), net. Marketable securities as of January 31, 2020 consisted of corporate debt securities and U.S. treasury securities.
CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
Strategic Investments
In July 2019, the Company agreed to commit up to $10.0 million to a newly formed entity, CrowdStrike Falcon Fund LLC (“Falcon Fund”) in exchange for 50% of the sharing percentage of any distribution by Falcon Fund. Additionally, entities associated with Accel, a holder of more than 5% of the Company’s capital stock, also agreed to commit up to $10.0 million to Falcon Fund, and collectively own the remaining 50% of the sharing percentage of Falcon Fund. Falcon Fund is in the business of purchasing, selling and investing in minority equity and convertible debt securities of privately-held companies that develop applications that have potential for substantial contribution to CrowdStrike and its platform. The Company is the manager of the Falcon Fund and controls the investment decisions and day-to-day operations and accordingly has consolidated the Falcon Fund. Falcon Fund has a duration of ten years and may be extended for three additional years. At dissolution, Falcon Fund will be liquidated and the remaining assets will be distributed to the investors based on their respective sharing percentage. The Company has made contributions to Falcon Fund totaling $1.3 million as of January 31, 2021.
The Company has elected the measurement alternative for the non-marketable equity investments of the Falcon Fund where eligible. Under the measurement alternative, the carrying value of the strategic investments is adjusted to fair value for observable transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer or impairment. All gains and losses on strategic investments, realized and unrealized, are recognized in Other income (expense), net. Strategic investments are classified within Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy when a remeasurement occurs based on price changes from observable transactions of identical or similar securities of the same issuer or for impairment. The fair value is estimated based on valuation methods using the observable transaction price at the transaction date and other unobservable inputs including volatility, rights, and obligations of the investments. The Company classifies the investments in Falcon Fund as a non-current asset called Strategic Investments on the consolidated balance sheets as of January 31, 2021. There have been no realized or unrealized gains or losses on the strategic investments during the year ended January 31, 2021.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The Company’s financial instruments consist of cash equivalents, marketable securities, strategic investments, accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued expenses, the redeemable convertible preferred stock warrant liability, and the Senior Notes. The carrying values of cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and accrued expenses approximate fair value due to their short-term nature. The Senior Notes are carried at the initially allocated liability value less unamortized debt discount and issuance costs on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet. The Company discloses the fair value of the Senior Notes at each reporting period for disclosure purposes only. Refer to Note 3, Fair Value Measurements and Marketable Securities, regarding the fair value of the Company’s marketable securities and non-marketable securities and Note 5, Debt, for the fair value of the Company’s Senior Notes.
The Company reports the redeemable convertible preferred stock warrant liability at fair value (see Note 3, Fair Value Measurements). The warrants issued by the Company for redeemable convertible preferred stock in January 2015, December 2016, and March 2017 (see Note 7, Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock) have been recorded as a liability based on “Level 3” inputs, which consist of unobservable inputs and reflect management’s estimates of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the liability. The fair value of the warrants was determined using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which is affected by changes in inputs to that model including the Company’s stock price, expected stock price volatility, risk-free rate, and contractual term. Immediately prior to the closing of the IPO on June 14, 2019, the redeemable convertible preferred stock warrants converted into 336,386 warrants to purchase Class B common stock on a one-to-one basis. The redeemable convertible preferred stock warrant liability was reclassified to additional paid-in capital upon the closing of the IPO.
Accounts Receivable
Accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and are non-interest bearing. Accounts receivable are stated at their net realizable value, net of allowance for doubtful accounts. The Company has a well-established collections history from its customers. Credit is extended to customers based on an evaluation of their financial condition and other factors. The Company generally does not require collateral from its customers; however, the Company may require payment prior to commencing service in certain instances to limit credit risk. The Company regularly reviews the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts by considering various factors including the age of each outstanding invoice, each customer’s expected ability to pay, historical loss rates and expectations of forward-looking loss estimates to determine whether the allowance is
CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
appropriate. Amounts deemed uncollectible are written off against the allowance for doubtful accounts. As of January 31, 2021 and January 31, 2020, the allowance for doubtful accounts was $1.2 million and $1.1 million, respectively.
Software Implementation Costs
The Company contracts with third party information technology providers for various service arrangements including software, platform, and information technology infrastructure. The Company capitalizes the implementation cost incurred to develop or obtain internal-use software in such arrangements and are recorded as part of property and equipment, net in the consolidated balance sheets. All capitalized implementation costs are amortized over the term of the arrangement which includes reasonably certain renewals. Costs incurred during the preliminary project and post implement stage are expensed as the activities are performed. Capitalized implementation costs was $0.3 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021.
Deferred Offering Costs
Deferred offering costs consisted of fees and expenses incurred in connection with the sale of the Company's common stock in an IPO, including legal, accounting, printing and other IPO-related costs. Upon the close of the IPO on June 14, 2019, total deferred offering costs of $5.9 million were reclassified to stockholders’ equity and recorded against the proceeds from the offering.
Property and Equipment, Net
Property and equipment, net, is stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization are calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets as follows:
Data center and other computer equipment 3 - 5 years
Furniture and equipment 5 years
Purchased software 3 - 5 years
Capitalized internal-use software and website development 3 years
Leasehold improvements Estimated useful life or term of the lease, whichever is shorter
Expenditures for routine maintenance and repairs are charged to operating expense as incurred. Major renewals and improvements are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives. Upon retirement or other disposition of property and equipment, the cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts, and any gain or loss is recorded in operating expenses in the consolidated statement of operations.
Capitalized Internal-Use Software
The Company capitalizes certain development costs incurred in connection with its internal-use software. These capitalized costs are primarily related to the Company’s cloud-delivered solution for next-generation endpoint protection. Costs incurred in the preliminary stages of development are expensed as incurred. Once an application has reached the development stage, internal and external costs, if direct, are capitalized until the software is substantially complete and ready for its intended use.
Capitalization ceases upon completion of all substantial testing. The Company also capitalizes costs related to specific upgrades and enhancements when it is probable the expenditures will result in additional functionality. Capitalized costs are recorded as property and equipment, net. Maintenance and training costs are expensed as incurred. Internal-use software is amortized to cost of revenue on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful life of three years. Management evaluates the useful lives of these assets on an annual basis and tests for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances occur that could impact the recoverability of these assets.
Intangible Assets, Net
Intangible assets, net, consisting of developed technology, customer relationships, and other acquired intangibles, are stated at cost less accumulated amortization. All intangible assets have been determined to have definite lives and are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated economic lives, which are generally one to five years. Amortization expense related to developed technology is included in cost of revenue, amortization expense related to customer relationships is included in sales
CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
and marketing expenses, and amortization expense related to other acquired intangibles is included in research and development expenses.
Deferred Contract Acquisition Costs
Prior to the adoption of ASC606, sales commissions associated with the Falcon platform were amortized over the contract term and sales commissions associated with professional service contracts were expensed as incurred. Under ASC 606, the Company capitalizes contract acquisition costs that are incremental to the acquisition of customer contracts. Contract acquisition costs are accrued and capitalized upon execution of the sales contract by the customer. Sales commissions for renewal of a contract are not considered commensurate with the commissions paid for the acquisition of the initial contract or follow-on upsell given the substantive difference in commission rates in proportion to their respective contract values. Commissions, including referral fees paid to channel partners, earned upon the initial acquisition of a contract or subsequent upsell are amortized over an estimated period of benefit of four years while commissions earned for renewal contracts are amortized over the contractual term of the renewals. Sales commissions associated with professional service contract are amortized ratably over an estimated period of benefit of six months. The Company capitalized contract acquisition costs of $151.0 million and $86.6 million during the years ended January 31, 2021 and January 31, 2020, respectively. Contract acquisition cost amortization expense was $66.4 million and $35.5 million under ASC 606 during the year ended January 31, 2021 and January 31, 2020, respectively. Contract acquisition cost amortization expense was $28.6 million under ASC 605, during the year ended January 31, 2019.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
The Company reviews for impairment of long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset (or asset group) may not be recoverable. Events and changes in circumstances considered by the Company in determining whether the carrying value of long-lived assets may not be recoverable, include, but are not limited to: significant changes in performance relative to expected operating results, significant changes in the use of the assets, significant negative industry or economic trends, and changes in the Company’s business strategy. Impairment testing is performed at an asset level that represents the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities (an “asset group”). An impairment loss would be recognized when estimated future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset (or asset group) and its eventual disposition is less than its carrying amount. No impairment indicators were identified by the Company and no impairment losses were recorded by the Company during the years ended January 31, 2021, January 31, 2020, and January 31, 2019.
Deferred Revenue
The deferred revenue balance consists of subscription and professional services which have been invoiced upfront and are recognized as revenue only when the revenue recognition criteria are met. The Company’s subscription contracts are typically invoiced to its customers at the beginning of the term, or in some instances, such as in multi-year arrangements, in installments. Professional services are either invoiced upfront, invoiced in installments, or invoiced as the services are performed. Accordingly, the Company’s deferred revenue balance does not include revenues for future years of multi-year non-cancellable contracts that have not yet been billed.
The Company recognizes subscription revenue ratably over the contract term beginning on the commencement date of each contract, the date that services are made available to customers. The Company recognizes professional services revenue as services are delivered. Once services are available to customers, the Company records amounts due in accounts receivable and in deferred revenue. To the extent the Company bills customers in advance of the contract commencement date, the accounts receivable and corresponding deferred revenue amounts are netted to zero on the consolidated balance sheets, unless such amounts have been paid as of the balance sheet date.
Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock Warrants
Warrants related to the Company’s redeemable convertible preferred stock are classified as liabilities on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. The warrants are subject to reassessment at each balance sheet date, and any change in fair value is recognized as a component of Other income (expense), net, in the consolidated statements of operations. The Company will continue to adjust the liability for changes in fair value until the earlier of the expiration or exercise of the warrants, or upon their automatic conversion into warrants to purchase common stock in connection with a qualified initial public offering (as
CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
defined in Note 7, Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock) such that they qualify for equity classification and no further remeasurement is required.
Immediately prior to the closing of the IPO on June 14, 2019, the redeemable convertible preferred stock warrants converted into 336,386 warrants to purchase Class B common stock on a one-to-one basis. The redeemable convertible preferred stock warrant liability was reclassified to additional paid-in capital. Within the same month, the Company received notice from the holders of 336,386 warrants as to their intentions to exercise the warrants for shares of common stock of the Company. Such shares were settled via net settlement method, which was elected by the holders to reduce the number of shares issued upon exercise to reflect net settlement of the exercise price, resulting in the issuance of 322,278 shares of the Company’s common stock.
Revenue Recognition
The Company adopted ASC 606 on February 1, 2019, using the modified retrospective transition method. Under this method, results for reporting periods beginning on February 1, 2019 are presented under Topic 606, while prior period amounts are not adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with prior accounting under Topic 605.
In accordance with ASC 606, revenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of promised services. The amount of revenue recognized reflects the consideration that the Company expects to be entitled to receive in exchange for these services. To achieve the core principle of this standard, the Company applies the following five steps:
(1)Identify the contract with a customer
The Company considers the terms and conditions of contracts with customers and its customary business practices in identifying contracts under ASC 606. The Company determines it has a contract with a customer when the contract is approved, each party’s rights regarding the services to be transferred can be identified, payment terms for the services can be identified, it has been determined that the customer has the ability and intent to pay, and the contract has commercial substance. The Company applies judgment in determining the customer’s ability and intent to pay, which is based on a variety of factors, including the customer’s historical payment experience or, in the case of a new customer, credit and financial information pertaining to the customer.
(2)Identify the performance obligations in the contract
Performance obligations promised in a contract are identified based on the services that will be transferred to the customer that are both capable of being distinct, whereby the customer can benefit from the service either on its own or together with other resources that are readily available from the Company or from third parties, and are distinct in the context of the contract, whereby the transfer of the services is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract. The Company’s performance obligations consist of (i) subscriptions and (ii) professional services.
(3)Determine the transaction price
The transaction price is determined based on the consideration which the Company is expected to be entitled to in exchange for transferring services to the customer. Variable consideration is included in the transaction price if it is probable that a significant future reversal of cumulative revenue under the contract will not occur. None of the Company’s contracts contain a significant financing component.
(4)Allocate the transaction price to performance obligations in the contract
If the contract contains a single performance obligation, the entire transaction price is allocated to the single performance obligation. Contracts that contain multiple performance obligations require an allocation of the transaction price to each performance obligation based on a relative standalone selling price (“SSP”).
(5)Recognize revenue when or as performance obligations are satisfied
Revenue is recognized at the time the related performance obligation is satisfied by transferring the promised service to the customer. Revenue is recognized when control of the services is transferred to the customer, in an amount that reflects the
CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
consideration expected to be received in exchange for those services. The Company generates all its revenue from contracts with customers.
Subscription Revenue
The Company’s Falcon Platform technology solutions are subscription, SaaS offerings designed to continuously monitor, share, and mitigate risks from determined attackers. Customers do not have the right to take possession of the cloud-based software platform. Fees are based on several factors, including the solutions subscribed for by the customer and the number of endpoints purchased by the customer. The subscription fees are typically payable within 30 to 60 days after the execution of the arrangement, and thereafter upon renewal or subsequent installment. The Company initially records the subscription fees as deferred revenue and recognizes revenue on a straight-line basis over the term of the agreement.
The typical subscription term is one to three years. Most of the Company’s contracts are non-cancelable over the contractual term. Customers typically have the right to terminate their contracts for cause if the Company fails to perform in accordance with the contractual terms. Some customers have the option to purchase additional subscription at a stated price. These options generally do not provide a material right as they are priced at the Company’s SSP.
Professional Services Revenue
The Company offers several types of professional services including incident response and forensic services, surge forensic and malware analysis, and attribution analysis, which are focused on responding to imminent and direct threats, assessing vulnerabilities, and recommending solutions. These services are distinct from subscription services. Professional services do not result in significant customization of the subscription service. The professional services are available through hourly rate and fixed fee contracts, one-time and ongoing engagements, and retainer-based agreements. Revenue for time and materials arrangements is recognized as services are performed and revenue for fixed fees is recognized on a proportional performance basis as the services are performed.
Contracts with Multiple Performance Obligations
Some contracts with customers contain multiple promised services consisting of subscription and professional services that are distinct and accounted for separately. The transaction price is allocated to the separate performance obligations on a relative SSP basis. The SSP is the price at which the Company would sell promised subscription or professional services separately to a customer. Judgment is required to determine the SSP for each distinct performance obligation. The Company determines SSP based on its overall pricing objectives, taking into consideration the type of subscription or professional service and the number of endpoints.
Variable Consideration
Revenue from sales is recorded at the net sales price, which is the transaction price, and includes estimates of variable consideration. The amount of variable consideration that is included in the transaction price is constrained and is included in the net sales price only to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of the cumulative revenue will not occur when the uncertainty is resolved.
If subscriptions do not meet certain service level commitments, the Company’s customers are entitled to receive service credits, and in certain cases, refunds, each representing a form of variable consideration. The Company has historically not experienced any significant incidents affecting the defined levels of reliability and performance as required by its subscription contracts. Accordingly, any estimated refunds related to these agreements in the consolidated financial statements is not material during the periods presented.
The Company provides rebates and other credits within its contracts with certain resellers, which are estimated based on the most likely amounts expected to be earned or claimed on the related sales transaction. Overall, the transaction price is reduced to reflect the Company’s estimate of the amount of consideration to which it is entitled based on the terms of the contract. Estimated rebates and other credits were not material during the periods presented.
CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
Research and Development Expense
Research and development costs are expensed when incurred, except for certain internal-use software development costs, which may be capitalized as noted above. Research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel and related headcount costs, costs of professional services associated with the ongoing development of the Company’s technology, and allocated overhead.
Advertising
All advertising costs are expensed as incurred and are included in sales and marketing expense in the consolidated statements of operations. The Company incurred $27.9 million, $8.0 million, and $3.1 million of advertising costs during the years ended January 31, 2021, January 31, 2020, and January 31, 2019, respectively.
Stock-Based Compensation
The Company accounts for stock-based awards granted to employees and directors based on the awards’ estimated grant date fair value. The Company estimates the fair value of its stock options using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The resulting fair value is recognized on a straight-line basis over the period during which the employee or director is required to provide service in exchange for the award, usually the vesting period, which is generally four years. The Company accounts for forfeitures as they occur.
Restricted stock units (“RSUs”) granted under the 2011 Plan are subject to a service-based vesting condition and a performance-based vesting condition. The service-based vesting condition is generally satisfied based on one of three vesting schedules: (i) vesting of one-fourth of the RSUs on the first “Company vest date” (defined as March 20, June 20, September 20, or December 20) on or following the one-year anniversary of the vesting commencement date with the remainder of the RSUs vesting in twelve equal quarterly installments thereafter, subject to continued service, (ii) vesting in sixteen equal quarterly installments beginning on December 20, 2018, subject to continued service, or (iii) vesting in eight equal quarterly installments beginning on December 20, 2022, subject to continued service. The performance-based vesting condition is satisfied on the earlier of (i) a change in control, in which the consideration paid to holders of shares is either cash, publicly traded securities, or a combination thereof, or (ii) the first Company vest date to occur following the expiration of the lock-up period upon an IPO, subject to continued service through such change in control or lock-up expiration, as applicable. None of the RSUs vest unless the performance-based vesting condition is satisfied. Upon the completion of the IPO, the performance-based vesting condition was met and the Company recognized $17.3 million of deferred expense related to RSUs as of that date in its consolidated statement of operations. Upon its IPO, the Company began issuing RSUs to its employees and these RSUs generally have only a service condition. The service-based vesting condition is generally with a vesting term of four years. The valuation of such RSUs is based solely on the fair value of the Company’s stock price on the date of grant. Expense for RSUs that have a service-based condition only are being amortized on a straight-line basis.
Performance-based stock units (“PSUs”) granted under the 2019 Plan are subject to a performance-based vesting condition. With regard to the performance conditions, the fair value of new or modified awards is equal to the grant date fair market value of the Company’s common stock. PSUs generally vest over a four-year period and subject to continued service through the applicable vesting dates. The compensation cost is recognized over the requisite service period when it is probable that the performance condition will be satisfied.
Business Combinations
The Company allocates the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. Such valuations require management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. Significant estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include, but are not limited to, future expected cash flows from acquired users, acquired technology, trade names from a market participant perspective, useful lives and discount rates. Management’s estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from estimates. During the measurement period, which is one year from the acquisition date, the Company may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period, any subsequent adjustments are recorded in the consolidated statement of operations.

Goodwill and Intangible Assets
The Company evaluates and tests the recoverability of goodwill for impairment at least annually, on January 31, or more frequently if circumstances indicate that goodwill may not be recoverable. The Company performs the impairment testing by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of its reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. The Company has one reporting unit. If, after assessing the totality of events or circumstances, the Company determines it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the Company performs the first step of a two-step analysis by comparing the book value of net assets to the fair value of the reporting unit. To calculate any potential impairment, the Company compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. Any excess of the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s goodwill over its fair value is recognized as an impairment loss, and the carrying value of goodwill is written down. In assessing the qualitative factors, the Company considers the impact of certain key factors including macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, management turnover, changes in regulation, litigation matters, changes in enterprise value, and overall financial performance. No impairment was recorded during the years ended January 31, 2021, January 31, 2020, or January 31, 2019. The change in goodwill balance during the year ended January 31, 2021 was due to the acquisition of Preempt Security, Inc. and changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The change in goodwill balance during the year ended January 31, 2020 was due to the changes in foreign currency exchange rates. See Note 4 and Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for more information.
Acquired intangible assets consisting of identifiable intangible assets are comprised of developed technology, customer relationships, and non-compete agreements resulting from acquisitions. Acquired intangible assets are recorded at fair value on the date of acquisition and amortized over their estimated economic lives following the pattern in which the economic benefits of the assets will be consumed which is on a straight-line basis. Acquired intangible assets are presented net of accumulated amortization on the consolidated balance sheets. The Company reviews the carrying amounts of intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. The Company measures the recoverability of intangible assets by comparing the carrying amount of each asset to the future undiscounted cash flows it expects the asset to generate. If the Company considers any of these assets to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized equals the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value. In addition, the Company periodically evaluates the estimated remaining useful lives of long-lived assets to determine whether events or changes in circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining period of depreciation or amortization.
Operating Leases
The Company enters into operating lease arrangements for real estate assets related to office space. The Company determines if an arrangement is or contains a lease at inception by evaluating various factors, including whether a vendor’s right to substitute an identified asset is substantive. Lease classification is determined at the lease commencement date, which is the date the leased assets are made available for use. Operating leases are included in “Operating lease right-of-use assets”, “Operating lease liabilities, current”, and “Operating lease liabilities, noncurrent” in the consolidated balance sheets. The Company did not have any financing leases in any of the periods presented.
Operating lease right-of-use assets and lease liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. Lease payments consist of the fixed payments under the arrangement, less any lease incentives, such as tenant improvement allowances. Variable costs, such as maintenance and utilities based on actual usage, are not included in the measurement of right-to-use assets and lease liabilities but are expensed when the event determining the amount of variable consideration to be paid occurs. As the implicit rate of the leases is not determinable, the Company uses an incremental borrowing rate (“IBR”) based on the information available at the lease commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. Lease expenses are recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
The Company uses the non-cancelable lease term when recognizing the right-of-use (“ROU”) assets and lease liabilities, unless it is reasonably certain that a renewal or termination option will be exercised. The Company accounts for lease components and non-lease components as a single lease component.
Leases with a term of twelve months or less are not recognized on the consolidated balance sheets but are recognized as expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
Available-for-sale debt securities
The Company evaluates investments with unrealized loss positions by assessing if they are related to deterioration in credit risk and whether the Company expects to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security, the Company’s intent to sell and whether it is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the securities before the recovery of its cost basis. Credit-related impairment losses, not to exceed fair value less the amortized cost basis, are recognized through an allowance for credit losses with changes in the allowance for credit losses recorded in Other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations. Impairment that has not been recorded through an allowance for credit losses will be recorded in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss). As of January 31, 2021, there were no marketable securities held by the Company.
Debt Issuance Costs
Debt issuance costs incurred in connection with securing the Company’s financing arrangements are generally presented in the consolidated balance sheets as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the outstanding borrowings, consistent with debt discounts. However, the Company has chosen to present debt issuance costs under “other long-term assets” for its revolving credit facility on the consolidated balance sheets regardless of whether the Company has any outstanding borrowings on the revolving credit facility. Debt issuance costs, net of accumulated amortization, were $4.4 million and $1.2 million as of January 31, 2021 and January 31, 2020, respectively. Debt issuance cost associated with the Senior Notes are recorded as a reduction to the carrying value of the Senior Notes on the consolidated balance sheets. The unamortized issuance costs relating to the Senior Notes were $2.6 million as of January 31, 2021.
All deferred financing costs are being amortized to interest expense. The effective interest method is used for debt issuance cost related to the Senior Notes. Debt issuance costs related to the revolving credit facility are being amortized over the term of the financing arrangement under the straight-line method. The Company’s amortization of these costs was $0.8 million, $0.4 million and $0.1 million for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Foreign Currency Translation
The functional currencies of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries are each country’s local currency. Assets and liabilities of the subsidiaries are translated into U.S. Dollars at exchange rates in effect at the reporting date. Amounts classified in stockholders’ equity (deficit) are translated at historical exchange rates. Revenue and expenses are translated at the average exchange rates during the period. The resulting translation adjustments are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Foreign currency transaction gains or losses, whether realized or unrealized, are reflected in the consolidated statements of operations within Other income (expense), net, and have not been material for all periods presented.
Income Taxes
The Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities and net operating loss and credit carryforwards using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized.
The Company accounts for unrecognized tax benefits using a more-likely-than-not threshold for financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The Company establishes a liability for tax-related uncertainties based on estimates of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. The Company records an income tax liability, if any, for the difference between the benefit recognized and measured and the tax position taken or expected to be taken on the Company’s tax returns. To the extent that the assessment of such tax positions changes, the change in estimate is recorded in the period in which the determination is made. The liability is adjusted considering changing facts and circumstances, such as the outcome of a tax audit. The provision for income taxes includes the impact of liability provisions and changes to the liability that are considered appropriate. As the Company maintains a full valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets in the United States and United Kingdom, the changes resulted in no material tax expense during the years ended January 31, 2021, January 31, 2020, and January 31, 2019. As of January 31, 2021, the Company does not expect that changes in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits for the next twelve months will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.

Sales Taxes
When sales and other taxes are billed, such amounts are recorded as accounts receivable with a corresponding increase to other current liabilities, respectively. The balances are then removed from the consolidated balance sheets as cash is collected from the customer and as remitted to the respective tax authority.
Segment and Geographic Information
The Company’s chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) is its chief executive officer. The CODM reviews financial information presented on a consolidated basis for the purposes of allocating resources and evaluating financial performance. Accordingly, management has determined that the Company operates as one operating and reportable segment. The Company presents financial information about its geographic areas in Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements.
Net Loss per Share
The Company computes basic and diluted net loss per share attributable to common stockholders for Class A and Class B common stock using the two-class method required for participating securities. The Company considers all series of its redeemable convertible preferred stock to be participating securities. Net loss is attributed to Class A and Class B common stock based on their participation rights. Under the two-class method, basic net loss per share attributable to common stockholders is computed by dividing the net loss attributable to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period.
Diluted earnings per share attributable to common stockholders adjusts basic earnings per share for the potentially dilutive impact of outstanding stock options, RSUs, PSUs, ESPP obligations, warrants and redeemable convertible preferred stock. As the Company has reported losses for all periods presented, all potentially dilutive securities are antidilutive and accordingly, basic net loss per share equals diluted net loss per share.
Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements
In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-02, “Leases (Topic 842),” which requires lessees to generally recognize on the balance sheet operating and financing lease liabilities and corresponding ROU assets, and to recognize on the income statement the expenses in a manner similar to prior practice. The Company adopted Topic 842 using the modified retrospective method on February 1, 2020.
The Company elected the following practical expedients:
•The package of practical expedients which allows for not reassessing 1) whether existing contracts contain leases, 2) the lease classification of existing leases, and 3) whether existing initial direct costs meet the new definition.
•The practical expedient in ASC Subtopic 842-10 to not separate non-lease components from lease components and instead account for each separate lease component and non-lease components associated with that lease component as a single lease component by class of the underlying assets.
•Not to recognize right of use assets and lease liabilities for short-term leases, which have a lease term of twelve months or less and do not include an option to purchase the underlying asset that the Company is reasonably certain to exercise.
The Company did not elect the hindsight practical expedient.
Lease payments consist primarily of the fixed payments under the arrangement, less any lease incentives such as tenant improvement allowance. The Company uses an estimate of its IBR based on the information available at the lease commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments, unless the implicit rate is readily determinable. In determining the appropriate IBR, management considers information including, but not limited to, the Company’s credit rating, the lease term, and the currency in which the arrangement is denominated. For leases which commenced prior to the adoption of Topic 842, the Company used the IBR on January 31, 2020.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
The adoption of this new standard on February 1, 2020, and the application of the modified retrospective transition approach resulted in the following changes:
a.Assets increased by $37.4 million, primarily representing the recognition of ROU asset for operating leases; and
b.Liabilities increased by $37.4 million, primarily representing the recognition of lease liabilities for operating leases partially offset by derecognition of liabilities for deferred rent previously designated under ASC Topic 840
In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. This ASU requires a financial asset measured at amortized cost basis to be presented at the net amount expected to be collected, with further clarifications made more recently regarding the treatment of accrued interest, transfers between classifications for loans and debt securities, recoveries and the option to irrevocably elect the fair value option (on an instrument-by-instrument basis) for eligible financial assets at amortized costs. For trade receivables, loans, and other financial assets, the Company will be required to use a forward-looking expected loss model rather than the incurred loss model for recognizing credit losses which reflects losses that are probable. Credit losses relating to available-for-sale debt securities are required to be recorded through an allowance for credit losses in the consolidated statements of operation rather than as a reduction in the amortized cost basis of the securities. The Company adopted this guidance on February 1, 2020, which did not have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements.
In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment. This ASU simplifies the measurement of goodwill by eliminating step two of the two-step impairment test. Step two measures a goodwill impairment loss by comparing the implied fair value of a reporting unit’s goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. This ASU requires an entity to compare the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount and recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value. Additionally, an entity should consider income tax effects from any tax-deductible goodwill on the carrying amount of the reporting unit when measuring the goodwill impairment loss, if applicable. The Company adopted this guidance on February 1, 2020 which did not have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements.
In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-13, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Disclosure Framework-Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement. This ASU modifies the disclosure requirements on fair value measurements in Topic 820, Fair Value Measurement. The Company adopted this guidance on February 1, 2020 which did not have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements.
In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-15, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other-Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40): Customer’s Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement That Is a Service Contract (a consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force). This ASU aligns the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract with the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred to develop or obtain internal use software. The Company adopted this guidance on February 1, 2020 which did not have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements.
In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting. The ASU provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying generally accepted accounting principles to contract modifications and hedging relationships, subject to meeting certain criteria, that reference LIBOR or another reference rate expected to be discontinued. This ASU may be applied prospectively through December 31, 2022. The Company adopted this guidance on May 1, 2020 which did not have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements. Per the terms of the Company’s secured revolving credit facility (see Note 5), outstanding Eurodollar Loans incur interest at the Eurodollar Rate, which is defined in the Credit Agreement as LIBOR (or any successor thereto), plus a margin. The Company’s lender is currently preparing to use the Secured Overnight Funding Rate if LIBOR becomes unavailable. No amounts were outstanding under the Credit Agreement as of January 31, 2021.
Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements
In December 2019, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the “FASB”) issued ASU 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740), which enhances and simplifies various aspects of the income tax accounting guidance, including requirements such as tax basis step-up in goodwill obtained in a transaction that is not a business combination, ownership changes in investments, and interim-period accounting for enacted changes in tax law. For public business entities, this ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company does not anticipate that the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.

3. Fair Value Measurements and Marketable Securities
The Company follows ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements, with respect to marketable securities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis. Under the standard, fair value is defined as the exit price, or the amount that would be received to sell an asset or a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants as of the measurement date. The standard also establishes a hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the most observable inputs be used when available. Observable inputs are inputs market participants would use in valuing the asset or liability developed based on market data obtained from sources independent of the Company. Unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect the Company’s assumptions about the factors market participants would use in valuing the asset or liability developed based upon the best information available in the circumstances.
The hierarchy is broken down into three levels as follows:
Level 1 Assets and liabilities whose values are based on unadjusted quoted market prices for identical assets and liabilities in active markets.
Level 2 Assets and liabilities whose values are based on quoted prices in markets that are not active or inputs that are observable for substantially the full term of the asset or liability
Level 3 Assets and liabilities whose values are based on prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement
Categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
The Company’s fair value hierarchy for its financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis are as follows:

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
As of January 31, 2021, there were no marketable securities held by the Company. As of January 31, 2020, the amortized cost of the Company’s cash equivalents and marketable securities approximated their fair value and there were no material realized or unrealized gains or losses, either individually or in the aggregate. In addition, the securities that had been in continuous unrealized loss position per security type and in aggregate are not material as of January 31, 2020. There were no impairments considered “other-than-temporary” as it is more likely than not the Company will hold the securities until maturity or a recovery of the cost basis as of January 31, 2020.
The following summarizes the changes in strategic investments:
Year Ended January 31

Total initial cost $ 2,500 $ 1,000
Cumulative gain - -
Carrying value $ 2,500 $ 1,000
There was no unrealized gain and loss included as an adjustment to the carrying value related to non-marketable securities as of January 31, 2021.
The following summarizes the changes in the redeemable convertible preferred stock warrant liability, which is classified as a Level 3 instrument:
Year Ended January 31
2021 2020 2019
(in thousands)
Balance at beginning of period $ - $ 4,537 $ 961
Adjustment resulting from change in fair value recognized in the consolidated statement of operations - 6,022 3,576
Reclassification of redeemable convertible preferred stock warrant liability to additional paid-in capital upon IPO - (10,559) -
Balance at end of period $ - $ - $ 4,537
The fair value of the redeemable convertible preferred stock warrant liability was estimated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model and was based on significant inputs not observable in the market, and therefore was classified as a Level 3 instrument. The inputs include the Company’s preferred stock price, expected stock price volatility, risk-free interest rate, and contractual term. A loss of $6.0 million and $3.6 million was recorded as a component of Other income (expense), net, because of the remeasurement of the redeemable convertible preferred stock warrant liability during the years ended January 31, 2020, and January 31, 2019, respectively.

5. Debt
Secured Revolving Credit Facility
In April 2019, the Company entered into a Credit Agreement with Silicon Valley Bank and other lenders, to provide a revolving line of credit of up to $150.0 million, including a letter of credit sub-facility in the aggregate amount of $10.0 million, and a swingline sub-facility in the aggregate amount of $10.0 million.
On January 4, 2021, the Company amended and restated its existing credit agreement (the “A&R Credit Agreement” and the facility thereunder the “Revolving Facility”) among CrowdStrike, Inc., as borrower, CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc., as guarantor, and Silicon Valley Bank and the other lenders party thereto, providing the Company with a revolving line of credit of up to $750.0 million, including a letter of credit sub-facility in the aggregate amount of $100.0 million, and a swingline sub-facility in the aggregate amount of $50.0 million. The Company also has the option to request an incremental facility of up to an additional $250.0 million from one or more of the lenders under the A&R Credit Agreement. The A&R Credit Agreement is guaranteed by all of the Company’s material domestic subsidiaries. The A&R Credit Agreement extended the maturity date of April 19, 2022 to January 2, 2026. Under the A&R Credit Agreement, revolving loans may be either Eurodollar Loans or Alternate Base Rate (“ABR”) Loans. Outstanding Eurodollar Loans incur interest at the Eurodollar Rate, which is defined as LIBOR (or any successor thereto), subject to a 0.00% LIBOR floor, plus a margin between 1.50% and 2.00%, depending on the Company’s senior secured leverage ratio. Outstanding ABR Loans incur interest at the highest of (a) the Prime Rate, as published by the Wall Street Journal, (b) the federal funds rate in effect for such day plus 0.50%, and (c) the Eurodollar Rate plus 1.00%, in each case plus a margin between (0.25%) and 0.25%, depending on the senior secured leverage ratio. The Company will be charged a commitment fee of 0.15% to 0.25% per year for committed but unused amounts, depending on the senior secured leverage ratio. The financial covenants require the Company to maintain a minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio of 3.00:1.00, a maximum senior secured leverage ratio of 3.00:1.00 (through January 31, 2023), and a maximum total leverage ratio of 5.50:1.00 stepping down to 3.50:1.00 over time. The Company was in compliance with the financial covenants as of January 31, 2021.
The A&R Credit Agreement is secured by substantially all of the Company’s current and future consolidated assets, property and rights, including, but not limited to, intellectual property, cash, goods, equipment, contractual rights, financial assets, and intangible assets of the Company and certain of its subsidiaries. The A&R Credit Agreement contains customary covenants limiting the Company’s ability and the ability of its subsidiaries to, among other things, dispose of assets, undergo a change in control, merge or consolidate, make acquisitions, incur debt, incur liens, pay dividends, repurchase stock, and make investments, in each case subject to certain exceptions.
No amounts were outstanding under the A&R Credit Agreement as of January 31, 2021.

Senior Notes
On January 20, 2021, the Company issued $750.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 3.00% Senior Notes maturing in February 2029. The Senior Notes are guaranteed by the Company’s subsidiary, CrowdStrike, Inc. and will be guaranteed by each of the Company’s existing and future domestic subsidiaries that becomes a borrower or guarantor under the A&R Credit Agreement. The Senior Notes were issued at par and bear interest at a rate of 3.00% per annum. Interest payments are payable semiannually on February 15 and August 15 of each year, commencing on August 15, 2021. The Company may voluntarily redeem the Senior Notes, in whole or in part, 1) at any time prior to February 15, 2024 at (a) 100.00% of their principal amount, plus a “make whole” premium or (b) with the net cash proceeds received from an equity offering at a redemption price equal to 103.00% of the principal amount, provided the aggregate principal amount of all such redemptions does not to exceed 40% of the original aggregate principal amount of the notes; 2) at any time on or after February 15, 2024 at a prepayment price equal to 101.50% of the principal amount; 3) at any time on or after February 15, 2025 at a prepayment price equal to 100.75% of the principal amount; and 4) at any time on or after February 15, 2026 at a prepayment price equal to 100.00% of the principal amount; in each case, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to but excluding, the date of redemption.
The net proceeds from the debt offering were $739.6 million after deducting the underwriting commissions of $9.4 million and $1.0 million of issuance costs, which were paid as of January 31, 2021. An additional $1.6 million of issuance costs are expected to be paid in the first quarter of fiscal 2022. Debt issuance costs of $2.6 million are being amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method over the term of the Senior Notes. Interest expense related to contractual interest expense and amortization of debt issuance costs was $0.7 million and $0.1 million, respectively, during the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021.
In certain circumstances involving a change of control events, the Company will be required to make an offer to repurchase all or, at the holder’s option, any part, of each holder’s notes of that series at 101% of the aggregate principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the repurchase date.
The indenture governing the Senior Notes (the “Indenture”) contain covenants limiting the Company’s ability and the ability of its subsidiaries to create liens on certain assets to secure debt; grant a subsidiary guarantee of certain debt without also providing a guarantee of the Senior Notes; declare dividends; and consolidate or merge with or into, or sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its assets to, another person. These covenants are subject to a number of limitations and exceptions. Certain of these covenants will not apply during any period in which the notes are rated investment grade by Fitch Ratings, Inc. (“Fitch”), Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. (“Moody’s”) and Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services (“S&P”).
As of January 31, 2021, the Company was in compliance with all of its financial covenants under the Indenture associated with the Senior Notes.
Based on the trading prices of the Senior Notes, the fair value of the Senior Notes as of January 31, 2021 was approximately $760.2 million. While the Senior Notes are recorded at cost, the fair value of the Senior Notes was determined based on quoted prices in markets that are not active; accordingly, the Senior Notes is categorized as Level 2 for purposes of the fair value measurement hierarchy.

At each reporting date, the Company has established a valuation allowance against its U.S. net deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty surrounding the realization of those assets. During the fiscal year ended January 31, 2020, the Company has established a valuation allowance against its net U.K. deferred tax assets due to uncertainty surrounding the realization of those assets. The Company periodically evaluates the recoverability of the deferred tax assets and, when it is determined to be more-likely-than-not that the deferred tax assets are realizable, the valuation allowance is reduced. During the years ended January 31, 2021, January 31, 2020 and January 31, 2019, the valuation allowance increased by $206.2 million, $87.2 million, and $36.0 million, respectively. The increase in the valuation allowance during the years ended January 31, 2021, January 31, 2020 and January 31, 2019 was primarily driven by losses generated in the United States and the United Kingdom.
During the years ended January 31, 2021, January 31, 2020, and January 31, 2019, the valuation allowance for deferred taxes balance was $413.8 million, $207.6 million, and $120.4 million, respectively.
As of January 31, 2021, the Company had aggregate federal and California net operating loss carryforwards of $1.1 billion and $122.6 million, respectively, which may be available to offset future taxable income for income tax purposes. The federal and California net operating loss carryforwards begin to expire in fiscal 2031 through fiscal 2041. In addition, for federal losses generated after December 31, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (“Tax Act”) modified the maximum deduction of net operating loss, eliminated carryback, and provided an indefinite carryforward. As of January 31, 2021, net operating loss carryforwards for other states total $660.7 million which begin to expire in fiscal 2024 through fiscal 2041. As of January 31, 2021, net operating loss carryforwards for United Kingdom total $50.2 million which are carried forward indefinitely.
As of January 31, 2021, the Company had federal and California research and development (“R&D”) credit carryforwards of $38.7 million and $8.7 million, respectively. The federal R&D credit carryforwards will begin to expire in fiscal 2035 though fiscal 2041. The California R&D credits are carried forward indefinitely.
CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
Realization of these net operating loss and research and development credit carryforwards depends on future income, and there is a risk that the Company’s existing carryforwards could expire unused and be unavailable to offset future income tax liabilities.
The Internal Revenue Code imposes limitations on a corporation’s ability to utilize net operating loss (“NOLs”) and credit carryovers if it experiences an ownership change as defined in Section 382. In general terms, an ownership change may result from transactions increasing the ownership of certain stockholders in the stock of a corporation by more than 50% over a three-year period. If an ownership change has occurred, or were to occur, utilization of the Company’s NOLs and credit carryovers could be restricted.
The total gross unrecognized tax benefit as of January 31, 2021, January 31, 2020 and January 31, 2019 were $24.4 million, $5.5 million, and $8.1 million, respectively. As of January 31, 2021, the Company had $0.6 million of unrecognized tax benefits, which, if recognized, would affect the Company’s effective tax rate due to the full valuation allowance. The Company’s policy is to classify interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as part of the income tax provision in the consolidated statements of operations. The Company had no accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as of January 31, 2021, January 31, 2020 or January 31, 2019. During the year ended January 31, 2021, the uncertain tax benefits balance increased as a result of additional guidance released by the IRS. During the year ended January 31, 2020, the uncertain tax benefits balance decreased due to the application of the IRS’ simplified approach for determining research credits. The potential reduction in unrecognized tax benefits during the next 12 months is not expected to be material.
The following is a rollforward of the total gross unrecognized tax benefits for the years ended January 31, 2021, January 31, 2020, and January 31, 2019 (in thousands):
Balance as of February 1, 2018 $ 8,128

The Company files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various state jurisdictions. As the Company expands its global operations in the normal course of business, the Company could be subject to examination by taxing authorities throughout the world. These audits could include questioning the timing and amount of deductions; the nexus of income among various tax jurisdictions; and compliance with federal, state, local, and foreign tax laws. The Company is not currently under audit by the Internal Revenue Service or other similar state, local, and foreign authorities. All tax years remain subject to examination by U.S. taxing authorities due to the Company’s net operating losses and R&D credit carryforwards.
The Company attributes net revenue, costs, and expenses to domestic and foreign components based on the terms of its agreements with its subsidiaries. The Company does not provide for federal and state income taxes on the undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries as such earnings are to be reinvested offshore indefinitely. As a result of the Tax Act, if the Company repatriated these earnings, the tax impact of future distributions of foreign earnings would generally be limited to withholding tax from local jurisdictions, and the resulting income tax liability would be insignificant.
On March 27, 2020, the United States enacted the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (“CARES Act”),
as a response to the economic uncertainty resulting from the global COVID-19 pandemic. The CARES Act did not have a material impact on the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021. The Company continues to monitor any effects that may result from the CARES Act.

10. Stock-Based Compensation
Stock Incentive Plan
In May 2019, the Company’s board of directors adopted, and the stockholders approved the CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. 2019 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2019 Plan”) with the purpose of granting stock-based awards to employees, directors, officers and consultants, including stock options, restricted stock awards, restricted stock units and performance-based restricted stock units. A total of 8,750,000 shares of Class A common stock were initially available for issuance under the 2019 Plan. The Company’s compensation committee administers the 2019 Plan. The number of shares of the Company’s common stock available for issuance under the 2019 Plan is subject to an annual increase on the first day of each fiscal year beginning on February 1, 2020, equal to the lesser of: (i) two percent (2.0%) of outstanding shares of the Company’s capital stock as of the last day of the immediately preceding fiscal year or (ii) such other amount as the Company’s board of directors may determine.
The 2011 Plan was terminated on June 10, 2019, which was the business day prior to the effectiveness of the Company’s registration statement on Form S-1 used in connection with the Company’s IPO, and stock-based awards are no longer granted under the 2011 Plan. Any shares underlying stock options that expire or terminate or are forfeited or repurchased under the 2011 Plan will be automatically transferred to the 2019 Plan.

Stock Options
The Company records compensation expense for employee stock options based on the estimated fair value of the options on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the assumptions included in the table below. The expected term represents the period that the Company’s share-based awards are expected to be outstanding. The expected term assumptions were determined based on the vesting terms, exercise terms, and contractual lives of the options. The expected stock price volatility is based upon comparable public company data. The risk-free rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for the estimated option life.
The fair value of each option was estimated on the date of grant using the following assumptions during the period:

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
Total unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to unvested options was $24.3 million as of January 31, 2021. This expense is expected to be amortized on a straight-line basis over a weighted-average vesting period of 1.7 years.

This expense is expected to be amortized on a straight-line basis over a weighted-average vesting period of 2.1 years.
Early Exercise of Employee Options
The 2011 Stock Plan allows for the early exercise of stock options for certain individuals as determined by the Board of Directors. The consideration received for an early exercise of an option is a deposit of the exercise price and the related dollar amount is recorded as a liability for early exercise of unvested stock options in the consolidated balance sheets. This liability is reclassified to additional paid-in capital as the awards vest. If a stock option is early exercised, the unvested shares may be repurchased by the Company in case of employment termination or for any reason, including death and disability, at the price paid by the purchaser for such shares. There were no issued shares of common stock related to early exercised stock option during the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021. During the fiscal year ended January 31, 2020, the Company issued 1,037,356 shares of common stock for total proceeds of $10.3 million related to early exercised stock options. As of January 31, 2021, the number of shares of common stock related to early exercised stock options subject to repurchase was 548,028 shares for $5.4 million. As of January 31, 2020, the number of shares of common stock related to early exercised stock options subject to repurchase was 984,417 shares for $8.7 million. Common stock purchased pursuant to an early exercise of stock options is not deemed to be outstanding for accounting purposes until those shares vest. The Company includes unvested shares subject to repurchase in the number of shares outstanding in the consolidated statement of redeemable convertible preferred stock and stockholders’ equity (deficit).
Tender Offer Transaction
In October 2018, the Company facilitated a tender offer of its common stock. Under the terms of the offer, certain existing Series E Preferred Stock investors purchased an aggregate of 2.4 million shares of common stock from certain eligible employees and directors for $15.64 per share for an aggregate purchase price of $37.6 million. The Company recognized stock-based compensation expense of $10.8 million during the year ended January 31, 2019 in connection with the tender offer, which represented the difference between the purchase price and the fair value of the common stock on the date of the sale.
Restricted Stock Units
Beginning in September 2018, the Company began issuing RSUs to certain employees. These RSUs include a service-based vesting condition and a performance-based vesting condition. The service-based vesting condition is generally satisfied based on one of three vesting schedules: (i) vesting of one-fourth of the RSUs on the first “Company vest date” (defined as March 20, June 20, September 20, or December 20) on or following the one-year anniversary of the vesting commencement date with the remainder of the RSUs vesting in twelve equal quarterly installments thereafter, subject to continued service, (ii) vesting in sixteen equal quarterly installments beginning on December 20, 2018, subject to continued service, or (iii) vesting in eight equal quarterly installments beginning on December 20, 2022, subject to continued service. The performance-based vesting condition is satisfied on the earlier of (i) a change in control, in which the consideration paid to holders of shares is either cash, publicly traded securities, or a combination thereof, or (ii) the first Company vest date to occur following the expiration of the lock-up period upon an IPO, subject to continued service through such change in control or lock-up expiration, as applicable. None of the RSUs vest unless the performance-based vesting condition is satisfied. Upon the completion of the IPO, the performance-based vesting condition was met and the Company recognized $17.3 million of deferred expense related to RSUs as of that date in its consolidated statement of operations. Upon its IPO, the Company began issuing RSUs to its employees that generally have only service-based vesting condition. The valuation of such RSUs is based solely on the fair value of the Company’s stock price on the date of grant.
Expense for RSUs that have a service-based vesting condition only are being amortized on a straight-line basis. Expense for RSUs that have both a service-based and a performance-based vesting condition are being amortized under the accelerated attribution method. Total unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to unvested RSUs was $393.9 million as of January 31, 2021. This expense is expected to be amortized (subject to acceleration or straight-line basis) over a weighted-average vesting period of 2.6 years. Total unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to unvested RSUs was $139.4 million as of January 31, 2020. This expense is expected to be amortized on an accelerated attribution method over a weighted-average vesting period of 2.5 years.

Performance-based Stock Units
Performance-based stock units (“PSUs”) granted under the 2019 Plan are generally subject to both a service-based vesting condition and a performance-based vesting condition. PSUs will vest upon the achievement of specified performance targets and subject to continued service through the applicable vesting dates. The compensation cost is recognized over the requisite service period when it is probable that the performance condition will be satisfied. During fiscal 2021, the Company’s compensation committee granted PSUs for certain employees. The performance goal for certain grants primarily relate to the revenue growth percentage for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021, with the number of PSUs earned corresponding to the performance period of fiscal 2021, which can range between 0% and 130% of the target number of shares granted depending on the Company’s actual performance. The performance goal for other grants primarily relate to the achievement of product related deliverables or other engineering objectives.
Expense for PSUs are being amortized under the accelerated attribution method and may be adjusted over the vesting period based on interim estimates of performance against pre-set objectives. Total unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to unvested PSUs was $24.8 million as of January 31, 2021. This expense is expected to be amortized over a weighted-average vesting period of 1.3 years. Total unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to unvested PSUs was $2.7 million as of January 31, 2020. This expense is expected to be amortized over a weighted-average vesting period of 1.6 years.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan
In May 2019, the board of directors adopted, and the stockholders approved the CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. 2019 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”), which became effective on June 10, 2019, which was the business day prior to the effectiveness of the Company’s registration statement on Form S-1 used in connection with the Company’s IPO. A total of 3,500,000 shares of Class A common stock were initially reserved for issuance under the ESPP. The Company’s compensation committee administers the ESPP. The number of shares of common stock available for issuance under the ESPP is subject to an annual increase on the first day of each fiscal year beginning on February 1, 2020, equal to the lesser of: (i) one percent (1%) of outstanding shares of the Company’s capital stock as of the last day of the immediately preceding fiscal year or (ii) such other amount as its board of directors may determine.
The ESPP provides for consecutive offering periods that will typically have a duration of approximately 24 months in length and is comprised of four purchase periods of approximately six months in length. The offering periods are scheduled to start on the first trading day on or after June 11 and December 11 of each year. The first offering period commenced on June 11, 2019 and is scheduled to end on the first trading day on or before June 10, 2021.
CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
The ESPP provides eligible employees with an opportunity to purchase shares of the Company’s Class A common stock through payroll deductions of up to 15% of their eligible compensation. A participant may purchase a maximum of 2,500 shares of common stock during a purchase period. Amounts deducted and accumulated by the participant are used to purchase shares of common stock at the end of each six-month purchase period. The purchase price of the shares shall be 85% of the lower of the fair market value of the Class A common stock on (i) the first trading day of the applicable offering period and (ii) the last trading day of each purchase period in the related offering period. Participants may end their participation at any time during an offering period and will be paid their accrued contributions that have not yet been used to purchase shares of common stock. Participation ends automatically upon termination of employment. The ESPP allows for up to one increase in contribution during each purchase period. If an employee elects to increase his or her contribution, the Company treats this as an accounting modification. The pre- and post-modification fair values are calculated on the date of the modification, and the incremental expense is then amortized over the remaining purchase period. Incremental expense as a result of such modification was $3.5 million for year ended January 31, 2021.
Employee payroll contributions ultimately used to purchase shares are reclassified to stockholders’ equity on the purchase date. ESPP employee payroll contributions accrued of $11.0 million and $6.6 million as of January 31, 2021 and January 31, 2020, respectively, and are included within accrued payroll and benefits in the consolidated balance sheets.
The following table summarizes the assumptions used in the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to determine fair value of the Company’s common shares to be issued under the ESPP for the offering periods beginning in June 2019:

The Company uses channel partners to complement direct sales and marketing efforts. The partners place an order with the Company after negotiating the order directly with an end customer. The partners negotiate pricing with the end customer and in some rare instances are responsible for certain support levels directly with the end customer. The Company’s contract is with the partner and payment to the Company is not contingent on the receipt of payment from the end customer. The Company recognizes the contractual amount charged to the partners as revenue ratably over the term of the arrangement once access to the Company’s solution has been provided to the end customer.
The Company also uses referral partners who refer customers in exchange for a referral fee. The Company negotiates pricing and contracts directly with the end customer. The Company recognizes revenue from the sales to the end customers, ratably over the term of the contract, once access to the Company’s solution has been provided to the end customer.

Contract Balances
Contract liabilities consist of deferred revenue and include payments received in advance of performance under the contract. Such amounts are recognized as revenue over the contractual period. The Company recognized revenue of $410.7 million and $217.9 million for the years ended January 31, 2021 and January 31, 2020, respectively, that were included in the corresponding contract liability balance at the beginning of the period.
The Company receives payments from customers based upon contractual billing schedules. Accounts receivable are recorded when the right to consideration becomes unconditional. Payment terms on invoiced amounts are typically 30 - 60 days. Contract assets include amounts related to the contractual right to consideration for both completed and partially completed performance obligations that may not have been invoiced
Changes in deferred revenue were as follows (in thousands):
Carrying Amount
Year Ended January 31,
2021 2020
Beginning Balance $ 571,168 $ 290,067

Recognition of deferred revenue (874,438) (481,413)
Ending Balance $ 911,895 $ 571,168
Remaining Performance Obligations
The Company’s subscription contracts with its customers have a typical term of one to three years and most subscription contracts are non-cancelable. Customers typically have the right to terminate their contracts for cause as a result of the Company’s failure to perform. As of January 31, 2021, the aggregate amount of the transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations was $1.4 billion. The Company expects to recognize 72% of the remaining performance obligations in the 12 months following January 31, 2021, with the remainder to be recognized thereafter.
Costs to Obtain and Fulfill a Contract
The Company capitalizes referral fees paid to partners and sales commission and associated payroll taxes paid to internal sales personnel that are incremental to the acquisition of channel partner and direct customer contracts and would not have occurred absent the customer contract. These costs are recorded as deferred contract acquisition costs, current and deferred contract acquisition costs, noncurrent on the consolidated balance sheets.
Sales commissions for renewal of a contract are not considered commensurate with the commissions paid for the acquisition of the initial contract or follow-on upsell given the substantive difference in commission rates in proportion to their respective contract values. Commissions, including referral fees paid to channel partners, earned upon the initial acquisition of a contract or subsequent upsell are amortized over an estimated period of benefit of 4 years while commissions earned for renewal contracts are amortized over the contractual term of the renewals. Sales commissions associated with professional service contracts are amortized ratably over an estimated period of benefit of six months and included in sales and marketing expense in the consolidated statements of operations. In determining the period of benefit for commissions paid for the acquisition of the initial contract, the Company took into consideration the expected subscription term and expected renewals of customer contracts, the historical duration of relationships with customers, customer retention data, and the life of the developed technology. The Company periodically reviews the carrying amount of deferred contract acquisition costs to determine whether events or changes in circumstances have occurred that could impact the period of benefit of these deferred costs. The Company did not recognize any material impairment losses of deferred contract acquisition costs during the year ended January 31, 2021.
The following table summarizes the activity of deferred contract acquisition costs:

Litigation
In November 2016, Fair Isaac Corporation (“FICO”) filed a petition before the Trademark Trial and Appellate Board (“TTAB”) at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, seeking cancellation of the Company’s registration of its “CrowdStrike Falcon” trademark, and a notice of opposition of the Company’s trademark application for “Falcon OverWatch.” The Company denies that any of the relief FICO seeks is appropriate, and has itself moved to cancel, or in the alternative amend, FICO’s “Falcon” trademark registrations before the TTAB. The proceedings have been consolidated and are in the discovery phase with trial periods scheduled to begin in October 2021. The Company is vigorously defending the case, but given the early stage, although a loss may reasonably be possible, the Company is unable to predict the likelihood of success of FICO’s claims or estimate a loss or range of loss. As a result, no liability has been recorded as of January 31, 2021 or January 31, 2020.
In addition, the Company is involved in various other legal proceedings and subject to claims that arise in the ordinary course of business, including a letter demand from a former employee purportedly on behalf of himself and similarly situated employees alleging various wage and hour violations. The Company is vigorously defending the claim, but given the early stage, although a loss may reasonably be possible, the Company is unable to predict the likelihood of the claim’s success or estimate a loss or range of loss. For any claims for which the Company believes a liability is both probable and reasonably estimable, the Company records a liability in the period for which it makes this determination. There is no pending or threatened legal proceeding to which the Company is a party that, in the Company’s opinion, is likely to have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial statements; however, the results of litigation and claims are inherently unpredictable. Regardless of the outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on the Company’s business because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources, and other factors. In addition, the expense of litigation and the timing of this expense from period to period are difficult to estimate, subject to change and could adversely affect the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

Warranties and Indemnification
The Company’s cloud computing services are typically warranted to perform in a manner consistent with general industry standards that are reasonably applicable and materially in accordance with the Company’s online help documentation under normal use and circumstances.
The Company’s arrangements generally include certain provisions for indemnifying customers against liabilities if its products or services infringe a third party’s intellectual property rights. In addition, for its Falcon Complete customers, the Company offers a limited warranty, subject to certain conditions, to cover certain costs incurred by the customer in case of a cybersecurity breach. The Company has entered into an insurance policy to cover its potential liability arising from this limited warranty arrangement. To date, the Company has not incurred any material costs because of such obligations and has not accrued any liabilities related to such obligations in the consolidated financial statements.
The Company has also agreed to indemnify its directors and certain executive officers for costs associated with any fees, expenses, judgments, fines and settlement amounts incurred by any of these persons in any action or proceeding to which any of those persons is, or is threatened to be, made a party by reason of the person’s service as a director or officer, including any action by the Company, arising out of that person’s services as the Company’s director or officer or that person’s services provided to any other company or enterprise at the Company’s request. The Company maintains director and officer insurance coverage that would generally enable the Company to recover a portion of any future amounts paid. The Company may also be subject to indemnification obligations by law with respect to the actions of its employees under certain circumstances and in certain jurisdictions. No liabilities have been accrued associated with this indemnification provision as of January 31, 2021 or January 31, 2020.

15. Acquisitions
On September 30, 2020, the Company acquired 100% of the equity interest of Preempt Security, Inc. (“Preempt Security”), a privately-held Delaware corporation that developed real-time access control and threat prevention technology (the “Acquisition”). The Acquisition has been accounted for a business combination. The total consideration transferred was $91.2 million which consisted of $87.4 million in cash and $3.8 million representing the fair value of replacement equity awards attributable to pre-acquisition service. The purchase price was allocated, on a preliminary basis, to identified intangible assets, which include developed technology, customer relationships and trade names, of $16.4 million, net tangible assets acquired of $(0.5) million and goodwill of $75.3 million allocated to the Company’s one reporting segment, representing the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired. The goodwill was primarily attributable to the assembled workforce of Preempt Security, planned growth in new markets and synergies expected to be achieved from the integration of Preempt Security. Goodwill is not deductible for income tax purposes.
Per the terms of the merger agreement with Preempt Security, certain unvested stock options held by Preempt Security employees were canceled and exchanged for replacement stock options under the 2019 Plan. Additionally, certain shares of stock issued pursuant to share-based compensation awards to key employees of Preempt Security were canceled and exchanged for replacement RSUs of the Company, which are subject to future vesting. The portion of the fair value of the replacement equity awards associated with pre-acquisition service of Preempt Security’s employees represented a component of the total purchase consideration. The remaining fair value of these issued awards is subject to the recipients’ continued service with the Company and the achievement of specified performance targets, and thus were excluded from the purchase price. The awards which are subject to continued service will be recognized ratably as stock-based compensation expense over the requisite service period. The awards which are based on specified performance targets will be recognized under the accelerated attribution method. The Company is still finalizing the allocation of the purchase price, which may be subject to change as additional information becomes available.
The following table sets forth the components of identifiable intangible assets acquired and their estimated useful lives as of the date of acquisition:
Fair Value Useful Life
(in thousands) (in months)
Developed technology $ 13,200 60
Customer relationships 3,100 60
Trade names 85 12
Total intangible assets acquired $ 16,385
The Company incurred acquisition expense of $2.5 million for the year ended January 31, 2021. The acquisition costs are recorded in general and administrative expenses on the Company’s consolidated statement of operations.
The results of operations of Preempt Security have been included in the Company’s consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition. The acquisition of Preempt Security did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements, and therefore historical and pro forma disclosures have not been presented.

One-half of the founder holdbacks will vest after one year of continued employment, with the remainder vesting monthly during the second year. The share price will be determined based on the Company’s average stock price 5 days prior to each vesting date.

Note 17. Subsequent Events
On March 5, 2021, the Company announced that it completed its acquisition of Humio, a leading provider of high-performance cloud log management and observability technology. The Company paid approximately $352.0 million in cash (net of cash acquired) and $40.0 million in stock and options, subject to vesting conditions, to acquire Humio. Due to the proximity of the acquisition date to the Company’s filing of its annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended January 31, 2021, the initial accounting for the acquisition of Humio is incomplete, and therefore the Company is unable to disclose certain information required by ASC 805, Business Combinations at this time, including the provisional amounts recognized as of the acquisition date for each major class of assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and goodwill.","Item 9.

Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, believes that our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and are effective at the reasonable assurance level. However, our management does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and
the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.","Item 9B. Other Information

BUSINESS
Overview
At Synchronoss, we build products that deliver trusted and engaging experiences for our customers and their subscribers at the moments that matter most. Our mission is to provide leading cloud, digital, messaging and network management platforms our customers use to connect, engage and monetize subscribers in more meaningful ways. Our technologies act as a catalyst to enable and unlock new capabilities in our customers’ organizations, creating value through new experiences for their end users and capitalizing on the rapidly converging services, connected devices, networks and applications.
Our businesses span primarily across four pillars and focus on driving profitable growth in business-to-consumer (“B2C”), business-to-business (“B2B”), enterprise and indirect channel (i.e., resellers/dealers) experiences.
•White Label Personal Cloud: Cloud sync, backup, storage, device set up, content transfer and content engagement for user generated content.
•Messaging: White label consumer email solutions. Advanced, multi-channel messaging peer-to-peer (“P2P”) communications and application-to-person (“A2P”) commerce solutions.
•Digital: Customer journey and workflow design, development, orchestration and experience management.
•Total Network Management (“TNM”): integrated application suite that designs, procures, manages and optimizes telecom network infrastructure.
At Synchronoss, we are focused on delivering value to our customers and their end users through:
Managing Complexity:
Many companies struggle with legacy infrastructure and extensive software development lifecycles due to competing priorities. Within Synchronoss, we focus on managing and reducing the complexity, making it simple for our customers to deliver the trusted experiences their (end user) customers expect to have with them. Our platforms resolve complexity with back-end data and system frameworks to create simple, easy use cases to end users and subscribers.
AI and Machine Learning:
Our platforms, products and solutions operate with the assistance of analytics, smart tagging, artificial intelligence, natural language processing, reporting and other data-driven insights. Our technology uses data to help shape user experiences, summarize reporting, prompt next best actions and recommendations and conduct automated dialogue with subscribers.
Trust & Dependability:
We are committed to providing high-quality, dependable services to our customers. To ensure reliability, system uptime and other service offerings, our transaction management is guaranteed through Service Level Agreements (“SLAs”). Our platforms offer a complete customer management solution, including exception handling, which we believe is one of the main factors that differentiates us from our competitors.
Extensibility, Relevance & Scalability:
Our platforms and solutions are built in a modular fashion, thereby conducive to be extended dynamically and enabling our customers to offer solutions that are relevant to current market situations, with the goal of providing them with the competitive edge required for them to be successful. We support expanding transaction volumes reliably and cost effectively with platforms built to scale. Our Synchronoss Personal Cloud platform is deployed across more than 95 million devices, managing 20 billion entities in the Cloud and performing more than 4 million synchronizations per day.
Security & Reliability
The marketplace is fraught with a constantly changing security threat landscape and increasingly vulnerable to attacks. Various governing bodies and companies are on heightened alert and aware of these increasing threats. Customers rely on us to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of sensitive company and client information including the systems and platforms they reside on. We also aims to safeguard the reputation of the company and its customers in the marketplace, maintain compliance with applicable laws and regulatory standards, and protect the privacy of user information. All of our platforms have security oversight and are governed from an information security standpoint by the Synchronoss Information Security Program which is designed to achieve these goals and priorities.
Who We Serve
At Synchronoss, we help our customers accelerate and monetize value-add services to drive growth, retention and enable differentiated experiences. Our technologies appeal to a diverse group of customers in a converging TMT space including:
•Communication service providers (“CSP”)
•Cable operators/multi-services operators (“MSO”)
•Media and Technology Companies with multi-customer-facing channels in global markets
•OEMs with embedded connectivity (e.g., smartphones, laptops, tablets and mobile internet devices)
•Mobile Insurance Providers
Our platforms, products and solutions operate in a white label capacity serving a diverse range of customers in the Telecommunications, Media and Technology (“TMT”) markets and enabling our customers to drive differentiated and trusted experiences with their customer.
Telecommunications, Media and Technology
TMT companies operate and/or market white label instantiations of Synchronoss Cloud, Messaging, and Digital platforms, products and solutions to power new, digitally enhanced experiences for their subscribers and employees. TMT companies use our platforms to author and manage new workflows and customer experiences, orchestrate data from existing back-office systems and create personalized customer experiences across channels and touch points (e.g., online, mobile apps, call centers and care, retail, self-service, etc.).
Operators
CSPs, MSOs and Mobile Insurance Providers market white-label implementations of our Synchronoss Cloud, Messaging, and Digital platforms, products and solutions to their subscribers around the world. CSPs and MSOs market and re-sell the value-added services powered by our technology to their subscribers as part of stand-alone subscriptions, value-added bundles or use our technologies directly to enhance their digital offerings and workflow. CSPs and MSOs license Synchronoss Personal Cloud to enhance their value-added service offerings to subscribers who purchase and lease mobile devices and network connectivity - storing and syncing their user generated content (e.g., videos, photos, documents, contacts, music etc.). CSPs and MSOs license Synchronoss Advanced Messaging and Email to enable white label multichannel messaging services including advanced P2P, A2P transactions and brand/advertiser ecosystems.
Our customers include global service providers such as AT&T, BT, Verizon, Vodafone, T-Mobile, Softbank and MSOs like Comcast, Altice, Charter and Mediacom. These customers utilize our platforms and services to service both consumer and enterprise customers.
How We Go to Market
We market our solutions and services directly through our sales organizations in the Americas, Europe, Middle East and Africa (“EMEA”) and Asia-Pacific (“APAC”). We have invested significantly in our sales, marketing and operations to expand our historically North American presence and revenue weighting to a global presence especially in the EMEA and APAC markets.
Sales
We sell our platforms, products, and services through a direct sales force, with strategic partners and in collaboration with our customers to re-sell services to their end customers and subscribers. Our sales professionals are well versed in our platforms, products and services with domain understanding of market trends, demands and conditions that our current and potential customers are facing.
Marketing
The Synchronoss Corporate Marketing team is the face of our organization. Their mission is to deliver the right strategy, tools, support and customer acquisition initiatives that accelerate our growth. They play a vital role in promoting our products, discovering new markets, and driving subscriber growth, retention, and loyalty initiatives for all cloud deployments globally.

Our Synchronoss Personal Cloud™ solution features products that facilitate the transfer of mobile content from one smart device to another.
•Mobile Content Transfer: Our Synchronoss Mobile Content Transfer™ solution is an easy-to-use product whose client enables a secure, peer-to-peer, wireless transfer of content from one mobile smart device to another in a carrier retail location or at home/work, etc. Our solution can transfer select data classes that may include photos, videos, music, messages, documents, contacts, and call logs, across operating systems including iOS and Android.
•Backup & Transfer: Our Synchronoss Backup & Transfer™ solution is a variation of Synchronoss Mobile Content Transfer™ that offers the same peer-to-peer transfer of select data classes across smart mobile devices and major operating systems and also offers the ability to send supported data classes that may include photos, videos, music, messages, documents, contacts and call logs up to the cloud for temporary storage and then restore the content back into the new device or to a new device with the same client.
Messaging Platform
Synchronoss’ Messaging Platform powers mobile messaging and mailboxes for hundreds of millions of telecommunication subscribers. Our Advanced Messaging platform is a powerful, secure, intelligent, white-label messaging platform that expands capabilities for Operators and TMT companies to offer P2P messaging via Rich Communications Services (“RCS”). Our Mobile Messaging Platform (“MMP”) is poised to provide a single standard ecosystem onboarding and management to brands, advertisers and message wholesalers.
•Advanced Messaging: Our Advanced Messaging platform supports rich messaging channel in both RCS and other Real-Time Communication (“RTC”) and enables rich, P2P communications and creates new commerce and revenue opportunities across channels via A2P experiences for Operators and other brands. Our messaging platform operates in tandem with Messaging-as-a-Platform (“MaaP”), Messaging Marketplace as well as dedicated, third-party clients and native OEM clients, providing an end-end to messaging platform and monetization tools to the operators, CpassS players and brands.
•E-Mail: Our Email suite provides service providers with a secure, white-label, back-end framework for a branded email service that provides the opportunity to introduce and promote services that can be monetized. Our carrier branded Email solution offers leading anti-virus & anti-spam and malware technology to keep the integrity and security of the customer experience and protection of subscriber data to carrier standards. Our Email solution is an important repository for critical communications with an intuitive and feature-rich mobile and desktop email experience ensuring stickiness and increasing customer lifetime value.
Total Network Management
The Synchronoss Total Network Management application provides operators with the tools and software to design their physical network, streamline their infrastructure purchases, and manage and optimize comprehensive network expense for leading top tier carriers around the globe.
•spatialSUITE: Our spatialSUITE provides enterprise-wide access to timely, accurate, and comprehensive network information - including physical location, specifications, attributes, connectivity and capacity - for every inside-plant and outside-plant asset. It delivers data across the enterprise to support provisioning, planning and design, construction, fault and event management, work order management, customer service, marketing and other critical business functions. The automation and ease of integration of our platform is designed to enable our customers to lower the cost of new subscriber acquisitions and enhance the accuracy and reliability of customer transactions.
•Interconnect NOW (iNOW): Our iNOW provisioning system eliminates manual handling of service orders and manages the full order lifecycle between customer and supplier via automation and rules-based validation. iNOW includes an interface that powers bulk provisioning needs and an open API to seamlessly integrate to other carrier systems. iNOW also provides an electronically bonded gateway platform enabling rapid electronic order confirmations and status updates between bonded carriers. Finally, completed order information flows to Financial Analytics providing integrated and automated order to billing reconciliation functionality.
•Financial Analytics: Our Financial Analytics Platform is a comprehensive application suite that helps operators reduce costs, mitigate risks, enforce financial compliance and controls, and increase operational efficiencies. Financial Analytics ingests any supplier invoice (in any format) through a unique software-driven process - with 100% of the detail. Invoices are managed via automated audit and payment workflow tightly coupled with a software driven dispute management lifecycle, providing a true procurement-to-payment process on network expenses and disputes across a carrier’s organization.
Digital
The Synchronoss Digital Platform is a suite of technology, tools and solutions that includes digital experience creation and management, automated provisioning, artificial intelligence and financial analytics that service a broad swatch of TMT markets.
By equipping our customers with a toolkit of capabilities, they can design, deploy and manage end user customer journeys and workflows easily and quickly from one central platform that also integrates across front end customer engagement channels as well as enterprise business systems (e.g. CRM, POS) allowing non-citizen developers to configure rather than code experiences. The platform sits between customer-facing touch points and a customer’s existing back-office systems to orchestrate data, workflows and processes into digital customer journeys that interface with end user channels creating user experiences that can be centrally managed and coordinated with less resources than is typical in a traditional IT environment.
•Digital Experience Platform (“DXP”) is a purpose-built, low-code experience creation and management toolset that sits between our customers’ end-user facing applications and their existing back end systems, enabling the authoring and management of customer journeys in a cloud-native no/low-code environment.
•Our Digital Activation Module is powered by DXP and allows Operators and indirect mobility resellers to activate mobility plans with carriers without large, dedicated teams and affords flexibility at a fraction of the cost and time to go to market.
Demand Drivers for Our Business
In today’s business landscape, ‘Digital Transformation’ is not new or novel anymore; it is a necessary way of doing business in a landscape where access to technology has become democratized and the effects of citizen developers can change entire industries overnight. TMT providers need to digitally transform to increase and find new sources of revenue, reduce operational cost and complexity and improve the appeal of their products and services to better compete with new standards set by over-the-top (“OTT”) competitors.
Overall Trends in the TMT Market
•Convergence
•Digital Transformation
•Regulation
•Disintermediation
•5G
The biggest growth driver of the next five years is predicted to be the global adoption of 5G networks, and the epoch change in business that comes with it. In the U.S alone, telecom giant Ericsson predicts 320M 5G subscribers by 2025 with 86% of Deloitte-surveyed networking executives expecting advanced wireless solutions to transform their business within three years. 5G is being ushered in by network operators as a platform for innovation, not simply a next-generation improvement to network infrastructure. 5G is a hundred times faster than the current 4G technology, capable of supporting one hundred times more devices / km2 with a 50X improvement in total latency. While the extra speed and capacity that 5G provides is important, the improvements in network latency will usher in an entirely new spectrum of use cases that require instantaneous processing of large, multi-device data sets and faster, Artificial Intelligence decision-making at the edge. With 5G still in its infancy we believe there is significant opportunity to evolve our Personal Cloud and Advanced Messaging products to deliver a connected, personalized, 5G-enhanced experience for consumers.
According to a recent study by Ericsson - with over 35,000 participants from 22 countries representing the opinions of over 1 billion smartphone users globally - 43% of smartphone users are willing to pay a significant premium for a 5G plan expect new applications and services as a part of the offering. And with that new, shiny plan 5G users are expected to consume, on average, 2-3X more data than their 4G counterparts with an expected 76% of that traffic being attributed to video by 2025. As more smart devices come online and more personal content is uploaded in 4K/8K Ultra-HD we believe the demand for consumer cloud services will expand exponentially. To meet that demand. over the next five years, we believe our white-label Personal Cloud product will transform into a personal content engagement platform that organizes and enhances a user’s digital life, creating meaningful connections between friends and family, and puts them back in control of their personal data.
With the worldwide edge computing market forecasted to reach ~$250B in 2024, emerging markets leapfrogging to 5G infrastructure, and over 50% of the world expected to have 5G coverage by 2025 we believe these factors will create a significant breeding ground for 5G-backed innovation and customer expansion. By leveraging our existing relationships with the world’s largest mobile and broadband network operators and driving increased consumption and engagement with our more than 7 million Personal Cloud user base, we believe we are uniquely positioned to be the leading global provider of white label, 5G consumer cloud engagement apps.
Competition
Competition across our markets is incredibly diverse, dynamic and nuanced in an increasingly interconnected landscape of rapidly changing technologies, evolving industry standards, new product introductions and converging spaces and services.
We face the following categories of competitors:
•OTT Service & Platform Providers - Apple, Google, Dropbox, Box, Microsoft and Amazon all provide personal cloud services closely integrated to their respective technology or service platforms.
•White Label Platform Providers - The field of platform-independent, white label personal cloud providers has consolidated in recent years with Funambol, One Drive and others competing for Operator distribution deals. However, these providers target second and third tier regional operators with low-risk, revenue share business models and do not generally pose a real threat to Tier 1 world-wide Operators.
•The emerging RCS marketplace is intensely competitive across the globe. Leading OTT device and OS platform providers, led by Google, Samsung along with prominent online platform providers such as Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram, WeChat, and LINE have created a radically new market for communication and monetization that is turning “messaging” into a new, virtual OS.
•System Integrators - Accenture, Amdocs and others engage our customers in long term contracts for services focused on digital transformation.
•CRM and BPM Providers - Major providers of CRM and other systems of record such as Salesforce, Pega Systems and Vlocity
•Telecom Expense Management (TEM) Providers - major providers of both wholesale and retail TEM software and services such as TEOCO and Tangoe.
•Telecom Service Order Management Providers - major providers of software that manage the full order lifecycle of telecommunications service orders such as Neustar. Order management applications and processes developed/utilized by Operators also present competition.
•Geospatial Network Planning Providers - major providers of software that manage the planning and design of physical communication networks such as Bentley, GE Smallworld, and 3-GIS.
To compete against global platform providers, we are compelled to maximize our natural advantages through the relationships we have with our customers and partners and the unique value we offer them: bottom line increase in revenue and margins. We believe we compete favorably across these factors and are unhindered by legacy constraints. However, some of our competitors may have greater name recognition, longer operating histories, more varied services, the ability to bundle a broader range of products and services, larger marketing budgets, established marketing relationships, access to larger user bases, major distribution agreements with hardware manufacturers and resellers, and greater financial, technical, and other resources.
Human Capital
At Synchronoss, we believe that our growth and success are attributable in large part to our diverse employee base and an experienced management team, with a mission to make Synchronoss a great place to work. We continue to invest in our employees, as well as developing and promoting our team-oriented culture, and believe that these efforts provide us with a sustainable competitive advantage.
As of December 31, 2020, we had 1,598 full-time employees located in India, North America, Europe, and Asia Pacific regions. None of our employees are covered by any collective bargaining agreements.
We have a purpose-driven culture, with a focus on employee input and well-being, which we believe enables us to attract and retain exceptional talent. We offer learning and development programs for all employees. Employees are able to actively voice their questions and thoughts through many internal channels, including our company townhall meetings and employee engagement surveys. While we have always had distributed teams collaborating around the globe, the COVID-19 pandemic provided an unexpected experiment in remote work, as the vast majority of our employees pivoted to working from home starting in March 2020. In May 2020, we announced that most employees will continue to have the option to work remotely even after we reopen our offices. This flexible location policy has unlocked opportunities to source, connect, and hire talent in more locations. We believe it will also enable us to retain talent, as employees can continue to work for Synchronoss if they need or want to relocate.
A key focus of our human capital management approach is our commitment to improving inclusion and diversity. In 2020, our focus was on building sustainable systems to champion inclusion and diversity via three critical channels - growing our
Communities program (employee resource groups), equipping our managers to build and lead inclusive teams, and making diversity a central component of our recruiting strategy.
From a total rewards perspective, Synchronoss offers a competitive compensation and benefits package, which we review and update each year. Our annual compensation planning coincides with our feedback cycle where employees and managers have performance conversations to facilitate learning and career development. As part of our compensation review program, we conduct pay equity analyses annually.

RISK FACTORS
An investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. The following are certain risk factors that could affect our business, financial results and results of operations. You should carefully consider the following risk factors in connection with evaluating the forward-looking statements contained in this Form 10-K because these factors could cause the actual results and conditions to differ materially from those projected in forward-looking statements. The risks that we have highlighted here are not the only ones that we face. If any of the risks actually occur, our business, financial condition or results of operation could be negatively affected. In that case, the trading price of our stock could decline, and our stockholders may lose part or all of their investment.
Risk Factors Summary
Our business operations are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including those outside of our control, that could cause our actual results to be harmed, including risks regarding the following:
Operation Risks
•Our business may not generate sufficient cash flows from operations or future borrowings may not be available in amounts sufficient to enable us to fund liquidity needs or capital expenditures which may impact our ability to expand our operations and invest in new products which could reduce our ability to compete.
•Our revenue, earnings and profitability are affected by the length of our sales cycle, and a longer sales cycle could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
•Fluctuations in our operating results due to certain factors make our future results difficult to predict.
•A limited number of customers account for a substantial portion of our revenues.
•Due to the global nature of our operations, political or economic changes or other factors in a specific country or region could harm our operating results and financial condition.
•Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could result in foreign currency transaction losses.
•The terms of our secured revolving credit facility require, and additional financing may require, us to meet certain operating covenants and place restrictions on our operating and financial flexibility.
•We make investments in new products and services that may not be profitable.
•We must recruit and retain our key personnel and our failure to recruit and retain qualified employees, including issues relating to immigration restrictions, could have a negative impact on our business.
•Because we recognize revenue for certain products and services ratably over the term of customer agreements and we are subject to complex revenue recognition standard, changes in the value of signed contracts will not be fully reflected in our operating results and changes in these standards may impact our business and results of operations.
•Our performance and growth depend on our ability to generate customer referrals and develop customer relationships that will enhance our sales and marketing efforts.
•Many of our products are complex and may contain defects that are detected only after deployment and if that occurs, our reputation may be harmed and may result in loss or delay in market acceptance of our products.
•Failure to maintain the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our systems, software and solutions could seriously damage our reputation and affect our ability to retain customers and attract new business.
•Consolidation in the communications industry or the other industries that we serve can reduce the number of actual and potential customers.
•Failures or interruptions of our systems and services could materially harm our revenues, impair our ability to conduct our operations and damage relationships with our customers.
•The quality of our offerings is important to our customers and failure to meet our service level obligations or otherwise fail to offer quality support and services would subject us to penalties and we could lose customers.
•Our reliance on third-party providers exposes us to a variety of risks we cannot control and interruptions or delays in our service due to problems with these third-party providers could adversely affect our business.
•We may seek to acquire or make investments in companies or technologies which could disrupt our management, dilute our stockholders’ ownership, increase our debt, and adversely affect our business.
•Economic, political, market conditions and catastrophic events can adversely affect our business.
•Downgrades in our credit ratings may increase our future borrowing costs, limit our ability to raise capital or cause our stock price to decline, any of which could have a material adverse impact on our business.
Risks Related to our Business and Industry
•The financial and operating difficulties in the telecommunications sector, including those related to the COVID-19 pandemic, may negatively affect our customers and our business.
•If we do not continue to improve our operational, financial and other internal controls and systems to manage our growth, our business could be adversely affected.
•The success of our business depends on the continued growth in demand for connected devices and the continued availability of high-speed access to the Internet.
•Our business depends on businesses adopting our products and existing customers renewing and expanding their subscriptions for our services and any decline in these would harm our operating results.
•If we fail to (i) compete successfully with existing or new competitors, (ii) adapt to rapid technological change or achieve or (iii) sustain market acceptance of our services and solutions at desired pricing levels, we could lose customers or market share, which could adversely affect our ability to sustain or grow revenue.
•We rely on strategic relationships with third parties to sell and deliver our solutions and the compatibility of our services with third party applications that our customers use.
Legal, Regulatory and Compliance Risks
•Government regulation of the Internet and e-commerce and exchange of certain information is subject to possible unfavorable changes.
•Changes in laws, regulations or governmental policy applicable to our customers or potential customers may decrease the demand for our solutions or increase our costs.
•Our expansion into new markets may be subject to uncertainties that could increase our costs to comply with foreign regulatory requirements, disrupt our operations and require increased focus from our management.
•If we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights, we could be required to incur significant expenses to enforce our rights and defend claims by others that we infringe their proprietary technology.
•We collect, process, store and use personal information and other data, and our failure to protect this information and data could damage our reputation and brand and harm our business and operating results.
•Compliance with changing data protection and privacy laws could require us to incur significant costs or experience significant business disruption.
•Our use of “open source” software could negatively affect our ability to sell our services.
•As a result of being a public company, we continue to incur significant costs and devote management time.
•Changes in tax regulations could adversely affect our effective tax rates and if we are required to collect sales taxes on the services we sell in additional jurisdictions, we may be subject to liability for past sales.
Risks Related to our Series A Preferred Stock and Common Stock
•Our Series A Preferred Stock contains covenants that may limit our business flexibility and the holders have rights that are preferential to common stockholders.
•Our stock price may continue to experience significant fluctuations and could subject us to litigation.
•The decline in the price of our securities and the restatement of our financial results has resulted in private litigation that if results in judgments against us could have a material adverse impact on our business.
•Other than payment of dividends on our Series A Preferred Stock, we have never paid dividends on our capital stock and do not anticipate paying dividends in the foreseeable future.
•Delaware law and provisions in our restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws could make a merger, tender offer or proxy contest difficult, therefore depressing the trading price of our common stock.
Operation Risks
Our business may not generate sufficient cash flows from operations, or future borrowings which may not be available to us, in amounts sufficient to enable us to fund our liquidity needs and capital expenditure requirements necessary to expand our operations and invest in new products which could reduce our ability to compete and could harm our business.
We cannot guarantee that we will be able to generate sufficient revenue or obtain enough capital to fund our planned capital expenditures and execute on our business strategy. We may be more vulnerable to adverse economic conditions than our leveraged competitors and thus less able to withstand competitive pressures. We intend to continue to make investments to support our business growth and may require additional funds to respond to business challenges, including the need to develop new products and enhancements to our platforms or acquire complementary businesses and technologies. Accordingly, we may need to engage in equity or debt financings to secure additional funds. If we raise additional equity financing, our stockholders may experience significant dilution of their ownership interests and the per share value of our common stock could decline. In addition, the terms of any future issued equity securities could entitle the holders of those equity securities to rights, preferences and privileges superior to those of holders of our common stock. Furthermore, if we engage in debt financing, the holders of
debt might have priority over the holders of common stock, and we may be required to accept terms that restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness, including restrictive covenants relating to our capital raising activities and other financial and operational matters, which may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital and to pursue business opportunities. We may also be required to take other actions that would otherwise be in the interests of the debt holders and force us to maintain specified liquidity or other ratios, any of which could harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition. If we need additional capital and cannot raise it on acceptable terms, we may not be able to, among other things, (i) develop or enhance our products and platforms, (ii) acquire complementary technologies, products or businesses, (iii) expand operations in the United States or internationally or (iv) respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated working capital requirements.
If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us when we require it, our ability to continue to support our business growth and to respond to business challenges could be significantly limited which may also require us to delay, scale back or eliminate some or all of our activities which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
Our revenue, earnings and profitability are affected by the length of our sales cycle, and a longer sales cycle could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
Our business is directly affected by the length of our sales cycles. Our customers’ businesses are relatively complex and their purchase of the types of services that we offer generally involve a significant financial commitment, with attendant delays frequently associated with large financial commitments and procurement procedures within an organization. In addition, as we continue to further penetrate the enterprise and the size and complexity of our sales opportunities continue to expand, we have seen an increase in the average length of time in our sales cycles. The purchase of the types of services that we offer typically requires coordination and agreement across many departments within a potential customer’s organization. Delays associated with such timing factors could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. In periods of economic slowdown our typical sales cycle lengthens, which means that the average time between our initial contact with a prospective customer and the signing of a sales contract increases. The lengthening of our sales cycle could reduce growth in our revenue. In addition, the lengthening of our sales cycle contributes to an increased cost of sales, thereby reducing our profitability.
We may experience quarterly fluctuations in our operating results due to a number of factors which make our future results difficult to predict and could cause our operating results to fall below expectations or our guidance.
As a result of a variety of factors discussed in this report, many of which are out of our control, our revenue for a particular quarter is difficult to predict, especially in light of a challenging and inconsistent global macroeconomic environment and related market uncertainty. Our revenue may grow at a slower rate than in past periods or decline as it has in the past on a year-over-year basis. Our ability to meet financial expectations could also be adversely affected if the nonlinear sales pattern seen in some of our past quarters recurs in future periods. The timing of large orders can also have a significant effect on our business and operating results from quarter to quarter. From time to time, we receive large orders that have a significant effect on our operating results in the period in which the order is recognized as revenue. The timing of such orders is difficult to predict, and the timing of revenue recognition from such orders may affect period to period changes in revenue. As a result, our operating results could vary materially from quarter to quarter based on the receipt of such orders and their ultimate recognition as revenue. We plan our operating expense levels based primarily on forecasted revenue levels. These expenses and the impact of long-term commitments are relatively fixed in the short term. A shortfall in revenue could lead to operating results being below expectations because we may not be able to quickly reduce these fixed expenses in response to short-term business changes. As a result, comparing our operating results on a period-to-period basis may not be meaningful. Our past results should not be relied on as an indication of our future performance. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, non-GAAP metrics we may disclose, such as EBITDA, and any corresponding trends in such metrics should not be relied on as an indication that our GAAP results, such as income (loss), will be similar or will follow the same trends. If our revenue or operating results fall below the expectations of investors or securities analysts or below any guidance we may provide to the market, the price of our common stock could decline substantially. Any of the above factors could have a material adverse impact on our operations and financial results.
If we do not meet our revenue forecasts, we may be unable to reduce our expenses in a timely fashion to avoid or minimize harm to our results of operations.
Our revenues are difficult to forecast and are likely to fluctuate significantly from period to period, particularly as we continue to implement our business strategy. We base our operating expense and capital investment budgets on expected sales and revenue trends, and many of our expenses, such as office and equipment leases and personnel costs, will be relatively fixed
in the short term and will increase over time as we make investments in our business. Our estimates of sales trends may not correlate with actual revenues in a particular quarter or over a longer period of time. Variations in the rate and timing of conversion of our sales prospects into sales and actual revenues could cause us to plan or budget inaccurately and those variations could adversely affect our financial results. In particular, delays, reductions in amount or cancellation of customers’ contracts would adversely affect the overall level and timing of our revenues, and our business, results of operations and financial condition could be harmed. Due to the relatively fixed nature of many of our expenses, we may be unable to adjust spending quickly enough to offset any unexpected revenue shortfall. In the course of our sales to customers, we may encounter difficulty collecting accounts receivable and could be exposed to risks associated with uncollectible accounts receivable. In the event we are unable to collect on our accounts receivable, it could negatively affect our cash flows, operating results and business.
We traditionally have had substantial customer concentration, with a limited number of customers accounting for a substantial portion of our revenues.
Our top five customers accounted for 68.0% of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to 69.2% of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2019. Of these customers, Verizon accounted for more than 10% of our revenues in 2020, 2019, and 2018. There are inherent risks whenever a large percentage of total revenues are concentrated with a limited number of customers. It is not possible for us to predict the future level of demand for our services that will be generated by these customers or the future demand for the products and services of these customers in the end-user marketplace. In addition, revenues from these larger customers may fluctuate from time to time based on the commencement and completion of projects, the timing of which may be affected by market conditions or other factors, some of which may be outside of our control. Further, some of our contracts with these larger customers permit them to terminate our services at any time (subject to notice and certain other provisions). If any of our major customers experience declining or delayed sales due to market, economic or competitive conditions, we could be pressured to reduce the prices we charge for our services or we could lose the customer. Any such development could have an adverse effect on our margins and financial position and would negatively affect our revenues and results of operations and/or trading price of our common stock.
We are exposed to our customers’ credit risk.
We are subject to the credit risk of our customers and customers with liquidity issues may lead to credit losses for us. Most of our sales are on an open credit basis, with typical payment terms between 45 and 60 days in the United States and, because of local customs or conditions, longer payment terms in some markets outside the United States. We use various methods to screen potential customers and establish appropriate credit limits, but these methods cannot eliminate all potential bad credit risks and may not prevent us from approving applications that are fraudulently completed. Moreover, businesses that are good credit risks at the time of application may become bad credit risks over time and we may fail to detect this change. We maintain reserves we believe are adequate to cover exposure for doubtful accounts. If we fail to adequately assess and monitor our credit risks, we could experience longer payment cycles, increased collection costs and higher bad debt expense. A decrease in accounts receivable resulting from an increase in bad debt expense could adversely affect our liquidity. Our exposure to credit risks may increase if our customers are adversely affected by a difficult macroeconomic environment, or if there is a continuation or worsening of the economic environment. Although we have programs in place that are designed to monitor and mitigate the associated risk, including monitoring of particular risks in certain geographic areas, there can be no assurance, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, that these programs will be effective in reducing our credit risks or preventing us from incurring additional losses. Future losses, if incurred, could harm our business and have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition. Additionally, to the degree that the current or future credit markets makes it more difficult for some customers to obtain financing, those customers’ ability to pay could be adversely impacted, which in turn could have a material adverse impact on our business, operating results, and financial condition.
Due to the global nature of our operations, political or economic changes or other factors in a specific country or region could harm our operating results and financial condition.
We conduct significant sales and customer support operations in countries around the world. As such, our growth depends in part on our increasing sales into emerging countries. We also depend on, and many of our customers depend on, non-U.S. operations of our contract manufacturers, component suppliers and distribution partners. Emerging countries in the aggregate experienced a decline in orders during fiscal 2020 and certain prior periods. We continue to assess the sustainability of any improvements in these countries and there can be no assurance that our investments in these countries will be successful. Our future results could be materially adversely affected by a variety of political, economic or other factors relating to our operations inside and outside the United States, including impacts from global central bank monetary policy; issues related to the political relationship between the United States and other countries that can affect the willingness of customers in those countries to purchase products from companies headquartered in the United States; the impact of the COVID-19 or other public
health epidemics or concerns on our customer’s component suppliers, and the challenging and inconsistent global macroeconomic environment, any or all of which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition, including, among others things:
•Foreign currency exchange rates;
•Political or social unrest;
•Economic instability or weakness or natural disasters in a specific country or region, including the current economic or health challenges in China and global economic ramifications of Chinese economic difficulties; or instability as a result of Brexit;
•Environmental and trade protection measures and other legal and regulatory requirements, some of which may affect our ability to import our products, to export our products from, or sell our products in various countries;
•Political considerations that affect service provider and government spending patterns;
•Health or similar issues and the responses thereto, such as a pandemic or epidemic, including the COVID-19 pandemic and responses taken thereto;
•Difficulties in staffing and managing international operations; or
•Adverse tax consequences, including imposition of withholding or other taxes on our global operations.
Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could result in foreign currency transaction losses, which could harm our operating results and financial condition.
We consider the U.S. dollar to be our functional currency. However, given our international operations we currently have, and expect to have in the future, revenue and expenses and related assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies. Foreign currency transaction exposure results primarily from transactions with customers or vendors denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the entity in which we record the transaction. Any fluctuation in the exchange rate of these foreign currencies may positively or negatively affect our business and operating results. We face exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates due to the fact that we have non-U.S. dollar denominated revenue worldwide. Weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar adversely affects the U.S. dollar value of our foreign currency denominated revenue and positively affects the U.S. dollar value of our foreign currency denominated expenses. If foreign currencies were to weaken or strengthen relative to the U.S. dollar, we might elect to raise or lower our international pricing, which could potentially impact demand for our services. Alternatively, we might opt not to adjust our international pricing as a result of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, which could potentially have a positive or negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition. Similarly, our financial performance may be impacted by fluctuations in currency exchange rates when it comes to our non-U.S. dollar denominated expenses. The third-party vendors and suppliers to whom we owe payments for non-U.S. dollar denominated expenses may or may not decide to adjust their pricing to reflect fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. If there continues to be volatility in foreign currency exchange rates, we will continue to experience fluctuations in our operating results due to revaluing our assets and liabilities that are not denominated in the functional currency of the entity that recorded the asset or liability, and the translation of our non-U.S. denominated revenue and expenses into U.S. dollars may affect the year-over-year comparability of our operating results.
The terms of our secured revolving credit facility require us to meet certain operating covenants and place restrictions on our operating and financial flexibility. If we raise additional capital through debt financing, the terms of any new debt could further restrict our ability to operate our business.
In October 2019, we entered into a revolving credit facility with Citizens Bank, N.A. that is secured by a lien covering substantially all of our assets, other than our existing real property. The revolving credit facility contains customary covenants that limit the ability of our company and our restricted subsidiaries to, among other things, (1) incur additional indebtedness, (2) pay dividends or make certain other restricted payments, (3) sell assets, (4) make certain investments and (5) grant liens. These covenants are subject to exceptions and qualifications set forth in the credit agreement. The financial covenants set forth in the credit agreement include a maximum consolidated total leverage ratio and a minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio, each of which will be tested at the end of each fiscal quarter. If we default under the terms of the revolving credit facility or any future debt facility, the lender may accelerate all of our repayment obligations and take control of our pledged assets, potentially requiring us to renegotiate our agreement on terms less favorable to us or to immediately cease operations. Further, if we are liquidated, the lender’s right to repayment would be senior to the rights of the holders of our common stock. The lender could declare a default upon the occurrence of any event that they interpret as a material adverse effect as defined under the loan agreement. Any declaration by the lender of an event of default could significantly harm our business and prospects and could cause the price of our common stock to decline. If we raise any additional debt financing, the terms of such additional debt could further restrict our operating and financial flexibility.
We make investments in new products and services that may not be profitable or align with our company vision.
We intend to continue to make investments to support our business growth, including expenditures to develop new services or enhance our existing services, enhance our operating infrastructure, market and sell our product offerings and acquire complementary businesses and technologies. These endeavors may involve significant risks and uncertainties, including failures to align new initiatives with our established corporate vision and direction, which could lead to a misapplication of our resources. These new investments are inherently risky and may involve distracting management from current operations, create greater than expected liabilities and expenses, provide us with an inadequate return on capital, include other unidentified risks and, ultimately, may generally not be successful. Further, our ability to effectively integrate new services and investments into our business may affect our profitability. Significant delays in new releases or significant problems in creating new products or services could adversely affect our revenue and financial performance.
We must recruit and retain our key management and other key personnel and our failure to recruit and retain qualified employees could have a negative impact on our business.
We believe that our success depends in part on the continued contributions of our senior management and other key personnel to generate business and execute programs successfully. In addition, the relationships and reputation that these individuals have established and maintain with our customers and within the industries in which we operate contribute to our ability to maintain good relations with our customers and others within those industries. The loss of any members of senior management or other key personnel could materially impair our ability to identify and secure new contracts and otherwise effectively manage our business. In order to attract and retain executives and other key employees in a competitive marketplace, we must provide a competitive compensation package, including cash- and equity-based compensation. If we do not obtain the stockholder approval needed to continue granting equity compensation in a competitive manner, our ability to attract, retain, and motivate executives and key employees could be weakened. Further, in the technology industry, there is substantial and continuous competition for highly skilled business, product development, technical and other personnel. Competition for qualified personnel at times can be intense and as a result we may not be successful in attracting and retaining the personnel we require, which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to meet our commitments and new product delivery objectives. If we are unable to maintain or expand our direct sales capabilities, we may not be able to generate anticipated revenues. In addition, if we are unable to maintain or expand our product development capabilities, we may not be able to meet our product development goals. Further, we rely on the expertise and experience of our senior management team. Although we have employment agreements with our executive officers, none of them or any of our other management personnel is obligated to remain employed by us. The loss of services of any key management personnel could lower productive output, interrupt our strategic vision and make it more difficult to pursue our business goals successfully.
Our employee retention and hiring may be adversely impacted by immigration restrictions and related factors
Competition for skilled personnel is intense in our industry and any failure on our part to hire and retain appropriately skilled employees could harm our business. Our ability to hire and retain skilled employees is impacted, at least in part, by the fact that a portion of our professional workforce in the United States is comprised of foreign nationals who are not United States citizens. In order to be legally allowed to work for us, these individuals generally hold immigrant visas (which may or may not be tied to their employment with us) or green cards, the latter of which makes them permanent residents in the United States. The ability of these foreign nationals to remain and work in the United States is impacted by a variety of laws and regulations, as well as the processing procedures of various government agencies. Changes in applicable laws, regulations or procedures could adversely affect our ability to hire or retain these skilled employees and could affect our costs of doing business and our ability to deliver services to our customers. In addition, if the laws, rules or procedures governing the ability of foreign nationals to work in the United States were to change or if the number of visas available for foreign nationals permitted to work in the United States were to be reduced, our business could be adversely affected, if, for example, we were unable to hire or no longer able to retain a skilled worker who is a foreign national. Employing foreign nationals may require significant time and expense and our foreign national employees may choose to leave after we have made this investment. While a foreign national who is working under an immigrant visa tied to his or her employment by us may be less likely to choose to leave our Company than a similarly situated employee who is a United States national or a green card holder (as leaving our employ could mean also having to leave the United States), this may not always be the case. Additionally, many of our foreign national employees hold green cards, which means that they have greater flexibility to leave our Company without facing the risk of also having to leave the United States.
We are subject to revenue recognitions standards and because we recognize revenue for certain products and services ratably over the term of customer agreements upturns or downturns in the value of signed contracts will not be fully and immediately reflected in our operating results and any changes in the standards could impact our business.
We offer certain of our products and services primarily through fixed or variable commitment contracts and recognize revenue ratably over the related service period, which typically ranges from twelve to twenty-four months. As a result, some portion of the revenue we report in each quarter is revenue from contracts entered into during prior periods. Consequently, a decline in signed contracts in any quarter will not be fully and immediately reflected in revenue for that quarter but may instead negatively affect our revenue in future quarters. In addition, we may be unable to adjust our cost structure to offset this reduced revenue. Similarly, revenue attributable to an increase in contracts signed in a particular quarter will not be fully and immediately recognized, as revenue from new or renewed contracts is recognized ratably over the applicable service period. Because we incur certain sales costs at the time of sale, we may not recognize revenues from some customers despite incurring considerable expense related to our sales processes. Timing differences of this nature could cause our margins and profitability to fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter. As we introduce new services or products, revenue recognition could become increasingly complex and require additional analysis and judgment. Additionally, for new contracts with existing customers, we may negotiate and revise previously used terms and conditions of our contracts with these customers and channel partners, which may also cause us to revise our revenue recognition policies. As our arrangements with customers change, we may be required to defer a greater portion of revenue into future periods, which could materially and adversely affect our financial results.
Our performance and growth depend on our ability to generate customer referrals and to develop referenceable customer relationships that will enhance our sales and marketing efforts. A failure to accomplish these objectives could materially harm our business.
In our business, we depend on end-users of our solutions to generate customer referrals for our services. We also depend on members of the communications industry, financial institutions, legal service providers and other third parties who use our services to recommend them to a larger customer base than we can reach through our direct sales and internal marketing efforts. These referrals are an important source of new customers for our services and generally are made without expectation of compensation. We intend to continue to focus our marketing efforts on these referral partners in order to expand our reach and improve the efficiency of our sales efforts. We also recognize that having respected, well known, market-leading customers who have committed to deploy our solutions within their organizations will support our marketing and sales efforts, as these customers can act as references for us and our product offerings. Our ability to establish and maintain these customer relationships is important to our future profitability. The willingness of these types of customers to provide referrals or serve as anchor or reference customers depends on a number of factors, including the performance, ease of use, reliability, reputation and cost-effectiveness of our services as compared to those offered by our competitors, as well as the internal policies of these customers. We may not be able to cultivate or maintain the relationships with customers that are necessary to develop those customer relationships into referenceable accounts.
The loss of any of our significant referral sources, including our anchor customers, or a decline in the number of referrals we receive or anchor customers that we generate could require us to devote substantially more resources to the sales and marketing of our services, which would increase our costs, potentially lead to a decline in our revenue, slow our growth and generally have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, the revenue we generate from our referral and anchor relationships may vary from period to period.
Many of our current and planned products are highly complex and may contain defects or errors that are detected only after deployment in telecommunications networks. If that occurs, our reputation may be harmed.
Our products are highly complex, and we cannot assure customers that our extensive product development, production and integration testing is, or will be, adequate to detect all defects, errors, failures and quality issues that could affect customer satisfaction or result in claims against us. As a result, we might have to replace certain components and/or provide remediation in response to the discovery of defects in products that have been supplied to customers. The occurrence of any defects, errors, failures or quality issues could result in cancellation of orders, product returns, diversion of our resources, legal actions by customers or customers’ end users and other losses to us or to our customers or end users. These occurrences could also result in the loss of or delay in market acceptance of our products, in the loss of sales, or in the need to create provisions, which would harm our business and adversely affect our revenues and profitability.
Failure to maintain the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our systems, software and solutions could seriously damage our reputation and affect our ability to retain customers and attract new business.
Maintaining the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our systems, software and solutions is an issue of critical importance for us and for our customers and users who rely on our systems to store and exchange large volumes of information, much of which is proprietary and confidential. There appears to be an increasing number of individuals, governments, groups and computer “hackers” developing and deploying a variety of destructive software programs (such as viruses, worms and other malicious software) that could attack our computer systems or solutions or attempt to infiltrate our systems. We make significant efforts to maintain the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our systems, solutions and source code. Despite significant efforts to create security barriers, it is virtually impossible for us to mitigate this risk entirely because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target. Like all software solutions, our software is vulnerable to these types of attacks. An attack of this type could disrupt the proper functioning of our software solutions, cause errors in the output of our customers’ work, allow unauthorized access to sensitive, proprietary or confidential information of ours or our customers and other destructive outcomes. If an actual or perceived breach of our security were to occur, our reputation could suffer, customers could stop buying our solutions and we could face lawsuits and potential liability, any of which could cause our financial performance to be negatively impacted. Though we maintain professional liability insurance that may be available to provide coverage if a cybersecurity incident were to occur, there can be no assurance that insurance coverage will be available or that available coverage will be sufficient to cover losses and claims related to any cybersecurity incidents we may experience.
There is also a danger of industrial espionage, cyber-attacks, misuse or theft of information or assets (including source code), or damage to assets by people who have gained unauthorized access to our facilities, systems or information, which could lead to the disclosure of portions of our source code or other confidential information, improper usage and distribution of our solutions without compensation, illegal or inappropriate usage of our systems and solutions, jeopardizing of the security of information stored in and transmitted through our computer systems, manipulation and destruction of data, defects in our software and downtime issues. More generally, the COVID-19 pandemic has increased attack opportunities available to criminals, as they attempt to profit from disruptions and the resulting shift in companies and individuals working remotely and online, as well as the increase in electronic payments, e-commerce, and other online activity. As such, the risk of cybersecurity incidents is increasing, and we cannot provide assurances that our preventative efforts will be successful. Although we actively employ measures to combat unlicensed copying, access and use of our facilities, systems, software and intellectual property through a variety of techniques, preventing unauthorized use or infringement of our rights is inherently difficult. The occurrence of an event of this nature could adversely affect our financial results or could result in significant claims against us for damages. Further, participating in either a lawsuit to protect against unauthorized access to, usage of or disclosure of any of our solutions or any portion of our source code or the prosecution of an individual in connection with a cybersecurity breach could be costly and time-consuming and could divert management’s attention and adversely affect the market’s perception of us and our solutions. A number of core processes, such as software development, sales and marketing, customer service and financial transactions, rely on our IT, infrastructure and applications. Defects or malfunctions in our IT infrastructure and applications could cause our service offerings not to perform as our customers expect, which could harm our reputation and business. In addition, malicious software, sabotage and other cybersecurity breaches of the types described above could cause an outage of our infrastructure, which could lead to a substantial denial of service and ultimately downtimes, recovery costs and customer claims, any of which could have a significant negative impact on our business, financial position, profit and cash flows.
The confidentiality, integrity and availability of our systems could also be jeopardized by a breach of our internal controls and policies by our employees, consultants or subcontractors having access to our systems. If our systems fail or are breached as a result of a third-party attack or an error, violation of internal controls or policies or a breach of contract by an employee, consultant or subcontractor that results in the unauthorized use or disclosure of proprietary or confidential information or customer data (including information about the existence and nature of the projects and transactions our customers are engaged in), we could lose business, suffer irreparable damage to our reputation and incur significant costs and expenses relating to the investigation and possible litigation of claims relating to such event. We could be liable for damages, penalties for violation of applicable laws or regulations and costs for remediation and efforts to prevent future occurrences, any of which liabilities could be significant. There can be no assurance that the limitations of liability in our contracts would be enforceable or adequate or would otherwise protect us from liabilities or damages with respect to any particular claim. We also cannot assure that our existing general liability insurance coverage, coverage for errors and omissions and cyber liability insurance will continue to be available on acceptable terms in sufficient amounts to cover one or more large claims, or that the insurer will not deny coverage as to any future claim. The successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceeds our available insurance coverage, or the occurrence of changes in our insurance policies, including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or co-insurance requirements, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, litigation, regardless of its outcome, could result in a substantial cost to us and divert management’s
attention from our operations. Any significant claim against us or litigation involving us could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
We have implemented a number of security measures designed to ensure the security of our information, IT resources and other assets. Nonetheless, unauthorized users could gain access to our systems through cyber-attacks and steal, use without authorization and sabotage our intellectual property and confidential data. Any security breach, misuse of our IT systems or theft of our or our customers’ intellectual property or data could lead to customer losses, non-renewal of customer agreements, loss of production, recovery costs or litigation brought by customers or business partners, any of which could adversely impact our cash flows and reputation and could have an adverse impact on our disclosure controls and procedures.
Consolidation in the communications industry or the other industries that we serve can reduce the number of actual and potential customers and adversely affect our business.
There has been, and there continues to be, merger, acquisition and consolidation activity among our customers. Mergers, acquisitions or consolidations of companies in the communications industry or other industries that we serve, have reduced and may continue to reduce the number of our customers and potential customers for our solutions, resulting in a smaller market for our services, which could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations. In addition, it is possible that the larger institutions that result from mergers or consolidations could themselves perform some or all of the services that we currently provide or could provide in the future. Should one or more of our significant customers acquire, consolidate or enter into an alliance with an entity or decide to either use a different service provider or to manage its transactions internally, this could have a negative material impact on our business. Any such consolidations, alliances or decisions to manage transactions internally may cause us to lose customers or require us to reduce prices as a result of enhanced customer leverage, which would have a material adverse effect on our business. We may not be able to offset the effects of any price reductions. We may not be able to expand our customer base to make up any revenue declines if we lose customers or if our transaction volumes decline.
Failures or interruptions of our systems and services could materially harm our revenues, impair our ability to conduct our operations and damage relationships with our customers.
Our success depends on our ability to provide reliable services to our customers and process a high volume of transactions in a timely and effective manner. Although we operate disaster recovery solutions, our network operations are susceptible to damage or interruption from human error, fire, flood, power loss, telecommunications failure, terrorist attacks and similar events. We could also experience failures or interruptions of our systems and services, or other problems in connection with our operations, as a result of, among other things:
•damage to, or failure of, our computer software or hardware or our connections and outsourced service arrangements with third parties;
•errors in the processing of data by our systems;
•computer viruses or software defects;
•physical or electronic break-ins, sabotage, intentional acts of vandalism and similar events;
•fire, cybersecurity attack, terrorist attack or other catastrophic event;
•increased capacity demands or changes in systems requirements of our customers; or
•errors by our employees or third-party service providers.
We rely on various systems and applications to support our internal operations, including our billing, financial reporting and customer contracting functions. The availability of these systems and applications is essential to us and delays, disruptions or performance problems may adversely impact our ability to accurately bill our customers, report financial information and conduct our business. Additionally, we may choose to replace or implement changes to these systems, including substituting traditional systems with cloud-based solutions, which could be time-consuming and expensive, and which could result in delays in the ongoing operational processes these software solutions support. Further, our cloud-based solutions may experience disruptions and outages that are beyond our control as we rely on third-party vendors to support these solutions and assure their continued availability. We have also acquired a number of companies, products, services and technologies over the last several years. While we make significant efforts to address any IT security issues with respect to our acquisitions, we may still inherit certain risks when we integrate these acquisitions. In addition, our business interruption insurance may be insufficient to compensate us for losses or liabilities that may occur. Any interruptions in our systems or services could damage our reputation and substantially harm our business and results of operations.
Undetected errors or failures found in our products and services may result in loss of or delay in market acceptance of our products and services that could seriously harm our business.
Our products and services may contain undetected errors or scalability limitations at any point in their lives, but particularly when first introduced or as new versions are released. We frequently release new versions of our products and different aspects of our platforms are in various stages of development. Despite testing by us and by current and potential customers, errors may not be found in new products and services until after commencement of commercial availability or use, resulting in a loss of or a delay in market acceptance, damage to our reputation, customer dissatisfaction and reductions in revenues and margins, any of which could seriously harm our business. Additionally, our agreements with customers that attempt to limit our exposure to liability claims may not be enforceable in jurisdictions where we operate, particularly in certain markets outside the United States.
The quality of our support and services offerings is important to our customers and if we fail to meet our service level obligations under our service level agreements or otherwise fail to offer quality support and services, we would be subject to penalties and could lose customers.
Our customers generally depend on our service organization to resolve issues relating to the use of our solutions. A high level of support is critical for the successful marketing and sale of our solutions. If we are unable to provide a level of support and service to meet or exceed the expectations of our customers, we could experience (i) loss of customers and market share; (ii) difficulty attracting or the inability to attract new customers, including in new geographic regions; and (iii) increased service and support costs and a diversion of resources.
Any of the above results would likely have a material adverse impact on our business, revenue, results of operations, financial condition and reputation. In addition, we have service level agreements with many of our customers under which we guarantee specified levels of service availability. These arrangements involve the risk that we may not have adequately estimated the level of service we will in fact be able to provide. The importance of high-quality customer support will increase as we expand our business and pursue new enterprise customers. If we fail to meet our service level obligations under these agreements, we would be subject to penalties, which could result in higher than expected costs, decreased revenues and decreased operating margins. We could also lose customers.
Our reliance on third-party providers for communications software, services, hardware and infrastructure exposes us to a variety of risks we cannot control.
Our success depends on software, equipment, network connectivity and infrastructure hosting services supplied by, or leased from, our vendors and customers. In addition, we rely on third-party vendors to perform a substantial portion of our exception handling services. We may not be able to continue to purchase the necessary software, equipment and services from vendors on acceptable terms or at all. If we are unable to maintain current purchasing terms or ensure service availability with these vendors and customers, we may lose customers and experience an increase in costs in seeking alternative supplier services. Further, any changes in our third-party vendors could detract from management’s ability to focus on the ongoing operations of our business or could cause delays in the operations of our business. Our business also depends upon the capacity, reliability and security of the infrastructure owned and managed by third parties, including our vendors and customers that are used by our technology interoperability services, network services, number portability services, call processed services and enterprise solutions. We have no control over the operation, quality or maintenance of a significant portion of that infrastructure and whether those third parties will upgrade or improve their software, equipment and services to meet our and our customers’ evolving requirements. We depend on these companies to maintain the operational integrity of our services. If one or more of these companies is unable or unwilling to supply or expand its levels of services to us in the future, our operations could be severely interrupted. In addition, rapid changes in the communications industry have led to industry consolidation. This consolidation may cause the availability, pricing and quality of the services we use to vary and could lengthen the amount of time it takes to deliver the services that we use.
Any damage to, or failure or capacity limitations of, our systems and our related network could result in interruptions in our service that could cause us to lose revenue, issue credits or refunds or could cause our customers to terminate their subscriptions for our services, in each case adversely affecting our renewal rates. Since our customers use our service for important aspects of their businesses, any errors, defects, disruptions in service or other performance problems could hurt our reputation and may damage our customers’ businesses. As a result, we may lose revenue, issue credits or refunds or customers could elect not to renew our services or delay or withhold payments to us. We could also lose future sales or customers may make claims against us, which could result in an increase in our provision for doubtful accounts, an increase in collection cycles for accounts receivable or the expense or risk of litigation. Additionally, third-party software underlying our services can contain undetected errors or bugs. We may be forced to delay commercial release of our services until any discovered problems
are corrected and, in some cases, may need to implement enhancements or modifications to correct errors that we do not detect until after deployment of our services. In addition, problems with the third-party software underlying our services could result in (i) damage to our reputation, (ii) loss of or customers or delayed revenue, (iii) warranty claims or litigation, (iv) loss of or delayed market acceptance of our services or (v) unexpected expenses and diversion of resources to remedy errors.
Interruptions or delays in our service due to problems with our third-party web hosting facilities or other third-party service providers could adversely affect our business.
We rely on third parties for the maintenance of certain of the equipment running our solutions and software at geographically dispersed hosting facilities with third parties. If we are unable to renew, extend or replace our agreements with any of our third-party hosting facilities, we may be unable to arrange for replacement services at a similar cost and in a timely manner, which could cause an interruption in our service. We do not control the operation of these third-party facilities, each of which may be subject to damage or interruption from earthquakes, floods, fires, power loss, telecommunications failures or similar events. These facilities may also be subject to break-ins, sabotage, intentional acts of vandalism or similar misconduct. Despite precautions taken at these facilities, the occurrence of a natural disaster, cessation of operations by our third-party web hosting provider or a third party’s decision to close a facility without adequate notice or other unanticipated problems at any facility could result in lengthy interruptions in our service. In addition, the failure by these facilities to provide our required data communications capacity could result in interruptions in our service.
We may seek to acquire companies or technologies, form joint ventures or make investments in other companies or technologies, which could disrupt our ongoing business, disrupt our management and employees, dilute our stockholders’ ownership, increase our debt, and adversely affect our results of operations.
We have made, and in the future intend to form joint ventures, make acquisitions of and investments in companies, technologies or products in existing, related or new markets for us that we believe may enhance our market position or strategic strengths. However, we cannot be sure that any acquisition or investment will ultimately enhance our products or strengthen our competitive position. Acquisitions involve numerous risks, including but not limited to:
•diversion of management’s attention from other operational matters;
•inability to identify acquisition candidates on terms acceptable to us or at all, or inability to complete acquisitions as anticipated or at all;
•inability to realize anticipated benefits or commercialize purchased technologies;
•exposure to operational risks, rules and regulations to the extent such activities are located in countries where we have not historically done business;
•unknown, underestimated and/or undisclosed commitments or liabilities;
•incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities or future write-offs of intangible assets or goodwill;
•dilution of ownership of our current stockholders if we issue shares of our common stock;
•higher than expected transaction costs; and
•ineffective integration of operations, technologies, products or employees of the acquired companies.
In addition, acquisitions may disrupt our ongoing operations, increase our expenses and/or harm our results of operations or financial condition. Future acquisitions could also result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities, the incurrence of debt (which may reduce our cash available for operations and other uses), an increase in contingent liabilities or an increase in amortization expense related to identifiable assets acquired, each of which could materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Economic, political & market conditions can adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition & business
Our business is influenced by a range of factors that are beyond our control and that we have no comparative advantage in forecasting. These include but are not limited to general economic and business conditions, the overall demand for cloud-based products and services, general political developments and currency exchange rate fluctuations. Economic uncertainty may exacerbate negative trends in consumer spending and may negatively impact the businesses of certain of our customers, which may cause a reduction in their use of our platforms or increase the likelihood of defaulting on their payment obligations, and therefore cause a reduction in our revenues. These conditions and uncertainty about future economic conditions may make it challenging for us to forecast our operating results, make business decisions and identify the risks that may affect our business, financial conditions and results of operations and may result in a more competitive environment, resulting in possible pricing pressures. Our business could be affected by acts of war, terrorism, natural disasters and the widespread outbreak of infectious diseases. Current world tensions could escalate, and this could have unpredictable consequences on the world economy and on our business.
The COVID-19 pandemic has created significant uncertainty in the global economy. The COVID-19 pandemic and health measures taken by governments and private industry in response to the pandemic, including stay-at-home orders, restrictions on business operations, and travel restrictions, have had significant negative effects on the economy. Continued uncertainty about the pandemic, associated economic consequences, and potential relief measures may have a long-term adverse effect on the economy, our sellers, customers, suppliers, and our business. For example, we are currently subletting some of our office space. An economic downturn or our new work from home practices may cause us to need less office space than we are contractually committed to leasing and prevent us from finding subtenants for such unused office space, causing us to pay for unused office space. We are also monitoring developments related to the United Kingdom leaving the European Union. Brexit could have significant implications for our business and could lead to economic and legal uncertainty and increasingly divergent laws, regulations, and licensing requirements. Any of these effects of Brexit, among others, could adversely affect our operations and financial results. These or any further political or governmental developments or health concerns in countries could result in social, economic and labor instability. If, as a result of such events, we experience a reduction in demand for our products, platforms or services, or the supply of products or components to our customers, our business, results of operations and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected.
Downgrades in our credit ratings may increase our future borrowing costs, limit our ability to raise capital, cause our stock price to decline or reduce analyst coverage, any of which could have a material adverse impact on our business.
Credit rating agencies review their ratings periodically and, therefore, the credit rating assigned to us by each of the rating agencies may be subject to revision at any time. Factors that can affect our credit ratings include changes in our operating performance, the economic environment, our financial position, conditions in and periods of disruption in any of our principal markets and changes in our business strategy. If weak financial market conditions or competitive dynamics cause any of these factors to deteriorate, we could see a reduction in our corporate credit rating. Since investors, analysts and financial institutions often rely on credit ratings to assess a company’s creditworthiness and risk profile, make investment decisions and establish threshold requirements for investment guidelines, our ability to raise capital, our access to external financing, our stock price and analyst coverage of our stock could be negatively impacted by a downgrade to our credit rating.
Catastrophic events may disrupt our business.
A natural disaster, telecommunications failure, power outage, cybersecurity attack, war, terrorist attack, health epidemic or pandemic or other catastrophic event could cause us to suffer system interruptions, reputational harm, delays in product development, lack of products provided to our customers, breaches of data security and loss of critical data. An event of this nature could also prevent us from fulfilling customer orders or maintaining certain service level requirements, particularly in respect of our SaaS and hosted offerings. While we have developed certain disaster recovery plans and maintain backup systems to reduce the potentially adverse effect of these types of events, a catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our data centers or our critical business or information technology systems could severely affect our ability to conduct normal business operations and, as a result, our business, operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected.
Risks Related to Our Business and Industry
The financial and operating difficulties in the telecommunications sector may negatively affect our customers and our company.
The telecommunications sector has at times faced significant challenges resulting from significant changes in technology and consumer behavior, excess capacity, poor operating results and financing difficulties. The sector’s financial status has also at times been uncertain and access to debt and equity capital has been seriously limited. The impact of these events on us could include slower collection on accounts receivable, higher bad debt expense, uncertainties due to possible customer bankruptcies, lower pricing on new customer contracts, lower revenues due to lower usage by the end customer and possible consolidation among our customers, which will put our customers and operating performance at risk. In addition, because we operate in the communications sector, we may also be negatively impacted by limited access to debt and equity capital.
The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and measures intended to prevent its spread may have a material and adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
Global health concerns relating to the COVID-19 pandemic and related government actions taken to reduce the spread of the virus have been weighing on the macroeconomic environment, and the pandemic has significantly increased economic uncertainty and reduced economic activity. The pandemic has resulted in government authorities and businesses implementing
numerous measures to try to contain the virus, such as travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter in place or total lock-down orders, school closures, and business limitations and shutdowns. As a result, our supply chain, financial condition, revenues, profitability and cash flows could be adversely affected.
The pandemic has caused us to modify our business practices to help minimize the risk of the virus to our employees, our customers, and the communities in which we participate, which could negatively impact our business. These measures include temporarily requiring employees to work remotely, suspending all non-essential business travel for our employees, limiting external guests visiting our offices, and canceling, postponing, or holding meetings and events virtually. Given the continually evolving situation, there is no certainty that the measures we have taken will be sufficient to mitigate the risks posed by the virus.
The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts our business, results of operations, and financial condition will depend on developments that continue to be highly uncertain and difficult to predict, including, but not limited to, the duration and spread of the pandemic, its severity, the actions to contain the virus or treat its impact, the availability, distribution and efficacy of vaccines, and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume. Even after the COVID-19 pandemic has subsided, we may experience material and adverse impacts to our business as a result of the virus’s global economic impact, including the availability of credit, bankruptcies or insolvencies of customers, and recession or economic downturn.
There are no comparable recent events that provide guidance as to the effect the COVID-19 pandemic may have, and, as a result, the ultimate impact of the pandemic is highly uncertain and subject to change. We do not yet know the full extent of the impacts on our business, our operations, or the global economy as a whole. However, the effects could have a material impact on our results of operations and heighten many of the known risks described throughout this Risk Factors section.
If we do not continue to improve our operational, financial and other internal controls and systems to manage our growth and size, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.
Our historic and anticipated growth will continue to place significant demands on our management and other resources and will require us to continue to develop and improve our operational, financial and other internal controls. In particular, our growth will increase the challenges involved in:
•recruiting, training and retaining technical, finance, marketing and management personnel with the knowledge, skills and experience that our business model requires;
•maintaining high levels of customer satisfaction;
•developing and improving our internal administrative infrastructure, particularly our financial, operational, communications and other internal systems;
•preserving our culture, values and entrepreneurial environment; and
•effectively managing our personnel and operations and effectively communicating to our personnel worldwide our core values, strategies and goals.
In addition, the increasing size and scope of our operations increase the possibility that a member of our personnel will engage in unlawful or fraudulent activity, breach our contractual obligations, or otherwise expose us to unacceptable business risks, despite our efforts to train our people and maintain internal controls to prevent such instances. If we do not continue to develop and implement the right processes and tools to manage our enterprise, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.
The success of our business depends on the continued growth in demand for connected devices and the continued availability of high-speed access to the Internet.
The future success of our business depends upon the continued growth in demand for connected devices and business transactions on the Internet, and on our customers having high-speed access to the Internet, as well as the continued maintenance and development of the Internet infrastructure. While we believe the market for connected devices will continue to grow for the foreseeable future, we cannot accurately predict the extent to which demand for connected devices will increase, if at all. In particular, the current COVID-19 pandemic has caused disruptions in various supply chains. If the demand for connected devices were to slow down or decline or the supply of connected devices to our customers is impacted for any reason, such as COVID-19 or other public health epidemics or concerns, our business and results of operations may be adversely affected. If for any reason the Internet does not remain a widespread communications medium and commercial platform, the demand for our services would be significantly reduced, which would harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. To the extent the Internet continues to experience increased numbers of users, frequency of use or
bandwidth requirements, the Internet may become congested and be unable to support the demands placed on it, and its performance or reliability may decline. Any future Internet outages or delays could adversely affect our business, results of operation and financial condition.
Our business growth would be impeded if the performance or perception of the Internet was harmed by security problems such as “viruses,” “worms” or other malicious programs, reliability issues arising from outages and damage to Internet infrastructure, delays in development or adoption of new standards and protocols to handle increased demands of Internet activity, increased costs, decreased accessibility and quality of service, or increased government regulation and taxation of Internet activity. The Internet has experienced, and is expected to continue to experience, significant user and traffic growth, which has, at times, caused user frustration with slow access and download times. If Internet activity grows faster than Internet infrastructure or if the Internet infrastructure is otherwise unable to support the demands placed on it, or if hosting capacity becomes scarce, the growth of our business and operating results may be adversely affected.
Our business depends substantially on customers renewing and expanding their subscriptions for our services. Any decline in our customer renewals and expansions would harm our future operating results.
We enter into subscription agreements with certain of our customers that are generally one to two years. As a result, maintaining the renewal rate of those subscription agreements is critical to our future success. We cannot provide assurance that any of our customer agreements will be renewed, as our customers have no obligation to renew their subscriptions for our services after the expiration of the initial term of their agreements. The loss of any customers that individually or collectively account for a significant amount of our revenues would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. If our renewal rates are lower than anticipated or decline for any reason, or if customers renew on terms less favorable to us, our revenue may decrease, and our profitability and gross margin may be harmed, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
If we fail to compete successfully with existing or new competitors, our business could be harmed.
If we fail to compete successfully with established or new competitors, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. The industries in which we operate are highly competitive and fragmented, and we expect competition to increase. We compete with independent providers of information systems and services and with the in-house departments of our OEMs and communications services companies’ customers. Rapid technological changes, such as advancements in software integration across multiple and incompatible systems, and economies of scale may make it more economical for CSPs, MSOs or OEMs to develop their own in-house processes and systems, which may render some of our products and services less valuable or, eventually, obsolete. Our competitors include firms that provide comprehensive information systems and managed services solutions, BYOD providers, systems integrators, clearinghouses and service bureaus. Many of our competitors have long operating histories, large customer bases, substantial financial, technical, sales, marketing and other resources and strong name recognition.
Current and potential competitors have established, and may establish in the future, cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties to increase their ability to address the needs of our current or prospective customers. In addition, our competitors have acquired, and may continue to acquire in the future, companies that may enhance their market offerings. Accordingly, new competitors or alliances among competitors may emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share. As a result, our competitors may be able to adapt more quickly than us to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements and may be able to devote greater resources to the promotion and sale of their products. These relationships and alliances may also result in transaction pricing pressure, which could result in large reductions in the selling prices of our products and services. Our competitors or our customers’ in-house solutions may also provide services at a lower cost, significantly increasing pricing pressure on us. We may not be able to offset the effects of this potential pricing pressure. Our failure to adapt to changing market conditions and to compete successfully with established or new competitors may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. In particular, a failure to offset competitive pressures brought about by competitors or in-house solutions developed by our customers could result in a substantial reduction in or the outright termination of our contracts with some of our customers, which would have a significant, negative and material impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
The markets in which we market and sell our products and services are highly competitive, and if we do not adapt to rapid technological change, we could lose customers or market share, which could adversely affect our ability to sustain or grow revenue.
The industries we serve are characterized by rapid technological change and frequent new service offerings and are highly competitive with respect to the need for innovation. Significant technological changes could make our technology and services
obsolete, less marketable or less competitive. We must adapt to these rapidly changing markets by continually improving the features, functionality, reliability and responsiveness of our products and services, and by developing new features, services and applications to meet changing customer needs and further address the markets we serve. Our ability to take advantage of opportunities in the markets we serve may require us to invest in development and incur other expenses well in advance of our ability to generate revenues from these offerings or services. We may not be able to timely adapt to these challenges or respond successfully or in a cost-effective way. Our failure to do so would adversely affect our ability to compete and retain customers and/or market share and could adversely affect our ability to sustain or grow revenue. In addition, as we expand our service offerings, we may face competition from new and existing competitors. It is also possible that our customers could decide to create, invest in or collaborate in the creation of competitive products that might limit or reduce their need for our products, services and solutions. Further, we may experience delays in the development of one or more features of our offerings, which could materially reduce the potential benefits to us providing these services. In addition, our present or future service offerings may not satisfy the evolving needs of the industry in which we operate. If we are unable to anticipate or respond adequately to these evolving market needs, due to resource, technological or other constraints, our business and results of operations could be harmed. In addition, the arrival of new market entrants could reduce the demand for our services or cause us to reduce our pricing, resulting in a loss of revenue and adversely affecting our business, results of operations and financial condition. Also, the use of internal technologies, developed by our customers or their advisers, could reduce the demand for our services, result in pricing pressures or cause a reduction in our revenue. If we fail to manage these challenges adequately, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.
The success of our business depends on our ability to achieve or sustain market acceptance of our services and solutions at desired pricing levels.
Our competitors and customers may cause us to reduce the prices we charge for our services and solutions. Our current or future competitors may offer our customers services at reduced prices or bundling and pricing services in a manner that may make it difficult for us to compete. Customers with a significant volume of transactions may attempt to use this leverage in pricing negotiations with us. Also, if our prices are too high, current or potential customers may find it economically advantageous to handle certain functions internally instead of using our services. We may not be able to offset the effects of any price reductions by increasing the number of transactions we handle or the number of customers we serve, by generating higher revenue from enhanced services or by reducing our costs. If these or other sources of pricing pressure cause us to reduce the pricing of our service or solutions below desirable levels, our business and results of operations may be adversely affected.
If we fail to keep pace with technological advances in the industry, or if we pursue technologies that do not become commercially accepted, customers may not buy our products or use our services.
The telecommunications industry uses numerous and varied technologies, and large service providers often invest in several, and sometimes incompatible, technologies. The industry also demands frequent and, at times, significant technology upgrades. Furthermore, enhancing our services revenues requires that we develop and maintain leading tools. We will not have the resources to invest in all existing and potential technologies. As a result, we expect to concentrate our resources on those technologies that we believe have or will achieve substantial customer acceptance and in which we will have appropriate technical expertise. However, existing products often have short product life cycles characterized by declining prices over their lives. In addition, our choices for developing technologies may prove incorrect if customers do not adopt the products that we develop or if those technologies ultimately prove to be unviable. Our revenues and operating results will depend, to a significant extent, on our ability to maintain a product portfolio and service capability that is attractive to our current and future customers; to enhance our existing products; to continue to introduce new products successfully and on a timely basis; and to develop new or enhance existing tools for our services offerings. The development of new technologies remains a significant risk to us, due to the efforts that we still need to make to achieve technological feasibility, due to rapidly changing customer markets; and due to significant competitive threats. Our failure to bring these products to market in a timely manner could result in a loss of market share or a lost opportunity to capitalize on new markets for emerging technologies and could have a material adverse impact on our business, operating results and financial condition.
Though acceptance of cloud-based software has advanced in recent years, some businesses may still be hesitant to adopt these types of solutions.
Our cloud-based service strategy may not be successful. We enable our customers to offer their subscribers the ability to backup, restore and share content across multiple devices through a cloud-based environment. Some businesses may still be uncertain as to whether a cloud-based service like ours is appropriate for their business needs. The success of our offerings is dependent upon continued acceptance by and growth in subscribers of cloud-based services in general and there can be no guarantee of the adoption rate by these subscribers. Many organizations have invested substantial personnel and financial resources to integrate traditional enterprise software into their organizations and, therefore, may be reluctant or unwilling to
migrate to a cloud-based model for storing, accessing, sharing and managing their content. Because we derive, and expect to continue to derive, a substantial portion of our revenue and cash flows from sales of our cloud-based solutions, our success will depend to a substantial extent on the widespread adoption of cloud computing for companies in general. Our cloud strategy will continue to evolve, and we may not be able to compete effectively, generate significant revenues or maintain profitability. While we believe our expertise, investments in infrastructure, and the breadth of our cloud-based services provides us with a strong foundation to compete, it is uncertain whether our strategies will attract the users or generate the revenue required to be successful. In addition to software development costs, we incur costs to build and maintain infrastructure to support cloud-based services. It is difficult to predict customer adoption rates and demand for our services, the future growth rate and size of the cloud computing market or the entry of competitive services. The expansion of a cloud-based enterprise software market depends on a number of factors, including the cost, performance and perceived value associated with cloud computing, as well as the ability of companies that provide cloud-based services to address security and privacy concerns. If we or other providers of cloud-based services experience security incidents, loss of customer data, disruptions in delivery or other problems, the market for cloud-based services as a whole, including our services, may be negatively affected. If there is a reduction in demand for cloud-based services caused by a lack of customer acceptance, technological challenges, weakening economic conditions, security or privacy concerns, competing technologies and products, decreases in corporate spending or otherwise, we could experience decreased revenue, which could harm our growth rates and adversely affect our business and operating results.
We rely in part on strategic relationships with third parties to sell and deliver our solutions. If we are unable to successfully develop and maintain these relationships, our business may be harmed.
In addition to generating customer referrals through third-party users of our solutions, we intend to pursue relationships with other third parties such as technology and content providers and implementation and distribution partners. Our future growth will depend, at least in part, on our ability to enter into and maintain successful strategic relationships with these third parties. Identifying partners and negotiating and documenting relationships with them requires significant time and resources, as does integrating third-party content and technology. Some of the third parties with whom we have strategic relationships have entered and may continue to enter into strategic relationships with our competitors. Further, these third parties may have multiple strategic relationships and may not regard us as significant for their businesses. As a result, they may choose to offer their services on terms that are unfavorable to us, terminate their respective relationships with us, pursue other partnerships or relationships, or attempt to develop or acquire services or solutions that compete with ours. Our relationships with strategic partners could also interfere with our ability to enter into desirable strategic relationships with other potential partners in the future. If we are unsuccessful in establishing or maintaining relationships with strategic partners on favorable economic terms, our ability to compete in the marketplace or to grow our revenue could be impaired, and our business, results of operations and financial condition would suffer. Even if we are successful, we cannot provide assurance that these relationships will result in increased revenue or customer usage of our solutions or that the economic terms of these relationships will not adversely affect our margins.
If we do not maintain the compatibility of our services with third-party applications that our customers use in their business processes or if we fail to adapt our services to changes in technology or the marketplace, demand for our services could decline.
Our solutions can be used alongside a wide range of other systems such as email and enterprise software systems used by our customers in their businesses. If we do not support the continued integration of our products and services with third-party applications, including through the provision of application programming interfaces that enable data to be transferred readily between our services and third-party applications, demand for our services could decline and we could lose sales or experience declining renewal rates. We will also be required to make our products and services compatible with new or additional third-party applications that are introduced to the markets that we serve and, if we are not successful, we could experience reduced demand for our services. In addition, prospective customers, especially large enterprise customers, may require heavily customized features and functions unique to their business processes. If prospective customers require customized features or functions that we do not offer and that would be difficult for them to develop and integrate within our services, then the market for our products and services may be adversely affected.
We may not currently or in the future appropriately leverage advances in technology to achieve or sustain a competitive advantage in products, services, information and processes. Our customers and users regularly adopt new technologies and industry standards continue to evolve. The introduction of products or services and the emergence of new industry standards can render our existing services obsolete and unmarketable in short periods of time. We expect others to continue to develop and introduce new and enhance existing products and services that will compete with our services. Our future success will depend, in part, on our ability to enhance our current services and to develop and introduce new services that keep pace with technological developments, emerging industry standards and the needs of our customers. We cannot assure that we will be successful in cost-effectively developing, marketing and selling new services or service enhancements that meet these changing
demands on a timely basis, that we will not experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development, introduction and marketing of these services, or that our new service and service enhancements will adequately meet the demands of the marketplace and achieve market acceptance. We also cannot assure that the features that we believe will drive purchasing decisions will in fact be the features that our current or potential customers consider most significant.
Legal, Regulatory and Compliance Risks
Government regulation of the Internet and e-commerce and of the international exchange of certain information is subject to possible unfavorable changes, and our failure to comply with applicable regulations could harm our business and operating results.
As Internet commerce continues to evolve, increasing regulation by federal, state, local and foreign governments become more likely. For example, in recent years, numerous federal, state, local and foreign laws regarding privacy and the collection, processing, storage, sharing, disclosure, use or protection of personal information and other data have been enacted. The scope of these laws is expanding, they are subject to differing interpretations and may be costly to comply with and may be inconsistent between countries and jurisdictions or conflict with other rules. Further, laws and regulations applying to the solicitation, collection, processing or use of personal or consumer information could affect our customers’ ability to use and share data, potentially reducing demand for our products and services. In addition, taxation of products and services provided over the Internet or other charges imposed by government agencies or by private organizations for accessing the Internet may also be imposed. Any regulation imposing greater fees for Internet use or restricting the exchange of information over the Internet could result in reduced growth or a decline in the use of the Internet and could diminish the viability of our Internet-based services, which could harm our business and operating results.
Changes in laws, regulations or governmental policy applicable to our customers or potential customers may decrease the demand for our solutions or increase our costs.
The level of our customers’ and potential customers’ activity in the business processes our services are used to support is sensitive to many factors beyond our control, including governmental regulation and regulatory policies. Many of our customers and potential customers in the telecommunications and other industries are subject to substantial regulation and may be the subject of further regulation in the future. Accordingly, significant new laws or regulations or changes in, or repeals of, existing laws, regulations or governmental policy may change the way these customers do business and could cause the demand for and sales of our solutions to decrease. Any change in the scope of applicable regulations that either decreases the volume of transactions that our customers or potential customers enter into or otherwise negatively impacts their use of our solutions would have a material adverse effect on our revenues or gross margins, or both. Moreover, complying with increased or changed regulations could cause our operating expenses to increase as we may have to reconfigure our existing services or develop new services to adapt to new regulatory rules and policies, either of which would require additional expense and time. Additionally, the information provided by, or residing in, the software or services we provide to our customers could be deemed relevant to a regulatory investigation or other governmental or private legal proceeding involving our customers, which could result in requests for information from us that could be expensive and time consuming for us to address or harm our reputation since our customers rely on us to protect the confidentiality of their information. These types of changes could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
Our expansion into additional international markets may be subject to uncertainties that could increase our costs to comply with regulatory requirements in foreign jurisdictions, disrupt our operations and require increased focus from our management.
Our growth strategy includes the growth of our operations in foreign jurisdictions. International operations are subject to numerous additional risks, including economic and political risks in foreign jurisdictions in which we operate or seek to operate, potential additional costs due to localization and other geographic specific costs, difficulty in enforcing contracts and collecting receivables through some foreign legal and financial systems, unexpected changes in legal and regulatory requirements, differing technology standards and pace of adoption, fluctuations in currency exchange rates, varying regional and geopolitical business conditions and demands. The difficulties associated with managing a large organization spread throughout various countries and potential tax issues, including restrictions on repatriating earnings and multiple changing and complex tax laws and regulations, and the differences in foreign laws and regulations, including foreign tax, data privacy requirements, anti-competition, intellectual property, labor, trade and other laws. Additionally, compliance with international and U.S. laws and regulations that apply to our international operations may increase our cost of doing business in foreign jurisdictions. Violation of these laws and regulations could result in fines, criminal sanctions against us, our officers or our employees, or prohibitions on the conduct of our business. As we continue to expand our business globally, our success will depend, in large part, on our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these and other risks associated with our international
operations. However, any of these factors could adversely affect our international operations and, consequently, our operating results.
If we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights, our competitive position could be harmed, or we could be required to incur significant expenses to enforce our rights.
Our success depends to a significant degree upon the protection of our software and other proprietary technology rights. We rely on trade secret, copyright and trademark laws and confidentiality agreements with employees and third parties, all of which offer only limited protection. We also regularly file patent applications to protect inventions arising from our research and development and have obtained a number of patents in the United States and other countries. There can be no assurance that our patent applications will be approved, that any issued patents will adequately protect our intellectual property, or that our patents will not be challenged by third parties. Also, much of our business and many of our solutions rely on key technologies developed or licensed by third or other parties and we may not be able to obtain or continue to obtain licenses and technologies from these third parties at all or on reasonable terms. The steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property may not prevent misappropriation of our proprietary rights or the reverse engineering of our solutions. Legal standards relating to the validity, enforceability and scope of protection of intellectual property rights in other countries are uncertain and may afford little or no effective protection of our proprietary technology. Consequently, we may be unable to prevent our proprietary technology from being exploited abroad, which could require costly efforts to protect our technology. Policing the unauthorized use of our products, trademarks and other proprietary rights is expensive, difficult and, in some cases, impossible. Litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce or defend our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. This type of litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of management resources, either of which could materially harm our business. Accordingly, despite our efforts, we may not be able to prevent third parties from infringing upon or misappropriating our intellectual property.
We collect, process, store, disclose and use personal information and other data, and our actual or perceived failure to protect this information and data could damage our reputation and harm our business and operating results.
We collect, process, store, disclose and use personal information and other data provided by our customers and their end users. We rely on encryption and authentication technology licensed from third parties to effectively secure transmission of this information. There are numerous federal, state, local and foreign laws regarding privacy and the collection, processing, storage, sharing, disclosure, use or protection of personal information and other data. The scope of these laws is changing, they are subject to differing interpretations and they may be costly to comply with and may be inconsistent between countries and jurisdictions or conflict with other rules.
Our handling of data is subject to a variety of laws and regulations, including regulation by various government agencies, such as the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”), and various state, local, and foreign agencies. Our data handling is also subject to contractual obligations and industry standards. The U.S. federal and various state and foreign governments have adopted or proposed limitations on the collection, distribution, use, and storage of data relating to individuals and businesses, including the use of contact information and other data for marketing, advertising, and other communications with individuals and businesses. In the United States, various laws and regulations apply to the collection, processing, disclosure, and security of certain types of data, including the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, the Gramm Leach Bliley Act, the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, and the now in question EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield protections, as well as state laws relating to privacy and data security. Additionally, the FTC and many state attorneys general are interpreting federal and state consumer protection laws as imposing standards for the online collection, use, dissemination, and security of data. For example, California enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (CCPA), which took effect on January 1, 2020 and became enforceable by the California Attorney General on July 1, 2020, and broadly defines personal information. The CCPA creates new individual privacy rights for consumers (as that term is broadly defined) and places increased privacy and security obligations on entities handling personal data of consumers or households. The CCPA requires covered companies to provide certain disclosures to California consumers about its data collection, use and sharing practices, provide such consumers with ways to opt-out of certain sales or transfers of personal information, provides for civil penalties for violations, and allows for a new private right of action for data breaches that has resulted in an increase in data breach litigation. It remains unclear, however, how the CCPA will be interpreted. As currently written, it will likely impact our business activities and exemplifies the vulnerability of our business to not only cyber threats but also the evolving regulatory environment related to personal data and protected health information. Many aspects of the California Consumer Privacy Act and its interpretation remain unclear, and its full impact on our business and operations remains uncertain.
Additionally, a new California ballot initiative, the California Privacy Rights Act, or “CPRA,” was passed in November 2020. Effective starting on January 1, 2023, the CPRA imposes additional obligations on companies covered by the legislation
and will significantly modify the CCPA, including by expanding consumers’ rights with respect to certain sensitive personal information. The CPRA also creates a new state agency that will be vested with authority to implement and enforce the CCPA and the CPRA. The effects of the CCPA and the CPRA are potentially significant and may require us to modify our data collection or processing practices and policies and to incur substantial costs and expenses in an effort to comply and increase our potential exposure to regulatory enforcement and/or litigation.
The laws and regulations relating to privacy and data security are evolving, can be subject to significant change, and may result in ever-increasing regulatory and public scrutiny and escalating levels of enforcement and sanctions. The CCPA, in particular, could mark the beginning of a trend toward more stringent state privacy legislation in the United States, which could in certain circumstances increase our potential liability and adversely affect our business. Certain other state laws impose similar privacy obligations, others, such as Virginia and Washington, have proposed broad privacy laws that are similar to the CCPA and we anticipate that more states may enact legislation similar to the CCPA, which provides consumers with new privacy rights and increases the privacy and security obligations of entities handling certain personal information of such consumers. The CCPA has prompted a number of proposals for new federal and state-level privacy legislation. Such proposed legislation, if enacted, may add additional complexity, variation in requirements, restrictions and potential legal risk, require additional investment of resources in compliance programs, impact strategies and the availability of previously useful data and could result in increased compliance costs and/or changes in business practices and policies.
Many of the foreign jurisdictions where we or our customers operate or conduct business, including the European Union, have laws and regulations dealing with the collection, use, storage, and disclosure and other handling (collectively, “processing”) of personal information, which in some cases are more restrictive than those in the United States. In addition to regulating the processing of personal information within the relevant jurisdictions, these legal requirements often also apply to the processing of personal information outside these jurisdictions, where there is some specified link to the relevant jurisdiction. For example, Synchronoss has multiple offices in Europe and serves clients and their customers throughout the European Union (“EU”), where the GDPR went into effect in 2018. The GDPR, which also is the law in Iceland, Norway, Liechtenstein, and - to a large degree - the United Kingdom, has an extensive global reach and imposes robust obligations relating to the processing of personal information, including documentation requirements, greater control for data subjects (e.g., the “right to be forgotten” and data portability), security requirements, notice requirements, restrictions on sharing personal information, data governance obligations, data breach notification requirements, and restrictions on the export of personal information to most other countries (discussed in further detail below).The solutions that we currently offer subject us to many of these laws and regulations in many of the foreign jurisdictions where we operate or conduct business, and these laws and regulations may be modified or subject to new or different interpretations, and new laws and regulations may be enacted in the future.
Recent legal developments have created compliance uncertainty regarding some transfers of personal information from the UK and European Economic Area to locations where we or our customers operate or conduct business, including the United States and potentially Singapore, particularly with respect to cross-border transfers. Under the GDPR, such transfers can take place only if certain conditions apply or if certain data transfer mechanisms are in place. In July 2020, the Court of Justice of the European Union ruled in its “Schrems II” decision (C-311/18), that the Privacy Shield was invalid and could no longer be used due to the strength of United States surveillance laws. In September 2020, the Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner of Switzerland (where the law has a similar restriction on the export of personal information) issued an opinion concluding that the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework does not provide an adequate level of protection for data transfers from Switzerland to the United States pursuant to Switzerland’s Federal Act on Data Protection. Synchronoss and our customers continue to use alternative transfer strategies, including the European Commission’s Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs), while the authorities interpret the Schrems II decision and the validity of alternative data transfer mechanisms. The SCCs, though previously approved by the European Commission, have faced challenges in European courts (including being called into question in the Schrems II decision), and may be further challenged, suspended or invalidated for transfers to some or all countries. For example, guidance regarding Schrems II issued by the European Data Protection Board (which is comprised of representatives from every EU member state’s top data protection authority) have cast serious doubt on the validity of SCCs for most transfers of personal information to the United States. At present, there are few viable alternatives to the Privacy Shield and the SCCs, so such developments may necessitate further expenditures on local infrastructure, changes to internal business processes, changes to products, or may otherwise affect or restrict our sales and operations.
E.U. data protection authorities have the power to impose administrative fines for violations of the GDPR of up to a maximum of €20 million or 4% of a corporate family’s total worldwide global turnover for the preceding fiscal year, whichever is higher. Such penalties are in addition to any civil litigation claims by clients, data subjects or other third parties. We believe that the solutions that we currently offer subject us to the GDPR and other laws and regulations relating to privacy, data protection, and information security, and these may be modified or subject to new or different interpretations in the future. We will need to take steps to address compliance obligations in this rapidly evolving legal environment, but we cannot assure you
that we will be able to implement changes in a timely manner or without significant disruption to our business, or that such steps will be effective, and we may face the risk of liability and loss of business.
In addition, further to the United Kingdom's (UK) exit from the EU on January 31, 2020, the GDPR ceased to apply in the UK at the end of the transition period on December 31, 2020. However, as of January 1, 2021, the UK’s European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 incorporated the GDPR (as it existed on December 31, 2020 but subject to certain UK specific amendments) into UK law (referred to as the 'UK GDPR'). The UK GDPR and the UK Data Protection Act 2018 set out the UK’s data protection regime, which is independent from but aligned to the EU’s data protection regime. Non-compliance with the UK GDPR may result in monetary penalties of up to £17.5 million or 4% of worldwide revenue, whichever is higher. The UK, however, is now regarded as a third country under the EU’s GDPR which means that transfers of personal data from the EEA to the UK will be restricted unless an appropriate safeguard, as recognized by the EU’s GDPR, has been put in place. Although, under the EU-UK Trade Cooperation Agreement it is lawful to transfer personal data between the UK and the EEA for a 6 month period following the end of the transition period, with a view to achieving an adequacy decision from the European Commission during that period. Like the EU GDPR, the UK GDPR restricts personal data transfers outside the UK to countries not regarded by the UK as providing adequate protection (this means that personal data transfers from the UK to the EEA remain free flowing).
This lack of clarity on future UK laws and regulations and their interaction with EU laws and regulations could add legal risk, uncertainty, complexity and cost to our handling of EU personal information and our privacy and data security compliance programs. It is possible that over time the UK Data Protection Act could become less aligned with the EU General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, which could require us to implement different compliance measures for the UK and the European Union and result in potentially enhanced compliance obligations for EU personal data.
As noted above, the scope and interpretation of the laws that are or may be applicable to us are often uncertain and may be conflicting, as a result of the rapidly evolving regulatory framework for privacy issues worldwide. As a result of the laws that are or may be applicable to us, and due to the sensitive nature of the information we collect, we have implemented policies and procedures to preserve and protect our data and our clients’ and client customers’ data against loss, misuse, corruption, misappropriation caused by systems failures, or unauthorized access. If our policies, procedures, or measures relating to privacy, data protection, marketing, or client communications fail to comply with laws, regulations, policies, legal obligations, or industry standards, we may be subject to governmental enforcement actions, litigation, regulatory investigations, fines, penalties, and negative publicity, and could cause our application providers, clients and partners to lose trust in us, and have an adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition.
In addition to government regulation, privacy advocates and industry groups may propose new and different self-regulatory standards that, if adopted, may apply to us, or which customers may require us to adopt. Because the interpretation and application of privacy and data protection laws, regulations, rules, and other standards are still uncertain, it is possible that these laws, rules, regulations, and other actual or alleged legal obligations, such as contractual or self-regulatory obligations, may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our existing data management practices or the functionality of our products. If so, in addition to the possibility of fines, lawsuits and other claims, we could be required to fundamentally change our business activities and practices or modify our software, which could have an adverse effect on our business. Any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with laws, regulations, policies, legal, or contractual obligations, industry standards, or regulatory guidance relating to privacy or data security, may result in governmental investigations and enforcement actions, litigation, fines and penalties, or adverse publicity, and could cause our clients and partners to lose trust in us, which could have an adverse effect on our reputation and business. We expect that there will continue to be new proposed laws, regulations, and industry standards relating to privacy, data protection, marketing, consumer communications, and information security, and we cannot determine the impact such future laws, regulations, and standards may have on our business. Future laws, regulations, standards, and other obligations or any changed interpretation of existing laws or regulations could impair our ability to develop and market new functionality and maintain and grow our client base and increase revenue. Future restrictions on the collection, use, sharing, or disclosure of data, or additional requirements for express or implied consent of our clients, partners, or end users for the use and disclosure of such information could require us to incur additional costs or modify our products, possibly in a material manner, and could limit our ability to develop new functionality.
If we are not able to comply with these laws or regulations, or if we become liable under these laws or regulations, we could be directly harmed, and we may be forced to implement new measures to reduce our exposure to this liability. This may require us to expend substantial resources or to discontinue certain solutions, which would negatively affect our business, financial condition, and operating results. In addition, the increased attention focused upon liability issues as a result of lawsuits and legislative proposals could harm our reputation or otherwise adversely affect the growth of our business. Furthermore, any costs incurred as a result of this potential liability could harm our operating results.
Compromises to our privacy safeguards or disclosure of confidential information could impact our reputation.
Names, addresses, telephone numbers, credit card data and other personal identification information (“PII”) are collected, processed and stored in our systems. Our treatment of this kind of information is subject to contractual restrictions and federal, state and foreign data privacy laws and regulations. We have implemented technical and organizational steps designed to protect against unauthorized access to PII and comply with these laws and regulations. Because of the inherent risks and complexities involved in protecting this information, the steps we have taken to protect PII may not be sufficient to prevent the misappropriation or improper disclosure of such PII. If misappropriation or disclosure of PII were to occur, our business could be harmed through reputational injury, litigation and possible damages claimed by the affected subscribers, including in some cases costs related to notification and fraud monitoring or potential fines from regulatory authorities. We may need to incur significant costs or modify our business practices and/or our services in order to comply with these data privacy and protection laws and regulations in the future. Even the mere perception of a security breach or inadvertent disclosure of PII could adversely affect our business and results of operations. In addition, third-party vendors that we engage to perform services for us may unintentionally release PII or otherwise fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations. Our insurance may not cover potential claims of this type or may not be adequate to cover all costs incurred in defense of potential claims or to indemnify us for all liability that may be imposed. Concerns about the security of online transactions and the privacy of PII could deter our customers from utilizing our products. The occurrence of any of these events could have an adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.
Fraudulent Internet transactions could negatively impact our business.
Our business may be exposed to risks associated with Internet credit card fraud and identity theft that could cause us to incur unexpected expenditures and loss of revenues. Under current credit card practices, a merchant is liable for fraudulent credit card transactions when, as is the case with the transactions we process, that merchant does not obtain a cardholder’s signature. Although our customers currently bear the risk for a fraudulent credit card transaction, in the future we may be forced to share some of that risk and the associated costs with our customers. To the extent that technology upgrades or other expenditures are required to prevent credit card fraud and identity theft, we may be required to bear the costs associated with such expenditures. In addition, to the extent that credit card fraud and/or identity theft cause a decline in business transactions over the Internet generally, both the business of our customers and our business could be adversely affected.
Claims by others that we infringe their proprietary technology could harm our business.
Third parties could claim that our current or future products or technology infringe their proprietary rights. We expect that software developers will increasingly be subject to infringement claims as the number of products and competitors providing software and services to the communications industry increases and overlaps occur. Any claim of infringement by a third party, even those without merit, could cause us to incur substantial costs defending against the claim, and could distract our management from our business. Furthermore, a party making a claim of this nature, if successful, could secure a judgment that requires us to pay substantial damages. A judgment could also include an injunction or other court order that could prevent us from offering our products or services. Any of these events could seriously harm our business.
We are generally obligated to indemnify our customers if our services infringe the proprietary rights of third parties and certain of our agreements with customers and partners include indemnification provisions under which we have agreed to indemnify the counter-party for losses suffered or incurred as a result of claims of intellectual property infringement and, in some cases, for financial and other damages caused by us to property or persons. Third parties may assert infringement claims against our customers or partners. These claims may require us to initiate or defend protracted and costly litigation on behalf of our customers or partners, regardless of the merits of these claims. If any of these claims succeed, we may be forced to pay damages on behalf of our customers or partners.
If anyone asserts a claim against us relating to proprietary technology or information, while we might seek to license their intellectual property, we might not be able to obtain a license on commercially reasonable terms or on any terms. In addition, any efforts to develop non-infringing technology could be unsuccessful. Our failure to obtain the necessary licenses or other rights or to develop non-infringing technology could prevent us from offering our services and could therefore seriously harm our business.
Our use of “open source” software could negatively affect our ability to sell our services and subject us to possible litigation.
A portion of the technologies licensed by us incorporates “open source” software, and we may incorporate open source software in the future. Open source software is generally licensed by its authors or other third parties under open source licenses. If we fail to comply with these licenses, we may be subject to certain conditions, including requirements that we offer
any of our services that incorporate the open source software at no cost. Additionally, we may be required to make publicly available any source code for modifications or derivative works we create based upon, incorporating or using the open source software and/or license those modifications or alterations on terms that are unfavorable to us. If an author or other third party that distributes open source software were to allege that we had not complied with the conditions of one or more of these licenses, we could be required to incur significant legal expenses defending against such allegations and could be subject to significant damages, enjoined from selling those of our services that contained the open source software and required to comply with the foregoing conditions, which could disrupt the distribution and sale of some of our services. In addition to risks related to license requirements, usage of open source software can lead to greater risks than use of third-party commercial software, as open source licensors generally do not provide technology support, maintenance, warranties or assurance of title or controls on the origin of the software.
We continue to incur significant costs as a result of operating as a public company, and our management is required to devote substantial time to new and ongoing compliance initiatives.
We operate as a public company, and will continue to incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses as we comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the “Sarbanes-Oxley Act” or “SOX”), the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and other public company disclosure and corporate governance requirements, as well as any new rules that may subsequently be implemented by the Securities and Exchange Commission and/or Nasdaq, the exchange on which our common stock is listed (Nasdaq: SNCR). These rules impose various requirements on public companies, including requirements related to disclosures, corporate governance and internal controls. We expect that the requirements of these rules and regulations will continue to increase our legal, accounting and financial compliance costs, make some activities more difficult, time consuming and costly and place significant strain on our personnel, systems and resources. Our management and other personnel will continue to devote a substantial amount of time to these compliance initiatives. Moreover, these rules and regulations increase our legal and financial compliance costs and make some activities more time-consuming and costlier. For example, we expect these rules and regulations may make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance, and we may be required to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantial costs to maintain the same or similar coverage. These rules and regulations could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors, our board committees or as executive officers.
Changes in, or interpretations of, tax rules and regulations, could adversely affect our effective tax rates.
On December 22, 2017, former President Trump signed into law the tax legislation commonly known as the ""Tax Cuts and Jobs Act"" (the “TCJA”) that significantly changes the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. Subsequent to TCJA, the U.S. Department of Treasury and Internal Revenue Service issued several complex proposed and final regulations, and related guidance, regarding provisions of the Tax Act. However, several aspects of the legislation remain unclear and subject to interpretation. While our current tax accounting is completely based on legislative updates relating to the U.S. TCJA, further interpretive guidance of the U.S. TCJA's provisions could result in further adjustments that could have an impact on our future results of operations, cash flows or financial positions. Furthermore, states continue to issue guidance and enact legislation in response to the Tax Act, all of which could have an impact on our income tax expense, assets and liabilities. Unanticipated changes in our tax rates could affect our future results of operations. Our future effective tax rates could be unfavorably affected by changes in tax laws or the interpretation of tax laws or by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities. It is possible that future requirements, including the recently proposed implementation of International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) could change our current application of U.S. GAAP, resulting in a material adverse impact on our financial position or results of operations. In addition, we are subject to the continued examination of our income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”), and other tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of outcomes resulting from these examinations, if any, to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. We believe our estimates to be reasonable, but there can be no assurance that the final determination of any of these examinations will not have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial position.
If we are required to collect sales and use taxes on the services we sell in additional jurisdictions, we may be subject to liability for past sales and our future sales could decrease.
We currently collect sales or use tax on our services in most states. Historically, with a few exceptions, we have not charged or collected value added tax on our services anywhere in the world. We may lose sales or incur significant expenses should tax authorities in other jurisdictions where we do business be successful in imposing sales and use taxes, value added taxes or similar taxes on the services we provide. A successful assertion by one or more tax authorities that we should collect sales or other taxes on the sale of our services could result in substantial tax liabilities for past sales, including interest and penalty charges, and could discourage customers from purchasing our services and otherwise harm our business. Further, we may conclude based on our own review that our services may be subject to sales and use taxes in other areas where we do
business. Under these circumstances, we may voluntarily disclose our estimated liability to the respective tax authorities and initiate activities to collect taxes going forward. It is not clear that our services are subject to sales and use tax in certain jurisdictions. States and certain municipalities in the United States, as well as countries outside the United States, have different rules and regulations governing sales and use taxes. These rules and regulations are subject to varying interpretations that may change over time and, in the future, our services may be subject to such taxes. Although our customer contracts typically provide that our customers are responsible for the payment of all taxes associated with the provision and use of our services, customers may decline to pay back taxes and may refuse responsibility for interest or penalties associated with those taxes. In certain cases, we may elect not to request customers to pay back taxes. If we are required to collect and pay back taxes and associated interest and penalties, and if our customers fail or refuse to reimburse us for all or a portion of these amounts, or if we elect not to seek payment of these amounts, we will incur unplanned expenses that may be substantial. Moreover, imposition of such taxes on our services going forward will effectively increase the cost of our services to our customers and may adversely affect our ability to retain existing customers or gain new customers in jurisdictions in which such taxes are imposed. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation or financial condition.
Risks Related to Series A Preferred Stock and our Common Stock
Our Series A Preferred Stock contains covenants that may limit our business flexibility.
On February 15, 2018, in accordance with the terms of that certain Securities Purchase Agreement dated as of October 17, 2017 with Silver Private Holdings I, LLC (“Silver”), an affiliate of Siris Capital Group, LLC (“Siris”), we issued to Silver 185,000 shares of our newly issued “Series A Preferred Stock”, par value $0.0001 per share, with an initial liquidation preference of $1,000 per share, in exchange for $97.7 million in cash and the transfer from Silver to us of 5,994,667 shares of our common stock held by Silver. In connection with the issuance of the Series A Preferred Stock, we filed a Certificate of Designations with the State of Delaware setting forth the rights, preferences, privileges, qualifications, restrictions and limitations on the Series A Preferred Stock (the “Series A Certificate”). The holders of a majority of the Series A Preferred Stock, voting separately as a class, are entitled at each of our annual meetings of stockholders or at any special meeting called for the purpose of electing directors (or by written consent signed by the holders of a majority of the then-outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock in lieu of such a meeting): (i) to nominate and elect two members of our Board of Directors for so long as the Preferred Percentage (as defined in the Series A Certificate) is equal to or greater than 10%; and (ii) to nominate and elect one member of our Board of Directors for so long as the Preferred Percentage is equal to or greater than 5% but less than 10%.
For so long as the holders of shares of our Series A Preferred Stock have the right to nominate at least one director, we are required to obtain the prior approval of Silver prior to taking certain actions, including:
•certain dividends, repayments and redemptions;
•any amendment to our certificate of incorporation that adversely effects the rights, preferences, privileges or voting powers of the Series A Preferred Stock;
•issuances of stock ranking senior or equivalent to shares of Series A Preferred Stock (including additional shares of Series A Preferred Stock) in the priority of payment of dividends or in the distribution of assets upon any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of us;
•changes in the size of our Board of Directors;
•any amendment, alteration, modification or repeal of the charter of our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of the Board of Directors and related documents; and
•any change in our principal business or the entry into any line of business outside of our existing lines of businesses.
In addition, in the event that we are in EBITDA Non-Compliance (as defined in the Series A Certificate) or the undertaking of certain actions would result in us exceeding a specified pro forma leverage ratio, then the prior approval of Silver would be required to incur indebtedness (or alter any debt document) in excess of $10.0 million, enter or consummate any transaction where the fair market value exceeds $5.0 million individually or $10.0 million in the aggregate in a fiscal year or authorize or commit to capital expenditures in excess of $25.0 million in a fiscal year. There is no guarantee that the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock would approve any such restricted action, even where such an action would be in the best interests of our stockholders. Any failure to obtain such approval could harm our business and result in a decrease in the value of our common stock.
Our Series A Preferred Stock has rights, preferences and privileges that are not held by, and are preferential to, the rights of our common stockholders, which could adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition, and may result in the interests of the holders of our Series A Preferred Stock differing from those of our common stockholders.
The holders of our Series A Preferred Stock have the right to receive a liquidation preference entitling them to be paid out of our assets available for distribution to stockholders before any payment may be made to holders of any other class or series of capital stock, an amount equal to the greater of the stated value of such holder’s shares of Series A Preferred Stock or the amount that such holder would have been entitled to receive upon our liquidation, dissolution and winding up if all outstanding shares of our Series A Preferred Stock had been converted into common stock immediately prior to such liquidation, dissolution or winding up, plus accrued but unpaid dividends. In addition, dividends on Series A Preferred Stock accrue and are cumulative at the rate of 14.5% per annum, payable quarterly in arrears in cash or in-kind. The holders of our Series A Preferred Stock also have certain redemption rights, including the right to require us to repurchase all or any portion of the Series A Preferred Stock upon the occurrence of certain events. These dividend and redemption obligations could impact our liquidity and reduce the amount of cash flows available for working capital, capital expenditures, growth opportunities, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes. Our obligations to the holders of Series A Preferred Stock, including the requirement that we obtain the consent of such holders prior to incurring additional indebtedness under certain circumstances, could also limit our ability to obtain additional financing or increase our borrowing costs, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition. The preferential rights could also result in divergent interests between the holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock and holders of our common stock. The two members of our Board of Directors elected by the Series A Preferred Stock, Frank Baker and Peter Berger, are affiliated with Silver, which holds all outstanding shares of our Series A Preferred Stock. Notwithstanding the fact that all directors are subject to fiduciary duties to us and to applicable law, the interests of the directors elected by the holders of the Series A Preferred may differ from the interests of our security holders as a whole or of our other directors.
Our stock price may continue to experience significant fluctuations and could subject us to litigation.
Our stock price, like that of other technology companies, continues to fluctuate greatly. Our stock price, and demand for our stock, can be affected by many factors, such as unanticipated changes in management, quarterly increases or decreases in our earnings, speculation in the investment community about our financial condition or results of operations and changes in revenue or earnings estimates, announcement of new services, technological developments, alliances, or acquisitions by us. Additionally, the price of our common stock may continue to fluctuate greatly in the future due to factors that are non-company specific, such as the decline in the United States and/or international economies, acts of terror against the United States or other jurisdictions where we conduct business, war or due to a variety of company specific factors, including quarter to quarter variations in our operating results, shortfalls in revenue, gross margin or earnings from levels projected by securities analysts and the other factors discussed in these risk factors. In addition, if the market for technology stocks or the stock market in general experiences uneven investor confidence, the market price of our common stock could decline for reasons unrelated to our business, operating results or financial condition. Fluctuation in market price and demand for our common stock may limit or prevent investors from readily selling their shares of common stock and may otherwise negatively affect the liquidity of our common stock. Causes of volatility in the market price of our stock could subject us to securities class action litigation. We are currently, and may in the future be, the subject of lawsuits that could require us to incur substantial costs defending against those lawsuits and divert the time and attention of our management.
The decline in the market price of our securities and the restatement of our previously issued financial results has resulted in private litigation that if results in judgments against us could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.
We are subject to stockholder derivative litigation relating to certain of our previous public disclosures and may result in additional litigation. For additional discussion of this litigation, see Item 3. “Legal Proceedings” contained in this Form 10-K. Our management has been and may be required in the future to devote significant time and attention to this litigation, and this and any additional matters that arise could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition as well as on our reputation. While we cannot estimate our potential exposure in these matters at this time, we have already incurred significant expense defending this litigation and expect to continue to need to incur significant expense in the defense. The existence of any litigation may have an adverse effect on our reputation with referral sources and our customers themselves, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. The outcome and amount of resources needed to respond to, defend or resolve lawsuits is unpredictable and may remain unknown for long periods of time. Our exposure under these matters may also include our indemnification obligations, to the extent we have any, to current and former officers and directors and, in some cases former underwriters, against losses incurred in connection with these matters, including reimbursement of legal fees and other expenses. Although we maintain insurance for claims of this nature, our insurance coverage does not apply in all circumstances and may be denied or insufficient to cover the costs related to the
class action and stockholder derivative lawsuits. In addition, these matters or future lawsuits involving us may increase our insurance premiums, deductibles or co-insurance requirements or otherwise make it more difficult for us to maintain or obtain adequate insurance coverage on acceptable terms, if at all. Moreover, adverse publicity associated with negative developments in pending legal proceedings could decrease customer demand for our services. As a result, the pending lawsuits and any future lawsuits involving us, or our officers or directors, could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and the trading price of our common stock.
Other than payment of dividends on our Series A Preferred Stock, we have never paid dividends on our capital stock and we do not anticipate paying any dividends in the foreseeable future. Consequently, any gains from an investment in our common stock will likely depend on whether the price of our common stock increases.
Other than the payment of dividends, either in-kind or in cash, on our Series A Preferred Stock in accordance with the Series A Certificate, we have not paid dividends on any of our classes of capital stock and we currently intend to retain our future earnings, if any, to fund the development and growth of our business, other than the payment of any dividends on our Series A Preferred Stock in accordance with the Series A Certificate. In addition, the terms of our current credit agreement and any future indebtedness that we may incur could preclude us from paying dividends. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of our common stock will be a shareholder’s sole source of gain for the foreseeable future. Consequently, in the foreseeable future, a shareholder will likely only experience a gain from an investment in our common stock if the price of our common stock increases.
Delaware law and provisions in our restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws could make a merger, tender offer or proxy contest difficult, therefore depressing the trading price of our common stock.
We are a Delaware corporation and the anti-takeover provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law may discourage, delay or prevent a change in control by prohibiting us from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years after the person becomes an interested stockholder, even if a change of control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders. In addition, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws and credit agreements may discourage, delay or prevent a change in our management or control over us that stockholders may consider favorable. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws:
•authorize the issuance of “blank check” preferred stock that could be issued by our board of directors to thwart a takeover attempt;
•prohibit cumulative voting in the election of directors, which would otherwise allow holders of less than a majority of the stock to elect some directors;
•establish a classified board of directors as a result of which successor to a director whose term has expired will be elected to serve from the time of election and qualification until the third annual meeting following election;
•require that directors only be removed from office for cause;
•provide that vacancies on the board of directors, including newly created directorships, may be filled only by a majority vote of directors then in office;
•limit who may call special meetings of stockholders;
•prohibit stockholder action by written consent, requiring all actions to be taken at a stockholder meeting; and
•establish advance notice requirements for nominating candidates for election to the board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings.
The affirmative vote of the holders of at least two-thirds of all of the then outstanding shares of our capital stock is generally necessary to amend or repeal the above provisions that are contained in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation. Also, absent approval of our board of directors, our amended and restated by-laws may only be amended or repealed by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of our shares of capital stock entitled to vote. In addition, we are subject to the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which limits business combination transactions with stockholders of 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock that our board of directors has not approved. These provisions and other similar provisions make it more difficult for stockholders or potential acquirers to acquire us. These provisions may apply even if some stockholders may consider the transaction beneficial to them. As a result, these provisions could limit the price that investors are willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock. These provisions might also discourage a potential acquisition proposal or tender offer, even if the acquisition proposal or tender offer is at a premium over the then current market price for our common stock.","ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS
None.","ITEM 2. PROPERTIES
We lease approximately 120,000 square feet of office space for our corporate headquarters in Bridgewater, New Jersey. We also lease approximately 38,000 square feet of office space in Phoenix, Arizona and 72,000 square foot facility in Bangalore, India. In addition to the above office space, we lease offices in certain countries including Australia, France, Ireland, Germany, England, Italy and Japan and in various states in the United States including Colorado and Virginia. Lease terms for our locations expire in the years between 2020 and 2028. We believe that the facilities we now lease are sufficient to meet our needs through at least the next twelve months. However, we may require additional office space after that time or if our current business plans change.","ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

Dividend Policy
Common Stock
We have never declared or paid cash dividends on our common equity. We do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Any future determination to declare cash dividends will be made at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, general business conditions and other factors that our Board of Directors may deem relevant. In addition, our ability to pay dividends is currently restricted by the terms of our Certificate of Designations of Series A Convertible Participating Perpetual Preferred Stock and our credit agreement with Citizens Bank, N.A. entered into in October 2019.
Preferred Stock
On February 15, 2018, the Company issued to Silver Private Holdings I, LLC (“Silver”), an affiliate of Siris Capital Group, LLC (“Siris”) 185,000 shares of our newly issued Series A Preferred Stock, par value $0.0001 per share. Under the Series A Certificate, the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock are entitled to receive, on each share of Series A Preferred Stock on a quarterly basis, an amount equal to the dividend rate of 14.5% divided by four and multiplied by the then-applicable Liquidation Preference (as defined in the Series A Certificate) per share of Series A Preferred Stock (collectively, the “Preferred Dividends”). The Preferred Dividends are due on January 1, April 1, July 1 and October 1 of each year (each, a “Series A Dividend Payment Date”). The Company may choose to pay the Preferred Dividends in cash or in additional shares of Series A Preferred Stock. In the event we do not declare and pay a dividend in-kind or in cash on any Series A Dividend Payment Date, the unpaid amount of the Preferred Dividend will be added to the Liquidation Preference.
The Company paid the following Preferred Dividends during the year ended December 31, 2020 and declared the following Preferred Dividends in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020:
•First Quarter - paid 7,873 shares of preferred dividends in the form of shares of Series A Preferred Stock.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (“MD&A”) is intended to provide a reader of our financial statements with a narrative from the perspective of our management on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and certain other factors that may affect our future results. The MD&A should be read in conjunction with the Financial Statements and Notes to the consolidated financial statements.
Impacts of the Recent Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19)
This disclosure discusses the actions the Company has taken in response to the COVID-19 crisis and the impacts that it has had on our business, as well as related known or expected trends.
COVID-19 was identified in China in late 2019 and has since spread throughout the world, including throughout the United States (U.S.). COVID-19 has resulted in authorities implementing numerous preventative measures to contain or mitigate the outbreak of the virus, such as travel bans and restrictions, limitations on business activity, quarantines, and shelter-in-place orders.
These restrictions and our responses to them are impacting our customers and their use of our products and services. In addition, governments have imposed a wide variety of consumer protection measures that limit how certain businesses, including TMT companies, can operate their businesses and interact with their customers. The crisis and governmental responses to the crisis have also resulted in a slowdown of global economic activity, which has impacted our customers. As a result, prior trends in our business may not be applicable to our operations during the pendency of the crisis.
The impact of COVID-19 will depend significantly on the duration and potential cyclicality of the health crisis and the related public policy actions, additional initiatives we undertake in response to employee, market or regulatory needs or demands, the length and severity of the global economic slowdown, and whether and how our customers change their behaviors over the longer term. As a result, the demand for our products and services, as well as our overall results of operations, may be materially and adversely impacted by the pandemic for the duration of 2021 or longer, and we are unable to predict the duration or degree of such impact with any certainty.
In response to COVID-19, we have been executing our business continuity plans and evolving our operations to protect the safety of our employees while continuing to provide critical products and services to our customers. Some of the initiatives the Company has undertaken include:
•Working with our customers to continue to provide our products and services through the pandemic
•Enhancing our safety protocols including moving the majority of our employees to remote work arrangements
•Adjusting business operations to address circumstances created by COVID-19
•Maintaining effective governance and internal controls in a remote work environment
As the crisis continues, we may revise our approach to these initiatives or take additional actions to meet the needs of our employees, customers and the Company and to continue to provide our products and services.
Revenues
We generate most of our revenues on a per transaction or subscription basis, which is derived from contracts that extend up to 60 months from execution.
The future success of our business depends on the continued growth of Business-to-Business and Business-to-Business-to-Consumer driving customer transactions, and continued expansion of our platforms into the TMT Market globally through Cloud, Messaging and Digital markets. As such, the volume of transactions and our ability to expand our footprint in TMT and globally may result in revenue fluctuations on a quarterly basis.
Most of our revenues are recorded in U.S. dollars but as we continue to expand our footprint with international carriers, we will become subject to currency translation that could affect our future net sales as reported in U.S. dollars.
The Company’s top five customers accounted for 68.0%, 69.2% and 69.0% of net revenues for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Contracts with these customers typically run for three to five years. Of these customers,
Verizon accounted for more than 10% of the Company’s revenues in 2020, 2019, and 2018. The loss of Verizon as a customer would have a material negative impact on our company. However, we believe that the costs incurred and subscriber disruption by Verizon to replace Synchronoss’ solutions would be substantial.
Current Trends Affecting Our Results of Operations
As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to develop, we are actively monitoring the global situation. The extent of the continuing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operational and financial performance will depend on certain developments, including the duration and spread of the outbreak, impact on our customers and our sales cycles, impact on our business operations, impact on our customer, employee or industry events, and effect on our vendors, all of which are uncertain and cannot be predicted. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic may continue to impact our business, financial condition or results of operations is uncertain, but may include, without limitation, impacts to our paying user growth as well as disruptions to our business operations as a result of travel restrictions, shutdown of workplaces and potential impacts to our vendors. Additionally, our results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates relative to U.S. dollars, our reporting currency, as well as changes in interest rates. Volatile market conditions arising from the COVID-19 pandemic have and may continue to negatively impact our results of operations and cash flows, due to a weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, which may cause our revenues to decline relative to our costs.
Business from our Synchronoss Personal Cloud™ solution has been driven by the growth in mobile devices globally that are becoming content rich. As these devices replace other traditional devices like PCs, the ability to securely back up content from mobile devices, sync it with other devices and share it with family, friends and business associates have become essential needs and subscriber expectations. Such devices include smartphones, connected cars, personal health and wellness devices and connected home devices. The need for the contents of these devices to be stored in a common cloud are also expected to be drivers of our business in the longer term.
Business from our traditional Synchronoss Messaging business (Email) has been driven by a resurgence in the need for white label secure messaging platforms that favor the Mobile Network Operator’s (“MNO”) business objectives and are not beholden to the objectives of a sponsoring over-the-top (“OTT”) platform. We believe that messaging drives higher subscriber engagement than any other application in the market today and holds the potential to stimulate new revenue from traditional services and third-party brands. OTT global success has driven MNOs to look at opportunities to preempt and compete with the OTTs which has potential opportunity for Synchronoss’ future growth to be driven by the need of TMT companies including (and especially) MNOs to embrace Messaging as a Platform (“MaaP”). MaaP will allow TMT and MNO’s to converse with subscribers in an efficient, automated way by streamlining the costs and increasing the effectiveness of self-care, as well as yielding cross-sell upselling of service plans, devices, bundles, etc. The Synchronoss Advanced Messaging Platform provides state of the art RCS-driven features including the ability to support advanced Peer to Peer communications and introduce new revenue streams driven by commerce and advertising via Application-to-Person capabilities.
Companies in the TMT market all face the dilemma of attempting to pivot their businesses to digital execution in order to create experiences that meet the expectations of their subscribers, generate new revenues and streamline costs creating healthier margins at a faster time to market than they have ever operated before. Their challenges feature the lack of skill sets to conceptualize and run day to day digital operations and the lack of resources to integrate their legacy back end systems to enact digital experiences that achieve their business objectives. The growth of Synchronoss Digital Platforms will be driven by the ability to provide TMT companies’ desire to obtain digital transformation solutions as quickly as possible while educating them on the ability to operate a digital business efficiently. Our Platform as a Service (“PaaS”) model provides a desirable alternative to heavy capital expenditure spending options often tried internally. The ability for our platforms to create low/no code, new customer digital journeys, virtually on the fly, gives TMT Companies the ability to operate new experiences and businesses without heavily investing in development resources.
To support our growth, which we expect to be driven by these favorable industry trends mentioned above, we will leverage modular components from our existing software platforms to build new products. We believe that these opportunities will continue to provide future benefits and position us for future revenue growth. We are also making investments in research and development of new products designed to enable us to grow rapidly in the mobile wireless market. Our purchase of capital assets and equipment may also increase based on aggressive deployment, subscriber growth and promotional offers for free or bundled storage by our major Tier 1 carrier customers.
We continue to expand our platforms into the converging TMT, MNO, and Digital spaces to enable connected devices to do more things across multiple networks, brands and communities. Our initiatives with AT&T, Verizon, Sprint, British Telecom, Softbank and other CSPs continue to grow both with regard to our current business as well as our new product
offerings. We are also exploring additional opportunities through merger and acquisition activities to support our customer, product and geographic diversification strategies.

________________________________
* Cost of revenues excludes depreciation and amortization which are shown separately.
Net revenues decreased $17.1 million to $291.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the same period in 2019. The overall change is due to:
•a $0.5 million decrease in Cloud revenues is primarily due to the extension of a significant commercial arrangement which extended recognition of deferred revenue across the term of the new contract, partially offset by increased subscriber growth and professional services revenue.
•a $2.3 million increase in Digital revenues is primarily driven an uptick in subscription services partially offset by a reduction in professional service business.
•an $18.8 million decrease in Messaging revenues was primarily driven by a significant 2019 non-recurring license and professional services revenue deal in advanced messaging. This revenue change was partially offset by favorable license renewals in 2020.
Net revenues decreased $17.1 million to $308.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to the same period in 2018. The overall change is due to:
•a $0.1 million increase in Cloud revenues due to a decrease in transaction revenue of $3.4 million offset by an increase in subscription revenue of $2.8 million and an increase in professional services revenue of $0.7 million.
•a $45.6 million decrease in Digital Transformation revenues is primarily driven by changes to the STIN business that led the Company to conclude that its collection of certain STIN receivables is no longer probable. In accordance with ASC 842, the portion of revenue that is no longer deemed collectible is reversed in the current period against revenue. Accordingly, the Company determined a contingency reserve is required, which was included as a reduction of revenue. The year over year change to STIN revenue was in excess of $34.6 million. The remaining change is primarily driven by a decline in business activity.
•an increase in Messaging revenues of $28.4 million primarily due to a growth in advanced messaging in North America as well as the continued delivery of an advanced messaging solution to a customer in the Japanese market.
Cost of revenues decreased $28.6 million to $121.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the same period in 2019. The 2020 decrease was primarily attributable to the year over year reduction in revenue and the cost savings from strategic initiatives implemented in the year driven mainly by data center consolidation and operating expense savings.
Cost of revenues decreased $8.4 million to $150.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to the same period in 2018. The 2019 decrease was primarily due to cost savings initiatives implemented in 2018 and continuing into 2019. These initiatives resulted in a decrease in cost of revenues driven mainly by data center consolidation and operating expense savings.
Research and development expense increased $1.5 million to $77.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the same period in 2019. The increase in 2020 is primarily related to the costs associated with the impairment of
the right of use assets. Excluding the impairment charges incurred in 2020, the research and development costs decreased year over year mainly as a result of executed cost savings initiatives to streamline our workforce and reduce vendor spend.
Research and development expense decreased $3.6 million to $75.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to the same period in 2018. The decrease in 2019 is primarily due to the realization of our strategic efforts to reduce costs and refocus our resources on key strategic priorities. These efforts resulted in decreased personnel related costs including stock-based compensation expense.
Selling, general and administrative expense decreased $23.5 million to $89.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the same period in 2019. The 2020 decrease was primarily attributable to significant cost cutting initiatives executed in year which included headcount reductions, reduced vendor spending and lower facility costs offset by impairments to our right of use assets.
Selling, general and administrative expense decreased $9.3 million to $112.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to the same period in 2018. The 2019 decrease was primarily due to a net reduction in professional services and outside consulting fees incurred and lower telecommunication and facility costs offset by a right of use asset impairment.
Restructuring charges were $8.0 million, $0.8 million and $12.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 respectively. The 2020 restructuring costs was primarily driven by our strategic cost savings initiatives to streamline our business operations and reduce headcount. 2019 restructuring costs were primarily related to employment termination costs as a result of the work-force reduction and facility consolidation plans. In prior years, we commenced separate plans designed to reduce operating costs and align our resources with our key strategic priorities, which resulted in work-force reductions and facility consolidations.
Depreciation and amortization expense decreased $33.4 million to $43.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the same period in 2019. The 2020 decrease was primarily attributable to the expiration of amortizable acquired assets and a reduction in capital expenditures. These changes were partially offset by the increased amortization of capitalized software.
Depreciation and amortization expense decreased $40.6 million to $77.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to the same period in 2018. The 2019 decrease was primarily attributable to the expiration of amortizable acquired assets, a reduction in capital expenditures, and the one-time Zentry, LLC (“Zentry”) impairment charge in 2018. These changes were partially offset by the increased amortization of capitalized software.
Income tax. The Company recognized approximately $27.1 million in related income tax benefit and $2.2 million in related income tax provision during the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The effective tax rate was approximately 72.4% for the year ended December 31, 2020, which was higher than the U.S. federal statutory rate primarily due to the benefit of the CARES Act provision allowing for a 5 year carryback of Net Operating Losses arising in 2018, 2019 and 2020. The Company’s effective tax rate was approximately (2.1)% for the year ended December 31, 2019, which was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate primarily due to pre-tax losses in jurisdictions where full valuation allowances have been recorded and in zero tax rate jurisdictions and permanent differences associated with U.S. Base Erosion and Anti Abuse Tax elections, offset by certain foreign jurisdictions projecting current income tax expense.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
As of December 31, 2020, our principal sources of liquidity have been cash provided by operations. Our cash and cash equivalents balance was $33.7 million at December 31, 2020. We anticipate that our principal uses of cash and cash equivalents will be to fund our business, including technology expansion and working capital.
At December 31, 2020, our non-U.S. subsidiaries held approximately $6.2 million of cash and cash equivalents that are available for use by all of our operations around the world. At this time, we believe the funds held by all non-U.S. subsidiaries will be permanently reinvested outside of the U.S. However, if these funds were repatriated to the U.S. or used for U.S. operations, certain amounts could be subject to U.S. tax for the incremental amount in excess of the foreign tax paid. Due to the timing and circumstances of repatriation of these earnings, if any, it is not practical to determine the unrecognized deferred tax liability related to the amount.
We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents, credit facility, and our ability to manage working capital and expected positive cash flows generated from operations in combination with continued expense reductions will be sufficient to fund our operations for the next twelve months from the date of filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. However, as the impact of
the COVID-19 pandemic on the economy and our operations evolves, we will continue to assess our liquidity needs. Given the economic uncertainty as a result of the pandemic, we have taken actions to improve our current liquidity position, including, reducing working capital, reducing operating costs and substantially reducing discretionary spending. Even with these actions however, an extended period of economic disruption as a result of COVID-19 could materially affect our business, results of operations, ability to meet debt covenants, access to sources of liquidity and financial condition. Our liquidity plans are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those described in the ""Forward-Looking Statements"" section of this MD&A and Part I, Item 1A. “Risk Factors”, some of which are outside of our control.
Convertible Senior Notes
The Company paid off the remaining carrying amount of the convertible senior notes on August 15, 2019. For further details, see Note 12. Debt of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.
2019 Revolving Credit Facility
On October 4, 2019, the Company entered into a Credit Agreement with Citizens Bank, N.A., for a $10.0 million Revolving Credit Facility. Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at a rate equal to, at the Company’s option, either (1) the arithmetic average of the LIBOR rate determined by reference to the costs of funds for U.S. dollar deposits for the interest period (one, three or six months (or 12 months if agreed to by all applicable Lenders)) as selected by the Company relevant to such borrowing plus the applicable margin, or (2) a base rate determined by reference to the greatest of the federal funds rate plus 0.50%, the prime commercial lending rate as determined by the Agent, and the daily LIBOR rate plus 1.00%, in each case plus an applicable margin and subject to a floor of 0.00%. In addition, on a quarterly basis, the Company is required to pay each lender under the Revolving Credit Facility a 0.2% commitment fee on the undrawn balance under the Revolving Credit Facility, which may be subject to adjustment based on the Company’s total leverage ratio.
In the first quarter of fiscal 2020, the Company drew the $10.0 million from our Revolving Credit Facility, which remains outstanding as of December 31, 2020.
Shares of Preferred Stock
In accordance with the terms of the Share Purchase Agreement dated as of October 17, 2017 (the “PIPE Purchase Agreement”), with Silver Private Holdings I, LLC, an affiliate of Siris (“Silver”), on February 15, 2018, we issued to Silver 185,000 shares of our newly issued Series A Preferred Stock, par value $0.0001 per share, with an initial liquidation preference of $1,000 per share, in exchange for $97.7 million in cash and the transfer from Silver to us of the 5,994,667 shares of our common stock held by Silver (the “Preferred Transaction”). In connection with the issuance of the Series A Preferred Stock, we (i) filed the Series A Certificate and (ii) entered into an Investor Rights Agreement with Silver setting forth certain registration, governance and preemptive rights of Silver with respect to us (the “Investor Rights Agreement”). Pursuant to the PIPE Purchase Agreement, at the closing, we paid to Siris $5.0 million as a reimbursement of Silver’s costs and expenses incurred in connection with the Preferred Transaction.
Certificate of Designation of the Series A Preferred Stock
The rights, preferences, privileges, qualifications, restrictions and limitations of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock are set forth in the Series A Certificate. Under the Series A Certificate, the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock are entitled to receive Preferred Dividends. The Preferred Dividends are due on each Series A Dividend Payment Date. We may choose to pay the Preferred Dividends in cash or in additional shares of Series A Preferred Stock. In the event we do not declare and pay a dividend in-kind or in cash on any Series A Dividend Payment Date, the unpaid amount of the Preferred Dividend will be added to the Liquidation Preference. In addition, the Series A Preferred Stock participates in dividends declared and paid on shares of our common stock.
Each share of Series A Preferred Stock is convertible, at the option of the holder, into the number of shares of common stock equal to the “Conversion Price” (as that term is defined in the Series A Certificate) multiplied by the then applicable “Conversion Rate” (as that term is defined in the Series A Certificate). Each share of Series A Preferred Stock is initially convertible into 55.5556 shares of common stock, representing an initial “conversion price” of approximately $18.00 per share of common stock. The Conversion Rate is subject to equitable proportionate adjustment in the event of stock splits, recapitalizations and other events set forth in the Series A Certificate.
On and after the fifth anniversary of February 15, 2018, holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock have the right to cause the Company to redeem each share of Series A Preferred Stock for cash in an amount equal to the sum of the current
liquidation preference and any accrued dividends. Each share of Series A Preferred Stock is also redeemable at the option of the holder upon the occurrence of a “Fundamental Change” (as that term is defined in the Series A Certificate) at a specified premium (“Liquidation Value”). In addition, the Company is also permitted to redeem all outstanding shares of the Series A Preferred Stock at any time (i) within the first 30 months of the date of issuance for the sum of the then-applicable Liquidation Preference, accrued but unpaid dividends and a make whole amount (known as “Redemption Value”) and (ii) following the 30-month anniversary of the date of issuance for the sum of the then-applicable Liquidation Preference and the accrued but unpaid dividends. As of December 31, 2020, the Liquidation Value and Redemption Value of the Preferred Shares was $243.1 million.
The holders of a majority of the Series A Preferred Stock, voting separately as a class, are entitled at each of our annual meetings of stockholders or at any special meeting called for the purpose of electing directors (or by written consent signed by the holders of a majority of the then-outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock in lieu of such a meeting): (i) to nominate and elect two members of our Board of Directors for so long as the Preferred Percentage (as defined in the Series A Certificate) is equal to or greater than 10%; and (ii) to nominate and elect one member of our Board of Directors for so long as the Preferred Percentage is equal to or greater than 5% but less than 10%.
For so long as the holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock have the right to nominate at least one director, we are required to obtain the prior approval of Silver prior to taking certain actions, including: (i) certain dividends, repayments and redemptions; (ii) any amendment to our certificate of incorporation that adversely effects the rights, preferences, privileges or voting powers of the Series A Preferred Stock; (iii) issuances of stock ranking senior or equivalent to shares of Series A Preferred Stock (including additional shares of Series A Preferred Stock) in the priority of payment of dividends or in the distribution of assets upon any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of us; (iv) changes in the size of our Board of Directors; (v) any amendment, alteration, modification or repeal of the charter of our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of the Board of Directors and related documents; and (vi) any change in our principal business or the entry into any line of business outside of our existing lines of businesses. In addition, in the event that we are in EBITDA Non-Compliance (as defined in the Series A Certificate) or the undertaking of certain actions would result in us exceeding a specified pro forma leverage ratio, then the prior approval of Silver would be required to incur indebtedness (or alter any debt document) in excess of $10.0 million, enter or consummate any transaction where the fair market value exceeds $5.0 million individually or $10.0 million in the aggregate in a fiscal year or authorize or commit to capital expenditures in excess of $25.0 million in a fiscal year.
Each holder of Series A Preferred Stock has one vote per share on any matter on which holders of Series A Preferred Stock are entitled to vote separately as a class, whether at a meeting or by written consent. The holders of Series A Preferred Stock are permitted to take any action or consent to any action with respect to such rights without a meeting by delivering a consent in writing or electronic transmission of the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock entitled to cast not less than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize, take or consent to such action at a meeting of stockholders. In addition to any vote (or action taken by written consent) of the holders of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock as a separate class provided for in the Series A Certificate or by the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, the holders of shares of the Series A Preferred Stock are entitled to vote with the holders of shares of common stock (and any other class or series that may similarly be entitled to vote on an as-converted basis with the holders of common stock) on all matters submitted to a vote or to the consent of the stockholders of the Company (including the election of directors) as one class.
Under the Series A Certificate, if Silver and certain of its affiliates have elected to effect a conversion of some or all of their shares of Series A Preferred Stock and if the sum, without duplication, of (i) the aggregate number of shares of our common stock issued to such holders upon such conversion and any shares of our common stock previously issued to such holders upon conversion of Series A Preferred Stock and then held by such holders, plus (ii) the number of shares of our common stock underlying shares of Series A Preferred Stock that would be held at such time by such holders (after giving effect to such conversion), would exceed the 19.9% of the issued and outstanding shares of our voting stock on an as converted basis (the “Conversion Cap”), then such holders would only be entitled to convert such number of shares as would result in the sum of clauses (i) and (ii) (after giving effect to such conversion) being equal to the Conversion Cap (after giving effect to any such limitation on conversion). Any shares of Series A Preferred Stock which a holder has elected to convert but which, by reason of the previous sentence, are not so converted, will be treated as if the holder had not made such election to convert and such shares of Series A Preferred Stock will remain outstanding. Also, under the Series A Certificate, if the sum, without duplication, of (i) the aggregate voting power of the shares previously issued to Silver and certain of its affiliates held by such holders at the record date, plus (ii) the aggregate voting power of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock held by such holders as of such record date, would exceed 19.99% of the total voting power of our outstanding voting stock at such record date, then, with respect to such shares, Silver and certain of its affiliates are only entitled to cast a number of votes equal to 19.99% of such total voting power. The limitation on conversion and voting ceases to apply upon receipt of the requisite approval of holders of our common stock under the applicable listing standards.
Investor Rights Agreement
Concurrently with the closing of the Preferred Transaction, Synchronoss and Silver entered into an Investor Rights Agreement. Under the terms of the Investor Rights Agreement, Silver and Synchronoss have agreed that, effective as of the closing of the Preferred Transaction, the Board of Directors of Synchronoss will consist of ten members. From and after the closing of the Preferred Transaction, so long as the holders of Series A Preferred Stock have the right to nominate a member to the Board of Directors pursuant to the Series A Certificate, the Board of Directors of Synchronoss will consist of (i) two directors nominated and elected by the holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock; (ii) four directors who meet the independence criteria set forth in the applicable listing standards (each of whom will be initially agreed upon by Synchronoss and Silver); and (iii) four other directors, two of whom shall satisfy the independence criteria of the applicable listing standards and, as of the closing of the Preferred Transaction, one of whom shall be the individual then serving as chief executive officer of Synchronoss and one of whom shall be the current chairman of the Board of Directors of Synchronoss as of the date of execution of the Investors Rights Agreement. Following the closing of the Preferred Transaction, so long as the holders of Series A Preferred Stock have the right to nominate at least one director to the Board of Directors of Synchronoss pursuant to the Series A Certificate, Silver will have the right to designate two members of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of the Board of Directors.
Pursuant to the terms of the Investor Rights Agreement, neither Silver nor its affiliates may transfer any shares of Series A Preferred Stock subject to certain exceptions (including transfers to affiliates that agree to be bound by the terms of the Investor Rights Agreement).
For so long as Silver has the right to appoint a director to the Board of Directors of Synchronoss, without the prior approval by a majority of directors voting who are not appointed by the holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock, neither Silver nor its affiliates will directly or indirectly purchase or acquire any debt or equity securities of Synchronoss (including equity-linked derivative securities) if such purchase or acquisition would result in Silver’s Standstill Percentage (as defined in the Investor Rights Agreement) being in excess of 30%. However, the foregoing standstill restrictions would not prohibit the purchase of shares pursuant to the PIPE Purchase Agreement or the receipt of shares of Series A Preferred Stock issued as Preferred Dividends pursuant to the Series A Certificate, shares of Common Stock received upon conversion of shares of Series A Preferred Stock or receipt of any shares of Series A Preferred Stock, Common Stock or other securities of the Company otherwise paid as dividends or as an increase of the Liquidation Preference (as defined in the Series A Certificate) or distributions thereon. Silver will also have preemptive rights with respect to issuances of securities of Synchronoss in order to maintain its ownership percentage.
Under the terms of the Investor Rights Agreement, Silver will be entitled to (i) three demand registrations, with no more than two demand registrations in any single calendar year and provided that each demand registration must include at least 10% of the shares of Common Stock held by Silver, including shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of shares of Series A Preferred Stock and (ii) unlimited piggyback registration rights with respect to primary issuances and all other issuances.
Discussion of Cash Flows
A summary of net cash flows follows (in thousands):
Twelve Months Ended December 31, Change Change
2020 2019 2018 2020 vs 2019 2019 vs 2018
Net cash provided by (used in):
Operating activities $ (564) $ 32,583 $ (31,369) $ (33,147) $ 63,952
Investing activities (14,339) 19,377 (67,282) (33,716) 86,659
Financing activities 9,991 (121,257) (35,885) 131,248 (85,372)
Our primary source of cash is receipts from revenue. The primary uses of cash are personnel and related costs, telecommunications and facility costs related primarily to our cost of revenue and general operating expenses including professional service fees, consulting fees, building and equipment maintenance and marketing expense.
Cash flows from operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 was a $0.6 million of cash used by operating activities, as compared to $32.6 million of cash provided by operating activities for the same period in 2019. The decrease of cash used by operating activities of $33.1 million was primarily due to favorable changes in cash earnings of $21.4 million offset by an unfavorable change in working capital of $70.2 million. The main driver of the unfavorable movement in working
capital was the continued run-off of the deferred revenue balance which is in line with our business as our customers shift away from larger prepayments of services.
Cash flows from operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $32.6 million of cash provided by operating activities, as compared to $31.4 million of cash used by operating activities for the same period in 2018. The increase of cash provided by operating activities of $64.0 million was primarily due to favorable changes in cash earnings of $16.1 million, a $20.7 million tax refund and a favorable change in working capital of $27.1 million.
Cash flows from investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $14.3 million of cash used by investing activities, as compared to $19.4 million in cash provided by investing activities during the same period in 2019. The cash used for investing in the current year was primarily related to the $16.7 million investment in capitalized software offset by the sale of certain IP address assets. The net decrease in cash from investing activities from the prior year mainly related to the net proceeds from the purchases and sales of marketable securities in the prior year that were not present in the current period.
Cash flows from investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $19.4 million of cash provided by investing activities, as compared to $67.3 million in cash used for investing activities during the same period in 2018. The 2019 cash provided from investing activities was driven by the sale of marketable securities offset by our continued investment in capitalized software. The increased spend in 2018 was due primarily to purchase marketable securities and fund the Honeybee acquisition.
Cash flows from financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $10.0 million of cash provided, as compared to $121.3 million of cash used by financing activities for the same period in 2019. The cash provided from investing activities was attributable to the $10.0 million drawdown from our Revolving Credit Facility. The net change in cash provided from financing activities from the prior year is primarily attributable to the cash provided from the Revolving Credit Facility offset by repayments for our Convertible Senior Notes in 2019.
Cash flows from financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $121.3 million use of cash, as compared to $35.9 million of cash used by financing activities for the same period in 2018. The cash used for financing activities was mainly attributable to the repayment of the convertible debt in August 2019.
Effect of Inflation
Although inflation generally affects us by increasing our cost of labor and equipment, we do not believe that inflation has had any material effect on our results of operations during 2020, 2019 and 2018. We do not expect the current rate of inflation to have a material impact on our business for the foreseeable future.
Contractual Obligations
Our contractual obligations consist of contingent consideration, office equipment and colocation services and contractual commitments under third-party hosting, software licenses and maintenance agreements. The following table summarizes our long-term contractual obligations as of December 31, 2020 (in thousands).

Total $ 127,480 $ 25,485 $ 65,335 $ 26,066 $ 10,594
_______________________________
* Amount represents customer delivery related purchase obligations.
Uncertain Tax Positions
Unrecognized tax positions are $3.3 million at December 31, 2020. We are not able to reasonably estimate when we would make any cash payments required to settle these liabilities, but we do not believe that the ultimate settlement of our obligations will materially affect our liquidity. We do not expect that the balance of unrecognized tax benefits will significantly increase or decrease over the next twelve months.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires us to utilize accounting policies and make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingencies as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during a fiscal period. We have discussed the selection and development of the critical accounting policies with the Audit Committee, and the Audit Committee has reviewed our related disclosures in this Form 10-K. Although we believe that our judgments and estimates are appropriate, correct and reasonable under the circumstances, actual results may differ from those estimates. If actual results or events differ materially from those contemplated by us in making these estimates, our reported financial condition and results of operations for future periods could be materially affected. See Part I, “Item 1A. Risk Factors” in this Form 10-K for certain matters bearing risks on our future results of operations.
We believe the following to be our critical accounting policies because they are important to the portrayal of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations and they require critical management judgments and estimates about matters that are uncertain.
Significant accounting policies that we employ are presented in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. There were no significant changes in our critical accounting policies and estimates discussed in our Form 10-K during the year ended December 31, 2020.
Revenue Recognition and Deferred Revenue
The Company generates revenue from the delivery of a range of products, solutions and services for operators, enterprises, OEMs and technology providers. We offer services principally on a Transactional or Subscription basis (SaaS) or in the form of Professional Services or Software Licenses. Revenues are recognized when control of the promised goods or services are transferred to the Company’s customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration that the Company expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. The Company generates all of its revenue from contracts with customers.
Subscription and Transaction revenues consist of revenues derived from the processing of transactions through the Company’s service platforms, providing enterprise portal management services on a subscription basis and maintenance agreements on software licenses. The Company generates revenue from Subscription services from monthly active user fees, software as a service (“SaaS”) fees, hosting and storage fees, and fees for the related maintenance support for those services. In most cases, the subscription or transaction arrangement is a single performance obligation comprised of a series of distinct services that are substantially the same and that have the same pattern of transfer (i.e., distinct days of service). The Company applies a measure of progress (typically time-based) to any fixed consideration and allocates variable consideration to the distinct periods of service based on usage, under Topic 606 Section 10-25-14(b). When the Company does not allocate variable consideration to distinct periods of service, the total estimated transaction price is recognized ratably over the term of the contract, where the level of service provided to the customer does not vary significantly from one period to another.
Transaction service arrangements include services such as processing equipment orders, new account setup and activation, number port requests, credit checks and inventory management. Transaction revenues are principally based on a contractual price per transaction and are recognized based on the number of transactions processed during each reporting period. Revenues are recorded based on the total number of transactions processed at the applicable price established in the relevant contract.
Many of the Company’s contracts guarantee minimum volume transactions from the customer. In these instances, if the customer’s total estimated transaction volume for the period is expected to be less than the contractual amount, the Company records revenues at the minimum guaranteed amount on a straight line based over the period covered by the minimum. Setup fees for transactional service arrangements are deferred until set up activities are completed and recognized on a straight-line basis over remaining expected customer relationship period. Revenues are presented net of discounts, which are volume level driven.
In accordance with Topic 606 Section 10-50-20, any credits due to customers, which are generally performance driven and based upon system availability or response times to incidents, are determined and accounted for in the period in which the services are provided. The Company recognizes revenues from support and maintenance performance obligations over the service delivery period.
The Company’s software licenses typically provide for a perpetual or term right to use the Company’s software. The Company has concluded that in most cases its software license is distinct as the customer can benefit from the software on its own. Software revenue is typically recognized when the software is delivered to the customer. Contracts that include software customization or specified upgrades may result in the combination of the customization services with the software license as one performance obligation. The Company does not have a history of returns, or refunds of is software licenses, however, in limited instances, the Company may constrain consideration to high-risk customers, until collection is resolved.
The Company’s professional services include software development and customization. The contracts generally include project deliverables specified by each customer. The performance obligations in the agreements are generally combined into one deliverable and generally result in the transfer of control over time. The underlying deliverable is owned and controlled by the customer and does not create an asset with an alternative use to us. The Company recognizes revenue on fixed fee contracts on the proportion of labor hours expended to the total hours expected to complete the contract performance obligation.
Most of the Company’s contracts with customers contain multiple performance obligations which generally include either 1) a perpetual software license with support and maintenance and sometimes a hosting agreement or 2) a term SaaS agreement, in many cases these are sold along with professional services. For these contracts, the Company accounts for individual goods and services separately if they are distinct performance obligations. This often requires significant judgment based upon knowledge of the products, the solution provided and the structure of the sales contract. In SaaS agreements, the Company provides a service to the customer which combines the software functionality, maintenance and hosting into a single performance obligation when the customer doesn’t have the ability to take possession of the underlying software license. The Company may also sell the same three goods and services in a contract, but there may be three performance obligations, where the customer has the right to take possession of the software license without significant penalty.
The transaction price is allocated to the separate performance obligations on a relative standalone selling price basis. The Company estimates standalone selling prices of software based on observable inputs of past transactions to similarly situated customers. When such observable data is not available for certain software licenses because there is a limited number of transactions or prices are highly variable, the Company will estimate the standalone selling price using the residual approach. Standalone selling prices of services are typically determined based on observable transactions when these services are sold on a standalone basis to similarly situated customers or estimated using a cost-plus margin approach.
Estimating the transaction price of variable consideration including the variable quantity subscription or transaction contracts in a multiple performance obligation arrangement requires significant judgment. The Company generally estimates this variable consideration at the most likely amount to which the Company expects to be entitled and in certain cases based on the expected value. The Company includes estimated amounts in the transaction price to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is resolved. The Company’s estimates of variable consideration and determination of whether to include estimated amounts in the transaction price are based largely on an assessment of the Company’s anticipated performance and all information (historical, current and forecasted) that is reasonably available to us. The Company reviews and updates these estimates on a quarterly basis.
Stock-Based Compensation
As of December 31, 2020, we maintain eight stock-based compensation plans. We utilize the Black-Scholes pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options on the dates of grant. Restricted stock awards are measured based on the fair market values of the underlying stock on the dates of grant. We recognize stock-based compensation over the requisite service period with an offsetting credit to additional paid-in capital.
For our performance restricted stock awards and units, we estimate the number of shares the recipient is to receive by applying a probability of achieving the performance goals. The actual number of shares the recipient receives is determined at the end of the performance period based on the results achieved versus goals based on our performance targets, such as revenue, EBITDA and Total Shareholder Return (TSR). Once the number of awards is determined, the compensation cost is fixed and continues to be recognized using straight line recognition over the requisite service period for each vesting tranche.
Use of a valuation model requires management to make certain assumptions with respect to selected model inputs. Expected volatility was calculated based on the historical information of our stock. The average expected life was determined using historical stock option exercise activity. The risk-free interest rate is based on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with a remaining term equal to the expected life assumed at the date of grant. We have never declared or paid cash dividends on our common equity and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Forfeitures are accounted for as they occur.
Income Taxes
On December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted TCJA. The TCJA made changes to the corporate tax rate, business-related deductions and taxation of foreign earnings, among others, that are generally effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017.
In March 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (“CARES Act”) was signed into law. The CARES Act provides numerous tax provisions and other stimulus measures, including temporary changes regarding the prior and future utilization of net operating losses. The CARES Act amends the Net Operating Loss provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, allowing for the carryback of losses arising in tax years 2018, 2019 and 2020, to each of the five taxable years preceding the taxable year of loss.
Since we conduct operations on a global basis, our effective tax rate has and will depend upon the geographic distribution of our pre-tax earnings among locations with varying tax rates. We account for the effects of income taxes that result from our activities during the current and preceding years. Under this method, deferred income tax liabilities and assets are based on the difference between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect in the years in which the differences are expected to reverse or be utilized. The realization of deferred tax assets is contingent upon the generation of future taxable income. A valuation allowance is recorded if it is “more likely than not” that a portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized.
In evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets within the jurisdiction from which they arise, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax-planning strategies, and results of recent operations. In projecting future taxable income, we begin with historical results and incorporate assumptions including the amount of future state, federal and foreign pretax operating income, the reversal of temporary differences, and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax-planning strategies. These assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses.
We recognize a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination based on the technical merits of the position. The amount of the accrual for which an exposure exists is measured by determining the amount that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon the settlement of the position. Components of the reserve are classified as current or a long-term liability in the Consolidated Balance Sheets based on when we expect each of the items to be settled. We record interest and penalties accrued in relation to uncertain tax benefits as a component of interest expense.
While we believe we have identified all reasonably identifiable exposures and that the reserve we have established for identifiable exposures is appropriate under the circumstances, it is possible that additional exposures exist and that exposures may be settled at amounts different than the amounts reserved. It is also possible that changes in facts and circumstances could cause us to either materially increase or reduce the carrying amount of our tax reserves. In general, tax returns for the year 2017 and thereafter are subject to future examination by tax authorities.
Our policy has been to leave our cumulative unremitted foreign earnings invested indefinitely outside the United States, and we intend to continue this policy. Although the transition tax in the TCJA has removed U.S. federal taxes on distributions to the U.S. on a go forward basis, the Company continues to assert permanent reinvestment of foreign earnings. Due to the timing and circumstances of repatriation of such earnings, if any, it is not practicable to determine the unrecognized deferred tax liability relating to such amounts.
Business Combinations
We account for business combinations in accordance with the acquisition method. The acquisition method of accounting requires that assets acquired, and liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree (if any), be recorded at their fair values on the date of a business acquisition. Our consolidated financial statements and results of operations reflect an acquired business from the completion date of the transaction.
The judgments that we make in determining the estimated fair value assigned to each class of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, as well as asset lives, can materially impact net income in periods following a business combination. We generally use either the income, cost or market approach to aid in our conclusions of such fair values and asset lives. The income approach presumes that the value of an asset can be estimated by the net economic benefit to be received over the life of the
asset, discounted to present value. The cost approach presumes that an investor would pay no more for an asset than its replacement or reproduction cost. The market approach estimates value based on what other participants in the market have paid for reasonably similar assets. Although each valuation approach is considered in valuing the assets acquired, the approach ultimately selected is based on the characteristics of the asset and the availability of information.
We record contingent consideration resulting from a business combination at its fair value on the acquisition date. Each reporting period thereafter, we revalue these obligations and record increases or decreases in their fair value as an adjustment to net change in contingent consideration obligation within the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration obligation can result from updates in the achievement of financial or other operational targets and changes to the weighted probability of achieving those future targets. Significant judgment is employed in determining the appropriateness of these assumptions as of the acquisition date and for each subsequent period. Accordingly, any change in the assumptions described above, could have a material impact on the amount of the net change in contingent consideration obligation that we record in any given period.
Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of assets acquired, including other definite-lived intangible assets. Our policy is to perform an impairment test of goodwill at least annually, and more frequently if events or circumstances occurred that would indicate a reduced fair value in our reporting units could exist. Typically, we perform a qualitative assessment in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. As part of this qualitative assessment, we perform a quantitative assessment where necessary in substantiating our qualitative assessment.
During our qualitative assessment we make significant estimates, assumptions, and judgments, around the financial performance of the Company, changes in our share price, and forecasts of earnings, working capital requirements, and cash flows. We consider each reporting unit's historical results and operating trends as well as any strategic difference from our historical results when determining these assumptions.
If we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill, we perform a quantitative goodwill impairment test. Fair value estimates used in the quantitative impairment test are calculated using a combination of the income and market approaches. The income approach is based on the present value of future cash flows of each reporting unit, while the market approach is based on certain multiples of selected guideline public companies or selected guideline transactions. The approaches incorporate a number of market participant assumptions including future growth rates, discount rates, income tax rates and market activity in assessing fair value and are reporting unit specific. If the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit's fair value, we recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit's fair value.
The fair value measurement associated with the quantitative goodwill impairment test is based on significant inputs that are not observable in the market and thus represents a Level 3 measurement. Significant changes in the underlying assumptions used to value goodwill could significantly increase or decrease the fair value estimates used for impairment assessments.
For our 2020 impairment tests, the Company identified one reporting unit, Core. The Company performed a quantitative impairment assessment, as of October 1, 2020, for the Core reporting unit. The amounts below represent the results of our quantitative assessment.
We use the average of our fair values for purposes of our comparison between carrying value and fair value for the quantitative impairment test. The table below depicts the methods employed, assumptions used and percentage fair value in excess of carrying value.
2020 Impairment Test
Reporting Unit Discount Rate Growth rate range Terminal Growth Rate Goodwill Fair Value Exceeds Carrying Value by Fair Value method
Core 13.0 % 2.0 - 13.0% 2.0 % $ 227,012 45.1 % Income Approach, Market Approach
The 2020 fair value of the reporting unit was estimated using a combination of the income approach, which incorporates the use of the discounted cash flow method, and the market approach, which incorporates the use of earnings and revenue
multiples based on market data. We generally applied an equal weighting to the income and market approaches for our analysis when both are applied.
For the income approach, we used projections, which require the use of significant estimates and assumptions specific to the reporting unit as well as those based on general economic conditions. Factors specific to each reporting unit include revenue and cost growth, profit margins, terminal value growth rates, capital expenditures projections, assumed tax rates, discount rates and other assumptions deemed reasonable by management.
For the market approach, we used judgment in identifying the relevant comparable-company market multiples. These estimates and assumptions may vary between each reporting unit depending on the facts and circumstances specific to that unit. If sufficient comparable data is not present, the market approach will not be employed. The discount rate for each reporting unit is influenced by general market conditions as well as factors specific to the reporting unit.
Factors influencing the revenue growth rates include the nature of the services the reporting unit provides for its clients, the maturity of the reporting unit and any known concentrated customer contract renewals. We believe that the estimates and assumptions we made are reasonable, but they are susceptible to change from period to period. Actual results of operations, cash flows and other factors will likely differ from the estimates used in our valuation, and it is possible that differences and changes could be material.
A deterioration in profitability, adverse market conditions, significant client losses, changes in spending levels of our existing clients or a different economic outlook than currently estimated by management could have a significant impact on the estimated fair value of our reporting units and could result in an impairment charge in the future.
Capitalized Software Development Costs
Software development costs are accounted for in accordance with either ASC 985-20, “Software - Costs of Software to be Sold, Leased or Marketed,” or ASC 350-40, “Internal-Use Software.” Costs associated with the planning and designing phase of software development are classified as research and development costs and are expensed as incurred. The amounts capitalized include external direct costs of services used in developing internal-use software, employee compensation and related expenses of personnel directly associated with the development activities. Once technological feasibility has been determined, a portion of the costs incurred in development, including coding, testing and quality assurance, are capitalized until available for general release to clients.
Amortization is calculated on a solution-by-solution basis and is recognized over the estimated economic life of the software, typically ranging two to three years. Amortization begins when the software is substantially completed for its intended use. Costs incurred during the preliminary and post-implementation stages are expensed as incurred. The amounts capitalized include external direct costs of services used in developing internal-use software, employee compensation and related expenses of personnel directly associated with the development activities. Software development costs are evaluated for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. Unrecoverable costs are reviewed annually and recognized in the period they become unrecoverable, as needed, and are recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Operations as depreciation and amortization expense.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
A review of long-lived assets for impairment is performed when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable. If an indication of impairment is present, the Company compares the estimated undiscounted future cash flows to be generated by the asset to the asset’s carrying amount. If the undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset, the Company records an impairment loss equal to the amount by which the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its fair value. The fair value is determined based on valuation techniques such as a comparison to fair values of similar assets or using a discounted cash flow analysis.
This fair value measurement is based on significant inputs that are not observable in the market and thus represents a Level 3 measurement. Significant changes in the underlying assumptions used to value long lived assets could significantly increase or decrease the fair value estimates used for impairment assessments.
Long lived assets that do not have indefinite lives are amortized/depreciated over their useful lives and reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. The Company reevaluates the useful life determinations each year to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining useful lives.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We had no off-balance sheet arrangements as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019.","ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
Market Risk
The following discussion about market risk disclosures involves forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. We deposit our excess cash in what we believe are high-quality financial instruments, primarily money market funds and certificates of deposit and, we may be exposed to market risks related to changes in interest rates. We do not actively manage the risk of interest rate fluctuations on our marketable securities; however, such risk is mitigated by the relatively short-term nature of these investments. These investments are denominated in United States dollars.
The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve our capital for the purpose of funding operations, while at the same time maximizing the income, we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk. To achieve these objectives, our investment policy allows us to maintain a portfolio of cash equivalents and short- and long-term investments in a variety of securities, which could include commercial paper, money market funds and corporate and government debt securities. Our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 were invested in liquid money market accounts, certificates of deposit and government securities. All market-risk sensitive instruments were entered into for non-trading purposes.
Foreign Currency Exchange Risk
We are exposed to translation risk because certain of our foreign operations utilize the local currency as their functional currency and those financial results must be translated into U.S. dollars. As currency exchange rates fluctuate, translation of the financial statements of foreign businesses into U.S. dollars affects the comparability of financial results between years.
We do not hold any derivative instruments and do not engage in any hedging activities. Although our reporting currency is the U.S. dollar, we may conduct business and incur costs in the local currencies of other countries in which we may operate, make sales and buy materials and services. As a result, we are subject to foreign currency transaction risk. Further, changes in exchange rates between foreign currencies and the U.S. dollar could affect our future net sales, cost of sales and expenses and could result in foreign currency transaction gains or losses.
We cannot accurately predict future exchange rates or the overall impact of future exchange rate fluctuations on our business, results of operations and financial condition. To the extent that our international activities recorded in local currencies increase in the future, our exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates will correspondingly increase and hedging activities may be considered if appropriate.
Interest Rate Risk
We are exposed to the risk of interest rate fluctuations on the interest income earned on our cash and cash equivalents, and our revolving credit facility. A hypothetical 100 basis point movement in interest rates applicable to our cash and cash equivalents outstanding at December 31, 2020 would increase interest income by approximately $0.3 million on an annual basis. Borrowings under the revolving credit facility bear interest at a rate equal to, at our option, either (1) the arithmetic average of the LIBOR rate determined by reference to the costs of funds for U.S. dollar deposits for the interest period (one, three or six months (or 12 months if agreed to by all applicable Lenders)) as selected by us relevant to such borrowing plus the applicable margin, or (2) a base rate determined by reference to the greatest of the federal funds rate plus 0.50%, the prime commercial lending rate as determined by the Agent, and the daily LIBOR rate plus 1.00%, in each case plus an applicable margin and subject to a floor of 0.00%.","ITEM 8.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Synchronoss Technologies, Inc.:
Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Synchronoss Technologies, Inc. (the Company) as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive (loss) income, stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, and the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a)(2) (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated March 15, 2021 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matters
The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.
Subscription and license revenue- Identifying contracts, performance obligations and stand-alone selling price
Description of the Matter
As discussed in Note 3. Revenue of the financial statements, the Company recognized $230 million in subscription and license revenue. The related revenue agreements frequently contain multiple performance obligations, and judgment is required to determine which performance obligations are distinct and accounted for separately. These agreements may also contain variable consideration in the form of tiered pricing, contractual minimums or discounts. Judgment is also required to estimate the total contract consideration and to allocate the consideration to each distinct performance obligation. Additionally, the Company enters into multiple agreements with the same customer, which may affect the identification of the contract, the performance obligations and the allocation of total contract consideration. Auditing the Company’s subscription and license revenue was complex and involved a high degree of judgment related to management’s identification of performance obligations and its estimate and allocation of contract consideration.
How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit
We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of internal controls related to the Company’s process for recognizing subscription and license revenue, including controls over management’s review of the significant judgments and estimates used in the identification of the contract, distinct performance obligations and the estimation and allocation of amounts to each performance obligation.
Our audit procedures also included, among others, reading a sample of customer contracts and evaluating management’s identification of the contract and the distinct performance obligations based on the terms of the arrangements and the Company’s accounting policies. To test the calculation of the amount of consideration allocated to each distinct performance obligation, we performed procedures to evaluate management’s judgments related to the allocation of consideration to each distinct performance obligation and performed sensitivity analyses to evaluate how these assumptions affect the amount of revenue recognized. We have also evaluated the adequacy of the Company’s disclosures included in Note 3. Revenue.
Goodwill
Description of the Matter
At December 31, 2020, the Company's goodwill balance was $232 million. As discussed in Note 9. Goodwill and Intangibles of the consolidated financial statements, goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually on October 1 at the reporting unit level. Auditing the Company's goodwill impairment test was complex due to the significant judgment required in determining the fair value of the reporting unit. In particular, the fair value estimate was sensitive to significant assumptions that require judgment, including revenue growth rates, free cash flow and operating expenses as a percentage of revenue that affect the amount and timing of future cash flows, long-term growth rates, and the weighted average cost of capital (""discount rate""), which are affected by factors such as general market conditions and recent operating performance.
How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit
We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company's goodwill impairment review process. For example, we tested controls over management's review of the valuation model and the significant assumptions, discussed above used to develop the prospective financial information. We also tested management's controls to validate the data used in the valuation was complete and accurate.
To test the estimated fair value of the Company's reporting unit, we performed audit procedures that included, among others, assessing the reasonableness of the methodologies used. We also compared the significant assumptions used by management to develop the prospective financial information to current industry and economic trends, analyst expectations, changes to the Company's business model, customer base or product mix and other relevant information. We assessed the historical accuracy of management's projections of future earnings by comparing the actual results to prior forecasts, and we performed analyses of significant assumptions to assess the impact of changes in the assumptions on the calculation of fair value. Further, we evaluated the revenue growth rates, free cash flow, operating expenses as a percentage of revenue and long term growth rates in comparison to the Company’s peers. We also involved our valuation specialists to assist with our evaluation of the methodology used by the Company and significant assumptions included in the fair value estimates. We have also evaluated the adequacy of the Company’s disclosures included in Note 9. Goodwill and Intangibles.

1. Description of Business
General
Synchronoss Technologies, Inc. (“Synchronoss” or the “Company”) Digital, Cloud, Messaging and Total Network Management platforms help the world’s leading companies, including operators, original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”), and Media and Technology providers to deliver continuously transformative customer experiences that create high value engagement and new monetization opportunities.
The Company currently operates in and markets solutions and services directly through the Company’s sales organizations in North America, Europe and Asia-Pacific. The Company’s platforms give customers new opportunities in the Telecommunications, Media and Technology (“TMT”) space, taking advantage of the rapidly converging services, connected devices, networks and applications.
The Company delivers platforms, products and solutions including:
•White Label Personal Cloud: Cloud sync, backup, storage, device set up, content transfer and content engagement for user generated content.
•Messaging: White label consumer email solutions. Advanced, multi-channel messaging peer-to-peer (“P2P”) communications and application-to-person (“A2P”) commerce solutions.
•Digital: Customer journey and workflow design, development, orchestration and experience management.

The Synchronoss Personal Cloud™ platform is a secure and highly scalable white label platform designed to store and sync subscriber’s personally created content seamlessly to and from current and new devices. This allows a carrier’s customers to protect, engage with and manage their personal content and gives the Company’s Operator customers the ability to increase average revenue per user (“ARPU”) through a new monthly recurring charge (“MRC”) and opportunities to mine valuable data that will give subscribers access to new, beneficial services. Additionally, the Company’s Personal Cloud Platform performs an expanding set of value-add services including facilitating an Operator’s initial device setup and enhancing visibility and control across disparate devices within subscribers’ smart homes.
The Synchronoss Messaging Platform powers hundreds of millions of subscribers’ mail boxes worldwide. The Company’s Advanced Messaging Product is a powerful, secure and intelligent white label messaging platform that expands capabilities for Operators and TMT companies to offer P2P messaging via Rich Communications Services (“RCS”). Additionally, the Company’s Advanced Messaging Product powers commerce and a robust ecosystem for Operators, brands and advertisers to execute Application to Person (“A2P”) commerce and data-rich dialogue with subscribers.
The Synchronoss Digital Platform is a suite of technology, tools and solutions that includes digital experience creation and management, automated provisioning, artificial intelligence and financial analytics that service a broad swatch of TMT markets. The products equip customers with a toolkit of capabilities where they can design, deploy and manage end user customer journeys and workflows easily and quickly from one central platform that also integrates across front end customer engagement channels as well as enterprise business systems (e.g. CRM, POS) allowing non-citizen developers to configure rather than code experiences. The platform sits between customer-facing touch points and a customer’s existing back-office systems to orchestrate data, workflows and processes into digital customer journeys that interface with end user channels creating user experiences that can be centrally managed and coordinated with less resources than is typical in a traditional IT environment.
The Synchronoss Total Network Management application suite provides Operators with the tools and software to design their physical network, streamline their infrastructure purchases, and comprehensive network expense optimization and management for leading top tier carriers around the globe.

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Basis of Presentation and Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company, its wholly-owned subsidiaries and variable interest entities (“VIE”) in which the Company is the primary beneficiary and entities in which the Company has a controlling interest. Investments in less than majority-owned companies in which the Company does not have a controlling interest, but does have significant influence, are accounted for as equity method investments. Investments in less than majority-owned companies in which the Company does not have the ability to exert significant influence over the operating and financial policies of the investee are accounted for using the cost method. All material intercompany transactions and accounts are eliminated in consolidation. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year’s presentation.
Risks and Uncertainties
There are many uncertainties regarding the current coronavirus (""COVID-19"") pandemic, and the Company is closely monitoring the impact of the pandemic on all aspects of its business, including how it will impact its customers, employees, suppliers, vendors, business partners and distribution channels. While the pandemic did not materially affect the Company’s financial results and business operations for the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company is unable to predict the impact that COVID-19 will have on its financial position and operating results due to numerous uncertainties. The Company will continue to assess the evolving impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and will make adjustments to its operations as necessary.
Recently Issued Accounting Standards
Recent accounting pronouncements adopted
Standard Description Effect on the financial statements
ASU 2016-13, ASU 2019-4 Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13 which replaces the incurred loss impairment methodology in current U.S. GAAP with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss estimates. The ASU is effective for public companies in annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019, and interim periods within those years. Early adoption is permitted beginning after December 15, 2018 and interim periods within those years. We adopted Topic 326 beginning on January 1, 2020 using the modified retrospective approach with a cumulative effect adjustment to opening retained earnings recorded at the beginning of the period of adoption. Upon adoption, we changed our impairment model to utilize a forward-looking current expected credit losses (CECL) model in place of the incurred loss methodology for financial instruments measured at amortized cost, including our accounts receivable. CECL estimates on accounts receivable are recorded as general and administrative expenses on our condensed consolidated statements of income. The cumulative effect adjustment from adoption was immaterial to our consolidated financial statements.
Date of adoption: January 1, 2020

Standards issued not yet adopted
Standard Description Effect on the financial statements
Update 2019-12 - Income Taxes (Topic 740) Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes The ASU removes the exception to the general principles in ASC 740, Income Taxes, associated with the incremental approach for intra-period tax allocation, accounting for basis differences when there are ownership changes in foreign investments and interim-period income tax accounting for year-to-date losses that exceed anticipated losses. In addition, the ASU improves the application of income tax related guidance and simplifies U.S. GAAP when accounting for franchise taxes that are partially based on income, transactions with government resulting in a step-up in tax basis goodwill, separate financial statements of legal entities not subject to tax, and enacted changes in tax laws in interim periods. Different transition approaches, retrospective, modified retrospective, or prospective, will apply to each income tax simplification provision. The Company continues to evaluate these changes and does not anticipate any material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial position or results of operations upon adoption.
Planned date of adoption: January 1, 2021.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Revenue Recognition
Revenues are recognized when control of the promised goods or services are transferred to the Company’s customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration that the Company expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. The Company generates all of its revenue from contracts with customers.
Subscription and Transaction revenues consist of revenues derived from the processing of transactions through the Company’s service platforms, providing enterprise portal management services on a subscription basis and maintenance agreements on software licenses. The Company generates revenue from Subscription services from monthly active user fees, software as a service (“SaaS”) fees, hosting and storage fees, and fees for the related maintenance support for those services. In most cases, the subscription or transaction arrangement is a single performance obligation comprised of a series of distinct services that are substantially the same and that have the same pattern of transfer (i.e., distinct days of service). The Company applies a measure of progress (typically time-based) to any fixed consideration and allocates variable consideration to the distinct periods of service based on usage, under Topic 606 Section 10-25-14(b). When the Company does not allocate variable consideration to distinct periods of service, the total estimated transaction price is recognized ratably over the term of the contract, where the level of service provided to the customer does not vary significantly from one period to another.
Transaction service arrangements include services such as processing equipment orders, new account setup and activation, number port requests, credit checks and inventory management.
Transaction revenues are principally based on a contractual price per transaction and are recognized based on the number of transactions processed during each reporting period. Revenues are recorded based on the total number of transactions processed at the applicable price established in the relevant contract.
Many of the Company’s contracts guarantee minimum volume transactions from the customer. In these instances, if the customer’s total estimated transaction volume for the period is expected to be less than the contractual amount, the Company records revenues at the minimum guaranteed amount on a straight line based over the period covered by the minimum. Setup fees for transactional service arrangements are deferred until set up activities are completed and recognized on a straight-line

basis over remaining expected customer relationship period. Revenues are presented net of discounts, which are volume level driven.
In accordance with Topic 606 Section 10-50-20, any credits due to customers, which are generally performance driven and based upon system availability or response times to incidents, are determined and accounted for in the period in which the services are provided. The Company recognizes revenues from support and maintenance performance obligations over the service delivery period.
The Company’s software licenses typically provide for a perpetual or term right to use the Company’s software. The Company has concluded that in most cases its software license is distinct as the customer can benefit from the software on its own. Software revenue is typically recognized when the software is delivered to the customer. Contracts that include software customization or specified upgrades may result in the combination of the customization services with the software license as one performance obligation. The Company does not have a history of returns, or refunds of is software licenses, however, in limited instances, the Company may constrain consideration to high-risk customers, until collection is resolved.
The Company’s professional services include software development and customization. The contracts generally include project deliverables specified by each customer. The performance obligations in the agreements are generally combined into one deliverable and generally result in the transfer of control over time. The underlying deliverable is owned and controlled by the customer and does not create an asset with an alternative use to us. The Company recognizes revenue on fixed fee contracts on the proportion of labor hours expended to the total hours expected to complete the contract performance obligation.
Most of the Company’s contracts with customers contain multiple performance obligations which generally include either 1) a perpetual software license with support and maintenance and sometimes a hosting agreement or 2) a term SaaS agreement, in many cases these are sold along with professional services. For these contracts, the Company accounts for individual goods and services separately if they are distinct performance obligations. This often requires significant judgment based upon knowledge of the products, the solution provided and the structure of the sales contract. In SaaS agreements, the Company provides a service to the customer which combines the software functionality, maintenance and hosting into a single performance obligation when the customer doesn’t have the ability to take possession of the underlying software license. The Company may also sell the same three goods and services in a contract, but there may be three performance obligations, where the customer has the right to take possession of the software license without significant penalty.
The transaction price is allocated to the separate performance obligations on a relative standalone selling price basis. The Company estimates standalone selling prices of software based on observable inputs of past transactions to similarly situated customers. When such observable data is not available for certain software licenses because there is a limited number of transactions or prices are highly variable, the Company will estimate the standalone selling price using the residual approach. Standalone selling prices of services are typically determined based on observable transactions when these services are sold on a standalone basis to similarly situated customers or estimated using a cost-plus margin approach.
Estimating the transaction price of variable consideration including the variable quantity subscription or transaction contracts in a multiple performance obligation arrangement requires significant judgment. The Company generally estimates this variable consideration at the most likely amount to which the Company expects to be entitled and in certain cases based on the expected value. The Company includes estimated amounts in the transaction price to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is resolved. The Company’s estimates of variable consideration and determination of whether to include estimated amounts in the transaction price are based largely on an assessment of the Company’s anticipated performance and all information (historical, current and forecasted) that is reasonably available. The Company reviews and update these estimates on a quarterly basis.

Deferred Revenue
Deferred revenues represent billings to customers for services in advance of the performance of services, with revenues recognized as the services are rendered, and also include the fair value of deferred revenues recorded as a result of acquisitions.
Service Level Standards
Pursuant to certain contracts, the Company is subject to service level standards and to corresponding penalties for failure to meet those standards. All performance-related penalties are reflected as a corresponding reduction of the Company’s revenues. These penalties, if applicable, are recorded in the month incurred and were insignificant for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
Cost of Revenues
Cost of services includes all direct materials, direct labor and those indirect costs related to revenues such as indirect labor, materials and supplies and facilities cost, exclusive of depreciation expense.
Research and Development
Software development costs are accounted for in accordance with either ASC 985-20, “Software - Costs of Software to be Sold, Leased or Marketed,” or ASC 350-40, “Internal-Use Software.” Costs associated with the planning and designing phase of software development are classified as research and development costs and are expensed as incurred. The amounts capitalized include external direct costs of services used in developing internal-use software, employee compensation and related expenses of personnel directly associated with the development activities. Once technological feasibility has been determined, a portion of the costs incurred in development, including coding, testing and quality assurance, are capitalized until available for general release to clients.

Amortization is calculated on a solution-by-solution basis and is recognized over the estimated economic life of the software, typically ranging two to three years. Amortization begins when the software is substantially completed for its intended use. Costs incurred during the preliminary and post-implementation stages are expensed as incurred. The amounts capitalized include external direct costs of services used in developing internal-use software, employee compensation and related expenses of personnel directly associated with the development activities. Software development costs are evaluated for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. Unrecoverable costs are reviewed annually and recognized in the period they become unrecoverable, as needed, and are recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Operations as depreciation and amortization expense.
The unamortized software development costs and amortization expense were as follows:
Year ended December 31,
2020 2019 2018
Unamortized software development costs $ 28,512 $ 22,240 $ 17,490
Software development amortization expense 10,843 8,258 8,123
The Company recognized impairment charges to its capitalized software intangible assets, of $0.9 million, nil and $0.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The Company includes these impairments within the depreciation and amortization in its Consolidated Statements of Operations.
Concentration of Credit Risk
The Company’s financial instruments that are exposed to concentration of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivable. The Company maintains its cash and cash equivalents at several major financial institutions. The Company believes that concentration of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable is limited because of the creditworthiness of its major customers.
The Company’s top five customers accounted for 68.0%, 69.2% and 69.0% of net revenues for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Contracts with these customers typically run for three to five years. Of these customers, Verizon accounted for more than 10% of the Company’s revenues in 2020, 2019, and 2018.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less at the date of acquisition to be cash equivalents.
Accounts Receivable
Accounts receivable include current notes, amounts billed to customers, claims, and unbilled revenue, which consists of amounts recognized as sales but not yet billed. Substantially all amounts of unbilled receivables are expected to be billed and collected in the subsequent year. The Company had unbilled receivable balances of $3.4 million and $5.1 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Allowance for Credit Losses
The Company is exposed to credit losses primarily through sales of products and services. The Company’s expected loss allowance methodology for accounts receivable is developed using historical collection experience, current and future economic and market conditions and a review of the current status of customers' trade accounts receivables. Customers are pooled based on sharing specific risk factors, including geographic location. Due to the short-term nature of such receivables, the estimated accounts receivable that may not be collected is based on aging of the accounts receivable balances.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Amounts in tables in thousands, except for per share data or unless otherwise noted)
Customers are assessed for credit worthiness upfront through a credit review, which includes assessment based on our analysis of their financial statements when a credit rating is not available. The Company evaluates contract terms and conditions, country and political risk, and may require prepayment to mitigate risk of loss. Specific allowance amounts are established to record the appropriate provision for customers that have a higher probability of default. The Company monitors changes to the receivables balance on timely basis, and balances are written off as they are determined to be uncollectible after all collection efforts have been exhausted. Estimates of potential credit losses are used to determine the allowance. It is based on assessment of anticipated payment and all other historical, current and future information that is reasonably available.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments and Liabilities
The Company includes disclosures of fair value information about financial instruments and liabilities, whether or not recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, for which it is practicable to estimate that value. Due to their short-term nature, the carrying amounts reported in the financial statements approximate the fair value for cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, accounts receivable and accounts payable.
Property and Equipment
Property and equipment and leasehold improvements are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which range from 3 to 5 years, or the lesser of the related initial term of the lease or useful life for leasehold improvements. Amortization of property and equipment recorded under a capital lease is included with depreciation expense. Expenditures for routine maintenance and repairs are charged against operations, while major replacements, improvements and additions are capitalized.
Noncontrolling Interests and Mandatorily Redeemable Financial Instruments
Noncontrolling interests (“NCI”) are evaluated by the Company and are shown as either a liability, temporary equity (shown between liabilities and equity) or as permanent equity depending on the nature of the redeemable features at amounts based on formulas specific to each entity. Generally, mandatorily redeemable NCIs are classified as liabilities and non-mandatorily redeemable NCIs are classified outside of stockholders’ equity in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as temporary equity under the caption, redeemable noncontrolling interests, and are measured at their redemption values at the end of each period. If the redemption value is greater than the carrying value, an adjustment is recorded in retained earnings to record the NCI at its redemption value. Redeemable NCIs that are mandatorily redeemable are classified as a liability in the Consolidated Balance Sheets under either other current liabilities or other long-term liabilities, depending on the remaining duration until settlement, and are measured at the amount of cash that would be paid if settlement occurred at the balance sheet date with any change from the prior period recognized as interest expense.
If the noncontrolling interest is not currently redeemable yet probable of becoming redeemable, the Company is required to either (1) accrete changes in the redemption value over the period from the date of issuance to the earliest redemption date of the instrument using an appropriate methodology, usually the interest method, or (2) recognize changes in the redemption value immediately as they occur and adjust the carrying value of the security to equal the redemption value at the end of each reporting period. The Company has elected to recognize changes in the redemption value immediately as they occur and adjust the carrying value of the noncontrolling interest to the greater of the estimated redemption value, which approximates fair value, at the end of each reporting period or the initial carrying amount.
Net income attributable to NCIs reflects the portion of the net income (loss) of consolidated entities applicable to the NCI stockholders in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations. The net income attributable to NCI is classified in the Consolidated Statements of Operations as part of consolidated net income and deducted from total consolidated net income to arrive at the net income attributable to the Company.
Business Combinations
The Company accounts for business combinations in accordance with the acquisition method. The acquisition method of accounting requires that assets acquired, liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree (if any), be recorded
Table of Content
SYNCHRONOSS TECHNOLOGIES, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Amounts in tables in thousands, except for per share data or unless otherwise noted)
at their fair values on the date of a business acquisition. The Company’s consolidated financial statements and results of operations reflect an acquired business from the completion date of the transaction.
The judgments that the Company makes in determining the estimated fair value assigned to each class of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, as well as asset lives, can materially impact net income in periods following a business combination. The Company generally uses either the income, cost or market approach to aid in its conclusions of such fair values and asset lives. The income approach presumes that the value of an asset can be estimated by the net economic benefit to be received over the life of the asset, discounted to present value. The cost approach presumes that an investor would pay no more for an asset than its replacement or reproduction cost. The market approach estimates value based on what other participants in the market have paid for reasonably similar assets. Although each valuation approach is considered in valuing the assets acquired, the approach ultimately selected is based on the characteristics of the asset and the availability of information.
The Company records contingent consideration resulting from a business combination at its fair value on the acquisition date. Each reporting period thereafter, the Company revalues these obligations and records increases or decreases in their fair value as an adjustment to net change in contingent consideration obligation within the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration obligation can result from updates in the achievement of financial or other operational targets and changes to the weighted probability of achieving those future targets. Significant judgment is employed in determining the appropriateness of these assumptions as of the acquisition date and for each subsequent period. Accordingly, any change in the assumptions described above, could have a material impact on the amount of the net change in contingent consideration obligation that the Company records in any given period.
Discontinued Operations
The Company generally classifies a disposal transaction as discontinued operation in the consolidated financial statements when it qualifies as a component of the Company, meets the held for sale criteria, is disposed of by sale, or is disposed of other than by sale and it represents a strategic shift that has a major effect on the Company’s operations and financial results. Insignificant and non-strategic shifting divestitures are not classified within discontinued operations.
Investments in Affiliates and Other Entities
In the normal course of business, Synchronoss enters into various types of investment arrangements, each having unique terms and conditions. These investments may include equity interests held by Synchronoss in business entities, including general or limited partnerships, contractual ventures, or other forms of equity participation. Synchronoss determines whether such investments involve a variable interest entity (“VIE”) based on the characteristics of the subject entity. If the entity is determined to be a VIE, then management determines if Synchronoss is the primary beneficiary of the entity and whether or not consolidation of the VIE is required. The primary beneficiary consolidating the VIE must normally have both (i) the power to direct the activities of a VIE that most significantly affect the VIE’s economic performance and (ii) the obligation to absorb losses of the VIE or the right to receive benefits from the VIE, in either case that could potentially be significant to the VIE. When Synchronoss is deemed to be the primary beneficiary, the VIE is consolidated and the other party’s equity interest in the VIE is accounted for as a noncontrolling interest.
The Company generally accounts for investments it makes in VIEs in which it has determined that it does not have a controlling financial interest but has significant influence over and holds at least a 20% ownership interest using the equity method. Any such investment not meeting the parameters to be accounted under the equity method would be accounted for using the cost method unless the investment had a readily determinable fair value, at which it would then be reported.
If an entity fails to meet the characteristics of a VIE, the Company then evaluates such entity under the voting model. Under the voting model, the Company consolidates the entity if they determine that they, directly or indirectly, have greater than 50% of the voting shares, and determine that other equity holders do not have substantive participating rights.
Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of assets acquired, including other definite-lived intangible assets. Goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or when an interim triggering event has

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Amounts in tables in thousands, except for per share data or unless otherwise noted)
occurred indicating potential impairment. The Company has concluded that it has two operating segments and one reportable segment because the aggregation criteria and the quantitative threshold test was met. The Company tests for goodwill impairment on each of its reporting units, which is at the operating segment or one level below the operating segment.
During the Company’s qualitative assessment, the Company makes significant estimates, assumptions, and judgments, around the financial performance of the Company, changes in share price, and forecasts of earnings, working capital requirements, and cash flows. The Company considers each reporting unit's historical results and operating trends as well as any strategic difference from the Company’s historical results when determining these assumptions.
The Company can opt to perform a qualitative assessment to test a reporting unit’s goodwill for impairment or the Company can directly perform the quantitative impairment test. If the Company determines that the fair value of a reporting unit is more likely than not to be less than its carrying amount, a quantitative impairment test is performed.
Fair value estimates used in the quantitative impairment test are calculated using a combination of the income and market approaches. The income approach is based on the present value of future cash flows of each reporting unit, while the market approach is based on certain multiples of selected guideline public companies or selected guideline transactions. The approaches incorporate a number of market participant assumptions including future growth rates, discount rates, income tax rates and market activity in assessing fair value and are reporting unit specific. If the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit's fair value, the Company recognizes an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit's fair value.
The fair value measurement associated with the quantitative goodwill impairment test is based on significant inputs that are not observable in the market and thus represents a Level 3 measurement. Significant changes in the underlying assumptions used to value goodwill could significantly increase or decrease the fair value estimates used for impairment assessments.
In order to assess the reasonableness of the estimated fair value of the Company’s reporting units, the Company compares the aggregate reporting unit fair value to the Company’s market capitalization on an overall basis and calculates an implied control premium (the excess of the sum of the reporting units’ fair value over the Company’s market capitalization on an overall basis). The Company evaluates the control premium by comparing it to observable control premiums from recent comparable transactions. If the implied control premium is determined to not be reasonable in light of these recent transactions, the Company re-evaluates its reporting unit fair values, which may result in an adjustment to the discount rate and/or other assumptions.
This re-evaluation could result in a change to the estimated fair value for certain or all reporting units. If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds the carrying amount of the net assets assigned to that reporting unit, goodwill is not impaired.
If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, goodwill is impaired and the excess of the reporting unit’s carrying value over the fair value is recognized as an impairment loss.
The Company recorded a nil, nil and $9.1 million impairment charge on the Zentry joint venture for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. For further details, see Note 9. Goodwill and Intangibles.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
A review of long-lived assets for impairment is performed when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable. If an indication of impairment is present, the Company compares the estimated undiscounted future cash flows to be generated by the asset to the asset’s carrying amount. If the undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset, the Company records an impairment loss equal to the amount by which the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its fair value. The fair value is determined based on valuation techniques such as a comparison to fair values of similar assets or using a discounted cash flow analysis.
This fair value measurement is based on significant inputs that are not observable in the market and thus represents a Level 3 measurement. Significant changes in the underlying assumptions used to value long lived assets could significantly increase or decrease the fair value estimates used for impairment assessments.
Table of Content

(Amounts in tables in thousands, except for per share data or unless otherwise noted)
Long lived assets that do not have indefinite lives are amortized/depreciated over their useful lives and reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. The Company reevaluates the useful life determinations each year to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining useful lives.
Leases
The Company adopted Accounting Standards Codification Topic 842, Leases (ASC 842) on January 1, 2019. ASC 842 applies to a number of arrangements to which the Company is party whereby the Company acts as a lessee.
Whenever the Company enters into a new arrangement, it must determine, at the inception date, whether the arrangement contains a lease. This determination generally depends on whether the arrangement conveys to the Company the right to control the use of an explicitly or implicitly identified fixed asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. Control of an underlying asset is conveyed to the Company if the Company obtains the rights to direct the use of and to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from using the underlying asset.
If a lease exists, the Company must then determine the separate lease and non-lease components of the arrangement. Each right to use an underlying asset conveyed by a lease arrangement should generally be considered a separate lease component if it both: (i) can benefit the Company without depending on other resources not readily available to the Company and (ii) does not significantly affect and is not significantly affected by other rights of use conveyed by the lease. Aspects of a lease arrangement that transfer other goods or services to the Company but do not meet the definition of lease components are considered non-lease components. The consideration owed by the Company pursuant to a lease arrangement is generally allocated to each lease and non-lease component for accounting purposes. However, the Company has elected to not separate lease and non-lease components. Each lease component is accounted for separately from other lease components, but together with the associated non-lease components.
For each lease, the Company must then determine:
•The lease term - The lease term is the period of the lease not cancellable by the Company, together with periods covered by: (i) renewal options the Company is reasonably certain to exercise or that are controlled by the lessor and (ii) termination options the Company is reasonably certain not to exercise.
•The present value of lease payments is calculated based on:
-Lease payments - Lease payments include certain fixed and variable payments, less lease incentives, together with amounts probable of being owed by the Company under residual value guarantees and, if reasonably certain of being paid, the cost of certain renewal options and early termination penalties set forth in the lease arrangement. Lease payments exclude consideration that is: (i) not related to the transfer of goods and services to the Company and (ii) allocated to the non-lease components in a lease arrangement, except for the classes of assets where the Company has elected to not separate lease and non-lease components.
-Discount rate - The discount rate must be determined based on information available to the Company upon the commencement of a lease. Lessees are required to use the rate implicit in the lease whenever such rate is readily available; however, as the implicit rate in the Company's leases is generally not readily determinable, the Company generally uses the hypothetical incremental borrowing rate it would have to pay to borrow an amount equal to the lease payments, on a collateralized basis, over a timeframe similar to the lease term.
•Lease classification - In making the determination of whether a lease is an operating lease or a finance lease, the Company considers the lease term in relation to the economic life of the leased asset, the present value of lease payments in relation to the fair value of the leased asset and certain other factors, including the lessee's and lessor's rights, obligations and economic incentives over the term of the lease.
Table of Content
SYNCHRONOSS TECHNOLOGIES, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Amounts in tables in thousands, except for per share data or unless otherwise noted)
Generally, upon the commencement of a lease, the Company will record a lease liability and a right-of-use (ROU) asset. However, the Company has elected, for certain classes of underlying assets with initial lease terms of twelve months or less (known as short-term leases), to not recognize a lease liability or ROU asset. Lease liabilities are initially recorded at lease commencement as the present value of future lease payments. ROU assets are initially recorded at lease commencement as the initial amount of the lease liability, together with the following, if applicable: (i) initial direct costs and (ii) lease payments made, net of lease incentives received, prior to lease commencement.
Over the lease term, the Company generally increases it lease liabilities using the effective interest method and decreases its lease liabilities for lease payments made. The Company generally amortizes its ROU assets over the shorter of the estimated useful life and the lease term and assesses its ROU assets for impairment, similar to other long-lived assets.
For finance leases, amortization expense and interest expense are recognized separately in the Consolidated Statements of Operations, with amortization expense generally recorded on a straight-line basis and interest expense recorded using the effective interest method. For operating leases, a single lease cost is generally recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Lease costs for short-term leases not recognized in the Consolidated Balance Sheets are recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and are expensed as incurred. Variable lease costs not initially included in the lease liability and ROU asset impairment charges are expensed as incurred.
Income Taxes
On December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted TCJA. The TCJA makes changes to the corporate tax rate, business-related deductions and taxation of foreign earnings, among others, that will generally be effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017. While our accounting for the recorded impact of the TCJA is deemed to be complete as of December 31, 2020, these amounts are based on prevailing regulations and currently available information, and any additional guidance issued by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) could impact our recorded amounts in future periods.
Since we conduct operations on a global basis, our effective tax rate has and will depend upon the geographic distribution of our pre-tax earnings among locations with varying tax rates. We account for the effects of income taxes that result from our activities during the current and preceding years. Under this method, deferred income tax liabilities and assets are based on the difference between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect in the years in which the differences are expected to reverse or be utilized. The realization of deferred tax assets is contingent upon the generation of future taxable income. A valuation allowance is recorded if it is “more likely than not” that a portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized.
In evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets within the jurisdiction from which they arise, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax-planning strategies, and results of recent operations. In projecting future taxable income, we begin with historical results and incorporate assumptions including the amount of future state, federal and foreign pretax operating income, the reversal of temporary differences, and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax-planning strategies. These assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses.
We recognize a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination based on the technical merits of the position. The amount of the accrual for which an exposure exists is measured by determining the amount that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon the settlement of the position. Components of the reserve are classified as current or a long-term liability in the Consolidated Balance Sheets based on when we expect each of the items to be settled. We record interest and penalties accrued in relation to uncertain tax benefits as a component of interest expense.
While we believe we have identified all reasonably identifiable exposures and that the reserve we have established for identifiable exposures is appropriate under the circumstances, it is possible that additional exposures exist and that exposures may be settled at amounts different than the amounts reserved. It is also possible that changes in facts and circumstances could cause us to either materially increase or reduce the carrying amount of our tax reserves. In general, tax returns for the year 2016 and thereafter are subject to future examination by tax authorities.

(Amounts in tables in thousands, except for per share data or unless otherwise noted)
Our policy has been to leave our cumulative unremitted foreign earnings invested indefinitely outside the United States, and we intend to continue this policy. Although the transition tax in the TCJA has removed U.S. federal taxes on distributions to the U.S. on a go forward basis, the Company continues to assert permanent reinvestment of foreign earnings. Due to the timing and circumstances of repatriation of such earnings, if any, it is not practicable to determine the unrecognized deferred tax liability relating to such amounts.
Foreign Currency
The functional currency of non-U.S. entities is translated into U.S. dollars for balance sheet accounts using the month end rates in effect as of the balance sheet date and average exchange rate for revenue and expense accounts for each respective period. The translation adjustments are deferred as a separate component of stockholders’ equity within accumulated other comprehensive income.
Gains or losses resulting from transactions denominated in foreign currencies are included in other income or expense, within the Consolidated Statements of Operations and were as follows:
Twelve Months Ended December 31,
2020 2019 2018
Net gain (loss) on foreign currency translations $ 4,234 $ 31 $ (478)
Comprehensive Income (Loss)
Reporting on comprehensive income requires components of other comprehensive income, including unrealized gains or losses on available-for-sale securities, to be included as part of total comprehensive income. Comprehensive income is comprised of net income, translation adjustments and unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities. The components of comprehensive income are included in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss).
Basic and Diluted Net Income Attributable to Common Stockholders per Common Share
Basic EPS is computed based upon the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the year, excluding amounts associated with restricted shares.
Diluted EPS is computed based upon the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the year plus the potential dilutive effect of common stock equivalents using the treasury stock method and the average market price of the Company’s common stock for the year. The potential dilutive effect of common stock includes stock options, convertible debt and unvested restricted stock. The dilutive effects of stock options and restricted stock awards are based on the treasury stock method. The dilutive effect of the assumed conversion of convertible debt is determined using the if-converted method. The after-tax effect of interest expense related to the convertible securities is added back to net income, and the convertible debt is assumed to have been converted into common shares at the beginning of the period.
The Company includes participating securities (Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock - Participation with Dividends on Common Stock that contain preferred dividend) in the computation of EPS pursuant to the two-class method. The two-class method of computing earnings per share is an allocation method that calculates earnings per share for common stock and participating securities. During periods of net loss, no effect is given to the participating securities because they do not share in the losses of the Company.
Stock-Based Compensation
As of December 31, 2020, the Company maintains eight stock-based compensation plans.
Table of Content
SYNCHRONOSS TECHNOLOGIES, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Amounts in tables in thousands, except for per share data or unless otherwise noted)
The Company utilizes the Black-Scholes pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options on the dates of grant. Restricted stock awards are measured based on the fair market values of the underlying stock on the dates of grant. The Company recognizes stock-based compensation over the requisite service period with an offsetting credit to additional paid-in capital.
For the Company’s performance restricted stock awards, the Company estimates the number of shares the recipient is to receive by applying a probability of achieving the performance goals. The actual number of shares the recipient receives is determined at the end of the performance period based on the results achieved versus goals based on the performance targets, such as revenues and earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”) after certain adjustments. Once the number of awards is determined, the compensation cost is fixed and continues to be recognized using straight line recognition over the requisite service period for each vesting tranche.
Use of a valuation model requires management to make certain assumptions with respect to selected model inputs. Expected volatility was calculated based on historical information of the Company’s stock. The average expected life was determined using historical stock option exercise activity. The risk-free interest rate is based on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with a remaining term equal to the expected life assumed at the date of grant. The Company has never declared or paid cash dividends on the common or preferred equity and does not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Forfeitures are accounted for as they occur.
Segment and Geographic Information
The Company’s chief operating decision-maker is the Principal Executive Officer, who reviews financial information presented on a consolidated basis for purposes of making operating decisions. However, in assessing financial performance and allocating resources, the Company considers the markets in which it operates. The Company has determined that it currently operates in two business segments: (i) providing cloud solutions and software-based activation for connected devices globally and (ii) enterprise solutions. Given the size of the Company’s enterprise segment, and the Company’s shift in focus toward the telecommunications, media and technology (“TMT”) market, the Company concluded that it has one reportable segment. Although the Company operates in North America, Europe and Asia-Pacific a majority of the Company’s revenue and long-lived assets are in the U.S.
Revenues by geography are based on the billing addresses of the Company’s customers. The following tables set forth revenues and property and equipment, net by geographic area:

* In 2019, changes to the STIN business led the Company to conclude that its collection of certain STIN receivables is no longer probable. The Company has updated its collectability assessment in accordance with ASC 842 and concluded that a contingency reserve is required, which included a reduction of digital revenue in America in the amount $26.0 million. For further details, see 7. Investments in Affiliates and Related Transactions of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-K.
Trade Accounts Receivable and Contract balances
The Company classifies its right to consideration in exchange for deliverables as either a receivable or a contract asset. A receivable is a right to consideration that is unconditional (i.e. only the passage of time is required before payment is due). For example, the Company recognizes a receivable for revenues related to its time and materials and transaction or volume-based contracts. The Company presents such receivables in Trade accounts receivable, net in its consolidated statements of financial position at their net estimated realizable value. The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts to provide for the estimated amount of receivables that may not be collected. The allowance is based upon an assessment of customer creditworthiness, historical payment experience, the age of outstanding receivables and other applicable factors.
A contract asset is a right to consideration that is conditional upon factors other than the passage of time. For example, the Company would record a contract asset if its records revenue on a professional services engagement but are not entitled to bill until the Company achieves specified milestones. Contract asset balance at December 31, 2020 is $7.1 million.
Amounts collected in advance of services being provided are accounted for as contract liabilities, which are presented as deferred revenue on the accompanying balance sheet and are realized with the associated revenue recognized under the contract. Nearly all of the Company's contract liabilities balance is related to services revenue, primarily subscription services contracts.
The Company’s contract assets and liabilities are reported in a net position on a customer basis at the end of each reporting period.

Contract acquisition costs
In connection with the adoption of Topic 606 and the related cost accounting guidance under Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 340, the Company is required to capitalize certain contract acquisition costs consisting primarily of commissions and bonuses paid when contracts are signed. The Company adopted Topic 606 on January 1, 2018 and capitalized $0.7 million in contract acquisition costs related to contracts that were not completed. For contracts that have a duration of less than one year, the Company follows a Topic 606 practical expedient and expenses these costs over the estimated customer life, because it does not pay commissions upon renewals that are commensurate with the initial contract. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the amount of amortization was $0.2 million and there was no impairment loss in relation to costs capitalized.
Contract Fulfillment Costs
Under ASC 340-40, the Company evaluates whether or not it should capitalize the costs of fulfilling a contract. Such costs would be capitalized when they are not within the scope of other standards and: (1) are directly related to a contract; (2) generate or enhance resources that will be used to satisfy performance obligations; and (3) are expected to be recovered. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had $0.1 million of capitalized contract fulfillment costs.
Transaction price allocated to the remaining performance obligations
Topic 606 requires that the Company disclose the aggregate amount of transaction price that is allocated to performance obligations that have not yet been satisfied as of December 31, 2020. The Company has elected not to disclose transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations for:
1.Contracts with an original duration of one year or less, including contracts that can be terminated for convenience without a substantive penalty;
2.Contracts for which the Company recognizes revenues based on the right to invoice for services performed;
3.Variable consideration allocated entirely to a wholly unsatisfied performance obligation or to a wholly unsatisfied promise to transfer a distinct good or service that forms part of a single performance obligation in accordance with Topic 606 Section 10-25-14(b), for which the criteria in Topic 606 Section 10-32-40 have been met. This applies to a limited number of situations where the Company is dependent upon data from a third party or where fees are highly variable.
Many of the Company’s performance obligations meet one or more of these exemptions. Specifically, the Company has excluded the following from the Company’s remaining performance obligations, all of which will be resolved in the period in which amounts are known:
•consideration for future transactions, above any contractual minimums
•consideration for success-based transactions contingent on third-party data
•credits for failure to meet future service level requirements

(Amounts in tables in thousands, except for per share data or unless otherwise noted)
As of December 31, 2020, the aggregate amount of transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations, other than those meeting the exclusion criteria above, was $280.4 million, of which approximately 70.19% is expected to be recognized as revenues within 2 years, and the remainder thereafter.
Estimates of revenue expected to be recognized in future periods also exclude unexercised customer options to purchase services that do not represent material rights to the customer. Customer options that do not represent a material right are only accounted for in accordance with Topic 606 when the customer exercises its option to purchase additional goods or services.
4. Acquisitions and Divestitures
2018 Transactions
Acquisition
Honeybee
In May 2018, the Company completed the acquisition of the honeybee software business (“honeybee”), a provider of digital solutions targeted at optimizing the customer experience from Dixons Carphone plc which offers a digital transformation platform that makes it easier for companies to design and launch omni-channel customer journeys. Consideration paid by the Company consisted of approximately $9.7 million in cash at the time of closing and deferred consideration of $8.7 million to be paid over the next three years.
Customers of the honeybee platform, such as mobile operators and other communication service providers, can rapidly create and adapt digital sales processes for contact centers, retail stores, and online channels. This helps reduce complexity for the end-user as well as internal employees, while delivering a single customer experience at all touch-points and improved business outcomes such as reduced cost and increased revenue. The acquisition did not have a material impact on the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations.
Acquisition-Related Costs
Total acquisition-related costs recognized during the year ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018 including transaction costs such as legal, accounting, valuation and other professional services, were nil, nil, $0.1 million, respectively, and are included in selling, general and administrative expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.
Divestitures
SNCR, LLC
On November 16, 2015, the Company formed a venture with Goldman Sachs (“Goldman”), referred to as SNCR, LLC in order to develop and deploy the Synchronoss Secure Mobility Suite, which would include integration of Synchronoss Workspace platform with Goldman's internally developed mobile security intellectual property to help provide a safe, secure mobile device environment that also effectively supports bring your own device (“BYOD”).
During the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company entered into a termination agreement with Goldman to terminate the venture, and provide a perpetual, irrevocable license of the venture’s intellectual property for use in Goldman’s back-office. As part of the agreement, the Company was relieved of any future obligations to support Goldman’s use of the software. The venture formally ended in the first quarter of 2018 resulting in the elimination of the Company’s associated noncontrolling interest balance and an increase to additional paid in capital balance of $12.8 million on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet.

5. Allowance for Credit Losses
Effective January 1, 2020, the Company adopted ASU 2016-13, “Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments,” prospectively. ASU 2016-13 replaces the incurred loss impairment model with an expected credit loss impairment model for financial instruments, including trade receivables. The guidance requires entities to consider forward-looking information to estimate expected credit losses, resulting in earlier recognition of losses for receivables that are current or not yet due. Upon adoption, changes in the allowance were not material for the transition period starting January 1, 2020 through the year ended December 31, 2020.
The accounts receivable balance on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2020 was $47.8 million, net of $0.5 million of allowances. Changes in the allowance were not material for the year ended December 31, 2020. The following table provides a roll-forward of the allowance for credit losses that is deducted from the amortized cost basis of accounts receivable to present the net amount expected to be collected (amounts in thousands):
Balance at December 31, 2019 $ 1,864
Adjustment due to adoption of ASU 2016-13 751
Balance at January 1, 2020 2,615
Current period change for expected credit losses (2,072)
Balance at December 31, 2020 $ 543
In connection with the PIK note referenced in Note 7. Investments in Affiliates and Related Transactions , the company recorded a CECL adjustment of $1.4 million which offset the current year accretion of the interest of $1.4 million.
6. Fair Value Measurements
In accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. A three-level hierarchy prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value as follows:
•Level 1 - Observable inputs - quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities;
•Level 2 - Observable inputs other than the quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities includes quoted prices for similar instruments, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in inactive markets, and amounts derived from valuation models where all significant inputs are observable in active markets; and
•Level 3 - Unobservable inputs - includes amounts derived from valuation models where one or more significant inputs are unobservable and require the Company to develop relevant assumptions.

Marketable Securities
The Company utilizes the market approach to measure fair value for its financial assets. The market approach uses prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets. The Company’s marketable securities investments classified as Level 2 primarily utilize broker quotes in a non-active market for valuation of these securities. No transfers of assets between Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3 of the fair value measurement hierarchy occurred during the year ended December 31, 2020.
For marketable debt securities, unrealized gains and losses are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders’ equity. The cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method. The Company evaluates investments with unrealized losses to determine if the losses are other than temporary. There were no unrealized losses as of December 31, 2020 and the Company has determined that the gross unrealized losses were temporary as of December 31, 2019. In making this determination, the Company considered the financial condition, credit ratings and near-term prospects of the issuers, the underlying collateral of the investments, and the magnitude of the losses as compared to the cost and the length of time the investments have been in an unrealized loss position.
The marketable equity securities are mutual funds measured at fair value and classified within Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. Unrealized gains and losses related to the Company’s marketable equity securities were recognized in other income (expense), net.
The estimated fair value of investments in marketable debt securities were immaterial at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
At December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, the aggregate related fair value of investment with unrealized losses was approximately nil and nil respectively.
At December 31, 2020, the estimated fair value of investments in marketable equity securities, were as follows:
Balance at December 31, 2019 $ 11
Mutual funds purchases -
Mutual funds sales (11)
Realized gains (losses) -
Balance at December 31, 2020 $ -
Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests
The redeemable noncontrolling interests recorded at fair value are put arrangements held by the noncontrolling interests in certain of the Company’s joint ventures. The Company recognizes changes in the redemption value immediately as they occur and adjusts the carrying value of the noncontrolling interest to the greater of the estimated redemption value, which approximates fair value, at the end of each reporting period or the initial carrying amount.
The fair value of the redeemable noncontrolling interests was estimated by applying an income approach using a discounted cash flow analysis. This fair value measurement is based on significant inputs that are not observable in the market and thus represents a Level 3 measurement. Significant changes in the underlying assumptions used to value the redeemable noncontrolling interests could significantly increase or decrease the fair value estimates recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
The changes in fair value of the Company’s Level 3 redeemable noncontrolling interests during the year ended December 31, 2020 were as follows:
Balance at December 31, 2019 $ 12,500
Fair value adjustment (344)
Net income attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interests 344
Balance at December 31, 2020 $ 12,500

7. Investments in Affiliates and Related Transactions
Sequential Technology International, LLC
In connection with the divestiture of the exception handling business of the Company in 2017, Synchronoss entered into a three-year Cloud Telephony and Support services agreement (“CTS Agreement”) to grant Sequential Technology International, LLC (“STIN”) access to certain Synchronoss software and private branch exchange systems to facilitate exception handling operations required to support STIN customers.
The CTS agreement expired in the first quarter of 2020. At the time of the expiration, the Company entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement with STIN. As part of the agreement, the Company received $1.6 million in exchange for certain hardware and system assets for the cloud telephony and remaining support service business.
During the second quarter of 2020, the Company entered into an agreement with STIN and AP Capital Holdings II, LLC (“APC”) to divest its remaining equity interest in STIN as well as settle its paid-in-kind purchase money note (“PIK note”) and certain amounts due as of December 31, 2019 in consideration for a $9.0 million secured promissory note (the “Note”), which includes contingent consideration of up to $16.0 million. The Note has an 8% interest rate and a 3-year stated term. As part of the arrangement, APC acquired a majority stake of STIN. Additionally, in the event of a Sale of STIN by APC and STIN at a future date, the Company shall receive 5% of such sale proceeds, after reducing the sale proceeds by any outstanding amounts of the above Note, including any earned contingent consideration. The Company determined the fair value of the Note as of the transaction date to be approximately $4.8 million. The Company determined the fair value of the Note using a discounted cash flow analysis, which discounts the expected future cash flows of the asset to determine its fair value. The fair value measurement is based on significant inputs not observable in the market and thus represents a Level 3 measurement. The Note has been reflected in Loan Receivable on the Consolidated balance sheet. No gain or loss was recognized as a result of the transaction. As of December 31, 2020, the Company reassessed the fair value of the note and there were no material changes.
For the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company recognized nil and $(6.9) million, respectively, in revenue related to Cloud Telephony and Support services, and nil and nil, respectively, in revenue related to all other services.
In 2019, changes to the STIN business led the Company to conclude that its collection of certain STIN receivables was no longer probable. In accordance with ASC 842, the portion of revenue that is no longer deemed collectible is reversed in the current period against revenue. Accordingly, the Company determined a contingency reserve was required, which included a reduction of revenue in the amount $26.0 million in the third quarter of 2019. The impacts of this change are reflected in the STIN affiliate revenue and accounts receivable.
The STIN affiliate accounts receivable balances in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, were nil and $8.1 million, respectively. These amounts principally included revenues generated from the Cloud and Telephony Support Services agreement and pass-through of vendor expenses incurred during the transition and assignment of vendor contracts.

Depreciation expense was approximately $15.6 million, $43.5 million and $55.8 million for 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. Amortization of property and equipment recorded under capital leases are included in depreciation expense.
9. Goodwill and Intangibles
Goodwill
The Company records goodwill which represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of assets acquired, including other definite-lived intangible assets. Goodwill is reviewed annually for impairment or upon the occurrence of events or changes in circumstances that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount.
The following table shows the adjustments to goodwill during 2020 and 2019:
Balance at December 31, 2018 $ 224,899
Translation adjustments (1,930)
Balance at December 31, 2019 $ 222,969
Translation adjustments 9,802
Balance at December 31, 2020 $ 232,771
When performing its annual impairment test, the Company compares the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying amount with the fair values derived from the market approach the income approach. Under the market approach, the Company estimates fair value based on market multiples of revenue and earnings derived from comparable publicly-traded companies with similar operating and investment characteristics as the reporting unit. The Company weights the fair value derived from the market approach depending on the level of comparability of these publicly-traded companies to the reporting unit. When market comparables are not meaningful or not available, the Company estimates the fair value of a reporting unit using only the income approach. Under the income approach, the Company estimates the fair value of a reporting unit based on the present value of estimated future cash flows. The Company bases cash flow projections on management’s estimates of revenue growth rates and operating margins, taking into consideration industry and market conditions. The Company bases the discount rate on the weighted-average cost of capital adjusted for the relevant risk associated with business-specific characteristics and the uncertainty related to the reporting unit’s ability to execute on the projected cash flows.
In order to assess the reasonableness of the estimated fair value of the Company’s reporting units, the Company compares the aggregate reporting unit fair value to the Company’s market capitalization on an overall basis and calculates an implied control premium (the excess of the sum of the reporting units’ fair value over the Company’s market capitalization on an
Table of Content
SYNCHRONOSS TECHNOLOGIES, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Amounts in tables in thousands, except for per share data or unless otherwise noted)
overall basis). The Company evaluates the control premium by comparing it to observable control premiums from recent comparable transactions. If the implied control premium is determined to not be reasonable in light of these recent transactions, the Company re-evaluates its reporting unit fair values, which may result in an adjustment to the discount rate and/or other assumptions. This re-evaluation could result in a change to the estimated fair value for certain or all reporting units. If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds the carrying amount of the net assets assigned to that reporting unit, goodwill is not impaired.
If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, goodwill is impaired and the excess of the reporting unit’s carrying value over the fair value is recognized as an impairment loss.
For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018 the Company recognized goodwill impairment charges of nil, nil, and $9.1 million, respectively. The Company recorded a $9.1 million impairment charge on the Zentry joint venture in 2018 as a result of various business changes to Zentry, which ultimately led the Company to sunset certain Zentry product offerings. The Company evaluated the impact of these business changes and determined that the future cash flows generated by the assets were not sufficient to support its recoverability and accordingly, the Company recognized an impairment charge for Zentry’s outstanding goodwill.
Other Intangible Assets
The Company’s intangible assets with definite lives consist primarily of technology, capitalized software, trade names, and customer lists and relationships. These intangible assets are being amortized on the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Amortization expense related to intangible assets for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 was $27.0 million, $33.5 million and $41.3 million, respectively.
The Company recognized impairment charges to its intangible assets of $0.9 million, nil and $11.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 respectively. The Company includes these impairments within depreciation and amortization in its Consolidated Statements of Operations. The 2018 impairment charge was incurred to the outstanding Zentry intangible assets for the same reasons discussed above.

12. Debt
2019 Revolving Credit Facility
On October 4, 2019, the Company entered into a Credit Agreement with Citizens Bank, N.A., for a $10.0 million Revolving Credit Facility. Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at a rate equal to, at the Company’s option, either (1) the arithmetic average of the LIBOR rate determined by reference to the costs of funds for U.S. dollar deposits for the interest period (one, three or six months (or 12 months if agreed to by all applicable Lenders)) as selected by the Company relevant to such borrowing plus the applicable margin, or (2) a base rate determined by reference to the greatest of the federal funds rate plus 0.50%, the prime commercial lending rate as determined by the Agent, and the daily LIBOR rate plus 1.00%, in each case plus an applicable margin and subject to a floor of 0.00%. In addition, on a quarterly basis, the Company is required to pay each lender under the Revolving Credit Facility a 0.2% commitment fee in respect of commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility, which may be subject to adjustment based on the Company’s total leverage ratio. The outstanding balance under the Revolving Credit Facility as of December 31, 2020 is $10.0 million.
Convertible Senior Notes
On August 12, 2014, the Company issued $230.0 million aggregate principal amount of its 0.75% Convertible Senior Notes due in 2019 (the “2019 Notes”). The 2019 Notes were paid at maturity on August 15, 2019. The 2019 Notes bore an interest rate of 0.75% per annum payable semi-annually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year. The Company accounted for the $230.0 million face value of the debt as a liability and capitalized approximately $7.1 million of financing fees, related to the issuance.
During the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, interest expense was $0.2 million, $0.4 million, and $1.6 million respectively.

Preferred Stock
The Board of Directors is authorized to issue preferred shares and has the discretion to determine the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions, including voting rights, dividend rights, conversion rights, redemption privileges and liquidation preferences of preferred stock.
In accordance with the terms of the Share Purchase Agreement dated as of October 17, 2017 (the “PIPE Purchase Agreement”), with Silver Private Holdings I, LLC, an affiliate of Siris (“Silver”), on February 15, 2018, the Company issued to Silver 185,000 shares of its newly issued Series A Convertible Participating Perpetual Preferred Stock (the “Series A Preferred Stock”), par value $0.0001 per share, with an initial liquidation preference of $1,000 per share, in exchange for $97.7 million in cash and the transfer from Silver to the Company of the 5,994,667 shares of the Company’s common stock held by Silver (the “Preferred Transaction”).
As of December 31, 2020, there were 250,432 shares of Series A Preferred Stock outstanding, including the initial issuance of 185,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock and the issuance of 65,432 shares of Series A Preferred Stock as dividends.
In accordance with the terms of the PIPE Purchase Agreement with Silver on February 15, 2018, Silver exercised its option to complete the Preferred Transaction. In connection with the issuance of the Series A Preferred Stock, the Company (i) filed the certificate of designations to its certificate of incorporation to establish the rights, preferences, privileges, qualifications, restrictions and limitations of the Series A Preferred Stock (the “Series A Certificate”) and (ii) entered into the Investor Rights Agreement setting forth certain registration, governance and preemptive rights of Silver with respect to Synchronoss. Pursuant to the PIPE Purchase Agreement, at the closing, the Company paid to Siris $5.0 million as a reimbursement of Silver’s reasonable costs and expenses incurred in connection with the Preferred Transaction. In connection with execution of the Preferred Transaction, Silver delivered 5,994,667 shares of Synchronoss common stock, which have been recorded as Treasury shares as of December 31, 2020.
Certificate of Designation of the Series A Preferred Stock
The rights, preferences, privileges, qualifications, restrictions and limitations of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock are set forth in the Series A Certificate. Under the Series A Certificate, the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock are entitled to receive, on each share of Series A Preferred Stock on a quarterly basis, an amount equal to the dividend rate of 14.5% divided by four and multiplied by the then-applicable Liquidation Preference (as defined in the Series A Certificate) per share of Series A Preferred Stock (collectively, the “Preferred Dividends”). The Preferred Dividends are due on January 1, April 1, July 1 and October 1 of each year (each, a “Series A Dividend Payment Date”). The Company may choose to pay the Preferred Dividends in cash or in additional shares of Series A Preferred Stock. In the event the Company does not declare and pay a dividend in-kind or in cash on any Series A Dividend Payment Date, the unpaid amount of the Preferred Dividend will be added to the Liquidation Preference. In addition, the Series A Preferred Stock participates in dividends declared and paid on shares of the Company’s common stock.
Each share of Series A Preferred Stock is convertible, at the option of the holder, into the number of shares of common stock equal to the “Conversion Price” (as that term is defined in the Series A Certificate) multiplied by the then applicable “Conversion Rate” (as that term is defined in the Series A Certificate). Each share of Series A Preferred Stock is initially convertible into 55.5556 shares of common stock, representing an initial “conversion price” of approximately $18.00 per share of common stock. The Conversion Rate is subject to equitable proportionate adjustment in the event of stock splits, recapitalizations and other events set forth in the Series A Certificate.
On and after the fifth anniversary of February 15, 2018, holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock have the right to cause the Company to redeem each share of Series A Preferred Stock for cash in an amount equal to the sum of the current liquidation preference and any accrued dividends. Each share of Series A Preferred Stock is also redeemable at the option of the holder upon the occurrence of a “Fundamental Change” (as that term is defined in the Series A Certificate) at a specified premium (“Liquidation Value”). In addition, the Company is also permitted to redeem all outstanding shares of the Series A Preferred Stock at any time (i) within the first 30 months of the date of issuance for the sum of the then-applicable Liquidation Preference, accrued but unpaid dividends and a make whole amount (known as “Redemption Value”) and (ii) following the 30-month anniversary of the date of issuance for the sum of the then-applicable Liquidation Preference and the accrued but unpaid dividends. As of December 31, 2020, the Liquidation Value and Redemption Value of the Preferred Shares was $243.1 million.

(Amounts in tables in thousands, except for per share data or unless otherwise noted)
The holders of a majority of the Series A Preferred Stock, voting separately as a class, are entitled at each of the Company’s annual meetings of stockholders or at any special meeting called for the purpose of electing directors (or by written consent signed by the holders of a majority of the then-outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock in lieu of such a meeting): (i) to nominate and elect two members of the Company’s Board of Directors for so long as the Preferred Percentage (as defined in the Series A Certificate) is equal to or greater than 10%; and (ii) to nominate and elect one member of the Company’s Board of Directors for so long as the Preferred Percentage is equal to or greater than 5% but less than 10%.
For so long as the holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock have the right to nominate at least one director, the Company is required to obtain the prior approval of Silver prior to taking certain actions, including: (i) certain dividends, repayments and redemptions; (ii) any amendment to the Company’s certificate of incorporation that adversely effects the rights, preferences, privileges or voting powers of the Series A Preferred Stock; (iii) issuances of stock ranking senior or equivalent to shares of Series A Preferred Stock (including additional shares of Series A Preferred Stock) in the priority of payment of dividends or in the distribution of assets upon any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company; (iv) changes in the size of the Company’s Board of Directors; (v) any amendment, alteration, modification or repeal of the charter of the Company’s Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of the Board of Directors and related documents; and (vi) any change in the Company’s principal business or the entry into any line of business outside of the Company’s existing lines of businesses. In addition, in the event that the Company is in EBITDA Non-Compliance (as defined in the Series A Certificate) or the undertaking of certain actions would result in the Company exceeding a specified pro forma leverage ratio, then the prior approval of Silver would be required to incur indebtedness (or alter any debt document) in excess of $10.0 million, enter or consummate any transaction where the fair market value exceeds $5.0 million individually or $10.0 million in the aggregate in a fiscal year or authorize or commit to capital expenditures in excess of $25.0 million in a fiscal year.
Each holder of Series A Preferred Stock has one vote per share on any matter on which holders of Series A Preferred Stock are entitled to vote separately as a class, whether at a meeting or by written consent. The holders of Series A Preferred Stock are permitted to take any action or consent to any action with respect to such rights without a meeting by delivering a consent in writing or electronic transmission of the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock entitled to cast not less than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize, take or consent to such action at a meeting of stockholders. In addition to any vote (or action taken by written consent) of the holders of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock as a separate class provided for in the Series A Certificate or by the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, the holders of shares of the Series A Preferred Stock are entitled to vote with the holders of shares of common stock (and any other class or series that may similarly be entitled to vote on an as-converted basis with the holders of common stock) on all matters submitted to a vote or to the consent of the stockholders of the Company (including the election of directors) as one class.
Under the Series A Certificate, if Silver and certain of its affiliates have elected to effect a conversion of some or all of their shares of Series A Preferred Stock and if the sum, without duplication, of (i) the aggregate number of shares of the Company’s common stock issued to such holders upon such conversion and any shares of the Company’s common stock previously issued to such holders upon conversion of Series A Preferred Stock and then held by such holders, plus (ii) the number of shares of the Company’s common stock underlying shares of Series A Preferred Stock that would be held at such time by such holders (after giving effect to such conversion), would exceed the 19.9% of the issued and outstanding shares of the Company’s voting stock on an as converted basis (the “Conversion Cap”), then such holders would only be entitled to convert such number of shares as would result in the sum of clauses (i) and (ii) (after giving effect to such conversion) being equal to the Conversion Cap (after giving effect to any such limitation on conversion). Any shares of Series A Preferred Stock which a holder has elected to convert but which, by reason of the previous sentence, are not so converted, will be treated as if the holder had not made such election to convert and such shares of Series A Preferred Stock will remain outstanding. Also, under the Series A Certificate, if the sum, without duplication, of (i) the aggregate voting power of the shares previously issued to Silver and certain of its affiliates held by such holders at the record date, plus (ii) the aggregate voting power of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock held by such holders as of such record date, would exceed 19.99% of the total voting power of the Company’s outstanding voting stock at such record date, then, with respect to such shares, Silver and certain of its affiliates are only entitled to cast a number of votes equal to 19.99% of such total voting power. The limitation on conversion and voting ceases to apply upon receipt of the requisite approval of holders of the Company’s common stock under the applicable listing standards.

Investor Rights Agreement
Concurrently with the closing of the Preferred Transaction, Synchronoss and Silver entered into an Investor Rights Agreement. Under the terms of the Investor Rights Agreement, Silver and Synchronoss have agreed that, effective as of the closing of the Preferred Transaction, the Board of Directors of Synchronoss will consist of ten members. From and after the closing of the Preferred Transaction, so long as the holders of Series A Preferred Stock have the right to nominate a member to the Board of Directors pursuant to the Series A Certificate, the Board of Directors of Synchronoss will consist of (i) two directors nominated and elected by the holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock; (ii) four directors who meet the independence criteria set forth in the applicable listing standards (each of whom will be initially agreed upon by Synchronoss and Silver); and (iii) four other directors, two of whom shall satisfy the independence criteria of the applicable listing standards and, as of the closing of the Preferred Transaction, one of whom shall be the individual then serving as chief executive officer of Synchronoss and one of whom shall be the current chairman of the Board of Directors of Synchronoss as of the date of execution of the Investors Rights Agreement. Following the closing of the Preferred Transaction, so long as the holders of Series A Preferred Stock have the right to nominate at least one director to the Board of Directors of Synchronoss pursuant to the Series A Certificate, Silver will have the right to designate two members of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of the Board of Directors.
Pursuant to the terms of the Investor Rights Agreement, neither Silver nor its affiliates may transfer any shares of Series A Preferred Stock subject to certain exceptions (including transfers to affiliates that agree to be bound by the terms of the Investor Rights Agreement).
For so long as Silver has the right to appoint a director to the Board of Directors of Synchronoss, without the prior approval by a majority of directors voting who are not appointed by the holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock, neither Silver nor its affiliates will directly or indirectly purchase or acquire any debt or equity securities of Synchronoss (including equity-linked derivative securities) if such purchase or acquisition would result in Silver’s Standstill Percentage (as defined in the Investor Rights Agreement) being in excess of 30%. However, the foregoing standstill restrictions would not prohibit the purchase of shares pursuant to the PIPE Purchase Agreement or the receipt of shares of Series A Preferred Stock issued as Preferred Dividends pursuant to the Series A Certificate, shares of Common Stock received upon conversion of shares of Series A Preferred Stock or receipt of any shares of Series A Preferred Stock, Common Stock or other securities of the Company otherwise paid as dividends or as an increase of the Liquidation Preference (as defined in the Series A Certificate) or distributions thereon. Silver will also have preemptive rights with respect to issuances of securities of Synchronoss to maintain its ownership percentage.
Under the terms of the Investor Rights Agreement, Silver will be entitled to (i) three demand registrations, with no more than two demand registrations in any single calendar year and provided that each demand registration must include at least 10% of the shares of Common Stock held by Silver, including shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of shares of Series A Preferred Stock and (ii) unlimited piggyback registration rights with respect to primary issuances and all other issuances.

In March 2015, the Company adopted the 2015 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2015 Plan”). The 2015 Plan replaces the Company’s prior 2000 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2000 Plan”) and the 2006 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2006 Plan”) (collectively, the “Plans”). Beginning March 2015, all awards were granted under the 2015 Plan. In addition, any awards that were previously granted under any prior Plans that terminate without issuance of shares, shall be eligible for issuance under the 2015 Plan.
Under the 2015 Plan, the Company may grant to its employees, outside directors and consultants awards in the form of non-qualified stock options, shares of restricted stock, stock units, or stock appreciation rights and performance shares. The Company’s Board of Directors administers the Plan and is responsible for determining the individuals to be granted options or shares, the number of options or shares each individual will receive, the price per share and the exercise period of each option.
On December 15, 2017, the Compensation Committee adopted the 2017 New Hire Equity Incentive Plan (“2017 New Hire Plan”), which is intended to be exempt from the stockholder approval requirements under the “inducement grant exception” provided by the Inducement Rule. The Committee authorized the issuance of up to 1.5 million Common Shares to new hires, with the purpose of promoting the long-term success of the Company and the creation of stockholder value by (a) providing for the attraction and retention of new employees with exceptional qualifications, (b) encouraging new employees to focus on critical long-range objectives, and (c) linking new employees directly to stockholder interests through increased stock ownership. As required by the Inducement Rule, the Company issues a press release promptly upon issuing shares to new employees pursuant to the 2017 New Hire Plan.
There were no significant changes to the Company’s Stock Plans during the year ended December 31, 2020.

The Company’s performance cash awards granted to executives under the Long Term Incentive (“LTI”) Plans have been accounted for as liability awards, due to the Company’s intent and the ability to settle such awards in cash upon vesting and has reflected such awards in accrued expenses. As of December 31, 2020, the liability for such awards is approximately $0.5 million.

The Company’s effective tax rate was approximately (2.1)% for the year ended December 31, 2019, which was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate primarily due to pre-tax losses in jurisdictions where full valuation allowances have been recorded and in zero tax rate jurisdictions and permanent differences associated with U.S. Base Erosion and Anti Abuse Tax elections, offset by certain foreign jurisdictions projecting current income tax expense.

As of December 31, 2020, the Company has federal and state income tax net operating loss (“NOL”) carryforwards of $42.3 million and $116.3 million, respectively, including NOL carryforwards which will expire at various dates from 2023 through 2039, and NOL carryforwards which do not expire. The Company also has foreign NOL carryforwards in various jurisdictions of $112.3 million that have various carryforward periods. Such NOL carryforwards expire as follows:
NOL carryforward
2021 $ 2,040
2022 $ 2,222
2023 - 2038 159,194
Indefinite 107,474
Total $ 270,930
In evaluating the Company’s ability to recover its deferred tax assets within the jurisdiction from which they arise, the Company considers all available positive and negative evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax-planning strategies, and results of recent operations. In projecting future taxable income, the Company begins with historical results and incorporates assumptions including the amount of future state, federal and foreign pretax operating income, the reversal of temporary differences, and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax-

planning strategies. These assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates the Company is using to manage the underlying businesses.
The foreign NOL carryforwards in the income tax returns filed included unrecognized tax benefits taken in prior years. The NOLs for which a deferred tax asset is recognized for financial statement purposes in accordance with ASC 740 are presented net of these unrecognized tax benefits.
The Company continues to evaluate the ability to realize all of its net deferred tax assets at each reporting date and records a benefit for deferred tax assets to the extent it has deferred tax liabilities that provide a source of income to benefit the deferred tax asset. As a result of this analysis, the Company recorded a valuation allowance against the net deferred tax assets of certain foreign jurisdictions as the realization of these assets is not more likely than not, given uncertainty of future earnings in these jurisdictions. The valuation allowance increased by $1.6 million and decreased by $7.7 million during the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. The increase in tax year ended December 31, 2020 is primarily related to NOL and tax credits generated during the period and a decrease in deferred tax liabilities, partially offset by decreases in other deferred tax assets due to current year activity. The decrease in tax year ended December 31, 2019 is primarily related to utilization of NOL carryforwards.
The Company is subject to taxation in the United States and various states and foreign jurisdictions. As of December 31, 2020, the Company’s tax years for 2017 through 2020 are subject to examination by the tax authorities. With few exceptions, as of December 31, 2020, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state, local, or foreign examinations by tax authorities for years before 2016. Due to the amended returns filed to carryback NOLs under the CARES Act, U.S. federal tax returns for years 2013 - 2016 remain subject to future examination by the tax authorities. Additionally, to the extent we utilize our NOL carryforwards in the future, the tax years in which the attribute was generated may still be adjusted upon examination by the tax authorities in the future period when the attribute is utilized.
The Company is currently under income tax examinations in Illinois for the tax years 2014 through 2015, Colorado for tax years 2014 through 2017, and Massachusetts for the tax years 2015 through 2017. The Company does not believe that the results of this audit will have a material effect on its financial position or results of operations.
In 2017, the TCJA included a transition tax based on undistributed, untaxed foreign earnings analyzed in aggregate. The final analysis performed by the Company resulted in an overall untaxed deficit and no transition tax. In addition, no income taxes have been provided for any remaining undistributed foreign earnings not subject to the transition tax, or any additional outside basis difference inherent in these entities, as these amounts continue to be indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations. Should the Company decide to repatriate the foreign earnings, it would need to adjust its income tax provision in the period it determined that the earnings will no longer be indefinitely invested outside the United States. Due to the timing and circumstances of repatriation of such earnings, if any, it is not practicable to determine the unrecognized deferred tax liability relating to such amounts.
In March 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (“CARES Act”) was signed into law. The CARES Act provides numerous tax provisions and other stimulus measures, including temporary changes regarding the prior and future utilization of net operating losses. The CARES Act amends the Net Operating Loss provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, allowing for the carryback of losses arising in tax years 2018, 2019 and 2020, to each of the five taxable years preceding the taxable year of loss.

Included in the balance of unrecognized tax benefits as of the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, are $2.7 million and $2.8 million, respectively, of tax benefits that, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate.
The Company recognizes interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits in interest expense. The liability for unrecognized tax benefits excludes accrued interest of $0.3 million, $0.3 million and $0.4 million, for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The Company believes that it is reasonably possible that approximately $1.1 million of its currently unrecognized tax benefits primarily related to research and development credits, which are individually insignificant, may be recognized by the end of 2021 as a result of a lapse of the statute of limitations.

19. Earnings per Common Share (“EPS”)
Basic EPS is computed based upon the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the year. Diluted EPS is computed based upon the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the year plus the dilutive effect of common stock equivalents using the treasury stock method and the average market price of the Company’s common stock for the year. The Company includes participating securities (Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock - Participation with Dividends on Common Stock that contain preferred dividend) in the computation of EPS pursuant to the two-class method. The two-class method of computing earnings per share is an allocation method that calculates earnings per share for common stock and participating securities. During periods of net loss, no effect is given to the participating securities because they do not share in the losses of the Company.

21. Legal Matters
In the ordinary course of business, the Company is regularly subject to various claims, suits, regulatory inquiries and investigations. The Company records a liability for specific legal matters when it determines that the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome is probable, and the loss can be reasonably estimated. Management has also identified certain other legal matters where they believe an unfavorable outcome is not probable and, therefore, no reserve is established. Although management currently believes that resolving claims against the Company, including claims where an unfavorable outcome is reasonably possible, will not have a material impact on the Company’s business, financial position, results of operations, or cash flows, these matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and management’s view of these matters may change in the future. The Company also evaluates other contingent matters, including income and non-income tax contingencies, to assess the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome and estimated extent of potential loss. It is possible that an unfavorable outcome of one or more of these lawsuits or other contingencies could have a material impact on the liquidity, results of operations, or financial condition of the Company.
On May 1, 2017, May 2, 2017, June 8, 2017 and June 14, 2017, four putative class actions were filed against the Company and certain of its current and former officers and directors in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey (the “Securities Law Action”). After these cases were consolidated, the court appointed as lead plaintiff Employees’ Retirement System of the State of Hawaii, which filed, on November 20, 2017, a consolidated complaint purportedly on behalf of purchasers of the Company’s common stock between February 3, 2016 and June 13, 2017. On February 2, 2018, the defendants moved to dismiss the consolidated complaint in its entirety, with prejudice. Before that motion was decided, on August 24, 2018, lead plaintiff filed a consolidated amended complaint purportedly on behalf of purchasers of the Company’s common stock between October 28, 2014 and June 13, 2017. On June 28, 2019, the Court granted defendants’ motion to dismiss the consolidated amended complaint in its entirety, without prejudice, allowing lead plaintiff to leave to amend its complaint. On August 14, 2019, lead plaintiff filed a second amended complaint. The second amended complaint asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and it alleges, among other things, that the defendants made false and misleading statements of material information concerning the Company’s financial results, business operations, and prospects. The plaintiff seeks unspecified damages, fees, interest, and costs. On October 4, 2019, the defendants moved to dismiss the second amended complaint in its entirety. On May 29, 2020, the court granted in part and denied in part defendants’ motion to dismiss the second amended complaint, without prejudice. Plaintiff filed its motion for class certification on October 30, 2020, which motion remains pending. The Company believes that the asserted claims lack merit and intends to defend against all of the claims vigorously. Due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation, the Company cannot predict the outcome of the action at this time and can give no assurance that the asserted claims will not have a material adverse effect on its financial position or results of operations.
On September 15, 2017, October 24, 2017, October 27, 2017 and October 30, 2017, Company shareholders filed derivative lawsuits against certain of the Company’s current and former officers and directors and the Company (as nominal defendant) in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey (the “Derivative Suits”). On May 24, 2018, the Court

(Amounts in tables in thousands, except for per share data or unless otherwise noted)
consolidated the Derivative Suits and appointed Lisa LeBoeuf as lead plaintiff. The lead plaintiff designated as the Operative Complaint the complaint she previously had filed on October 27, 2017. On March 11, 2019, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the Operative Complaint, which the Court granted in substantial part on November 26, 2019. On December 10, 2019, the defendants filed a motion for reconsideration respecting the only claim to survive the motion to dismiss. On June 12, 2020, the Court granted the defendants’ motion for reconsideration and dismissed the remaining claim without prejudice, allowing lead plaintiff leave to amend her complaint. On July 13, 2020, lead plaintiff filed an amended complaint. The amended complaint alleges claims related to breaches of fiduciary duties and unjust enrichment. The amended complaint’s allegations relate to substantially the same facts as those underlying the Securities Law Action described above. Plaintiff seeks unspecified damages and for the Company to take steps to improve its corporate governance and internal procedures. On September 11, 2020, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint, which remains pending before the Court. The Company believes that the asserted claims lack merit and intends to defend against all of the claims vigorously. Due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation, the Company cannot predict the outcome of the action at this time and can give no assurance that the asserted claims will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations.
On March 7, 2019, Synchronoss shareholders, Beth Daniel and Juan Solis, filed a separate derivative lawsuit against certain of the Company’s current and former officers and directors and the Company (as nominal defendant) in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, asserting substantially the same allegations as those underlying the Derivative Suits and the Securities Law Action described above. Plaintiffs seek unspecified damages and for the Company to take steps to improve its corporate governance and internal procedures. On May 20, 2019, the parties stipulated to a stay of the action pending a ruling on the pending motion to dismiss in the Derivative Suits. The Company believes that the asserted claims lack merit and intends to defend against all of the claims vigorously. Due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation, the Company cannot predict the outcome of the action at this time and can give no assurance that the asserted claims will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations.
On June 11, 2020 and June 12, 2020, Company shareholders filed derivative lawsuits against certain of the Company’s current and former officers and directors and the Company (as nominal defendant) in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey (the “Demand Refused Derivative Complaints”). The Demand Refused Derivative Complaints allege claims related to breaches of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, and alleged violations of securities laws. The complaints’ allegations relate substantially to the same facts as those underlying the Securities Law Action described above. The Demand Refused Derivative Complaints further allege that each plaintiff made a demand upon the Company’s Board of Directors to investigate the alleged misconduct and that such demand was wrongfully refused. Plaintiffs seek unspecified damages and for the Company to take steps to improve its corporate governance and internal procedures. On October 20, 2020, the Court consolidated the actions and appointed co-lead plaintiffs. On December 4, 2020, co-lead plaintiffs filed a consolidated amended complaint. On February 3, 2021, the defendants filed motions to dismiss the amended complaint, which remain pending before the Court. Due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation, the Company cannot predict the outcome of the action at this time and can give no assurance that the asserted claims will not have a material adverse effect on its financial position or results of operations.
Except as set forth above, the Company is not currently subject to any legal proceedings that could have a material adverse effect on its operations; however, it may from time to time become a party to various legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of its business. The Company is currently the plaintiff in several patent infringement cases. The defendants in several of these cases have filed counterclaims. Although the Company cannot predict the outcome of the cases at this time due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation, the Company continues to pursue its claims and believes that the counterclaims are without merit, and the Company intends to defend against all of such counterclaims.

We completed an implementation of a new enterprise resource planning, or ERP, system during the first quarter of 2020. The ERP system replaced or enhanced certain internal financial, operating and other systems that are critical to our business operations. The ERP implementation affected the processes that constitute our internal control over financial reporting. Management has taken steps to ensure that appropriate controls were designed and implemented as the new ERP system was implemented.
With the exception of the ERP implementation described above, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and Rule 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) identified in connection with the evaluation of our controls performed during the year ended December 31, 2020 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Synchronoss Technologies, Inc.:
Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
We have audited Synchronoss Technologies, Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Synchronoss Technologies, Inc. (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on the COSO criteria.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive (loss) income, stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, and the related notes and financial statements listed in the Index at Item 15(a)(2) and our report dated March 15, 2021 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
Basis for Opinion
The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
