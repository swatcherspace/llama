The Knowledge Graph is a centralized database that contains all of the facts about a business and other entities.
Listings is available as a service or as a software-as-a-service, or SaaS, product. With the SaaS version of Listings, we provide the software and technology, while the customer provides the facts about their brands, including their brand name, address, phone number, hours of operation and website URL, among other facts. The customer then uploads their facts to the cloud and we then disseminate those facts to the Knowledge Network. With the service version, the business pays a monthly fee to have our employees manage the facts about its brand. Our employees then access the facts about businesses and other entities through our cloud-based software.
We believe a business is the ultimate authority on its own facts, and it is our mission to put that business in control of it, everywhere. The Listings product provides a business with a single, centralized dashboard to manage facts about its brand across the Knowledge Network.

Growth in our customer base is a key component of our strategy for revenue growth. Our success in growing our business is dependent on our ability to compete effectively against current and future competitors.
We compete in various markets, including with companies that sell software for business intelligence, data warehousing, analytics, application development, enterprise application integration, application management, project and portfolio management, enterprise architecture, enterprise security, enterprise resource planning, enterprise management and enterprise social networking, and with companies that sell software for big data, data warehousing, business intelligence, enterprise search, enterprise social networking and other software solutions. Many of these companies offer a single application or a suite of applications that address one or more of the same markets that we serve. Some of these competitors have greater financial, technical, marketing, personnel, and other resources than we do. As a result, these companies may be able to respond more quickly to new or changed opportunities and with better products, services, and prices, and they may be able to devote greater resources to the development, promotion, and sale of their applications. These factors could limit our ability to compete successfully and could result in reduced revenue and operating margins.
We also face competition from companies that sell products that enable users to perform tasks that were traditionally performed by software applications, such as task management and project management software. These applications may be offered as standalone products or as features or functions of enterprise software applications. In addition, we face competition from companies that offer a software-as-a-service, or SaaS, model for enterprise software applications.
In addition, we face competition in the market for mobile application management software from companies that offer mobile application management software that is targeted to a specific operating system or that does not address the full range of features that our solutions deliver.
Our success in the markets we serve is dependent on our continued innovation, and our success may depend on our ability to obtain patent protection for our innovations and to enforce any patents that may issue from pending applications.
The software development and licensing industries are characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and other intellectual property rights. Our business depends on our continued innovation. However, the success of our business depends, in part, upon our ability to obtain patent protection for our innovations, and the continued validity of any patents that may issue from pending

Risk and Consequences of the Company’s Business Model
The company’s business model depends on the successful development of a large number of customers. If we are not able to successfully develop and retain customers, it may be difficult to achieve or maintain profitability.
We have developed an integrated platform that puts businesses in control of their facts online with their official answers in search. As part of our platform, we work with many businesses, including those in industries that are highly competitive and those that operate on thin operating margins. As a result, the loss of any of our major customers could have a significant impact on our future growth and operating results.
We typically develop long-term relationships with our customers. We have contracts with our customers with varying terms, including contracts that include initial terms of one year, with renewals that are generally for one year and up to three years, depending on the customer, and with no contractual minimum spend requirements. We may also be subject to certain renewal provisions that require us to provide our customers with certain benefits, including certain pricing discounts, and to provide certain services that are not subject to negotiation, such as our Customer Care team.
If we are unable to successfully retain our customers or develop new customers, then our ability to grow our revenue will be negatively impacted.
The COVID-19 pandemic may continue to negatively impact our future performance.
The COVID-19 pandemic has had an unprecedented impact on the global economy and the markets in which we operate. The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in significant disruptions to our operations, including the temporary closure of all our global offices and the temporary closure of our Customer Care offices in the U.S., U.K. and Australia. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic has also had a significant impact on our customers and their businesses, which has caused many of our customers to seek to reduce their marketing spend, including on our platform. We have taken actions to minimize these impacts, such as the temporary closure of our Customer Care offices and our global offices, and we have also taken actions to reduce our costs, including the furloughs of certain employees and the temporary suspension of our share repurchase program. As a result of these and other actions, we have been able to significantly reduce the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business and operating results. However, the COVID-19 pandemic may continue to negatively impact our business for the foreseeable future, which may result in the need to take additional actions to minimize these impacts, including the temporary closure of our global offices or temporary suspension of our share repurchase program, which could have a negative impact on our future performance.
We may not be able to maintain or increase our revenue or profitability if the COVID-19 pandemic negatively impacts the businesses of our customers, which could negatively impact our operating results in the short term.
The COVID-19 pandemic has caused many of the businesses of our customers to be negatively impacted, which may result in a reduction in the amount that our customers spend on our platform. We may not be able

If we do not successfully identify and address the needs of our customers, we could lose sales and market share.
Our future success depends, in part, on our ability to identify and address the needs of our customers. We must understand our customers' needs and preferences, which we refer to as customer insight, in order to develop new and improved features that address those needs and preferences. If we fail to understand the needs of our customers, our ability to increase revenue will be impaired.
Moreover, our customers are increasingly seeking customizable and modular solutions that can be adapted to meet their unique needs and those of their businesses. If we fail to adapt our platform to meet the needs of our customers, we could experience increased churn and could lose market share, which would negatively affect our operating results.
We may be unable to increase the adoption of our platform by new customers or expand the use of our platform by existing customers.
Our ability to increase the adoption of our platform by new customers and expand the use of our platform by existing customers will depend on a number of factors, including:
our ability to develop and market new features that meet the needs of existing and potential customers;
the price of our platform;
our ability to achieve and maintain a high level of customer satisfaction;
the strength of our relationships with our reseller partners; and
the effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts.
If our customers do not adopt our platform or if we are unable to increase the adoption of our platform by new customers or expand the use of our platform by existing customers, our revenue growth could be slower than we expect.
If we are unable to maintain and improve our brand and reputation, we may be unable to attract new customers or expand the use of our platform by existing customers.
Our ability to increase the adoption of our platform by new customers and expand the use of our platform by existing customers will depend in part on our brand and reputation. We believe that the strength of our brand is material to our business and brand recognition is critical to our success.
Our business is highly dependent on the talented people who make up our company. We must attract, motivate and retain a highly skilled and dedicated team of employees if we are to achieve our business objectives. We compete with a number of different companies in attracting and retaining qualified employees. In addition, competition for qualified employees is intense, and we may be unable to hire and retain the qualified personnel necessary for the growth of our business at an acceptable cost. The loss of the services of certain members of our senior management team could adversely

Batch 23 Insights:

•limitations in our platform that are beyond our control;
•unanticipated costs and charges associated with product enhancements;
•unanticipated technical or other issues in our platform;
•failure to achieve or maintain anticipated performance quality, particularly in the mobile environment; or
•unfavorable marketplace perception of our products or services.
If we fail to manage our growth effectively, we could be forced to liquidate our assets or cease operations.
We may need to hire and train a significant number of additional personnel in the future, manage our growth effectively and successfully develop and market new features, make enhancements to our existing features, or expand our offerings into new markets, any of which may place a significant strain on our management, operational and financial resources and systems. In addition, as a result of our anticipated growth, we will be required to continue to improve and expand our internal and third-party systems and infrastructure, and to manage headcount and growth effectively, which will place a significant strain on our management, operational and financial resources and systems. If we fail to manage our growth effectively, we could be forced to liquidate our assets or cease operations.
Our ability to successfully hire, train and retain employees in key positions is critical to our business and our ability to manage our growth effectively. Our business will be harmed if we fail to successfully hire, train and retain employees, including key personnel, in these roles.
Our business and prospects depend heavily on the continued services of our executive officers and other key personnel.
The loss of any of our executive officers or key personnel, or our inability to hire, train and retain additional qualified personnel, could disrupt our operations, harm our ability to maintain or enhance our platform, and negatively affect our financial condition and operating results.
We rely heavily on the talents and efforts of our executive officers and other key personnel, including:
•Norman Paskowitz, our President and Chief Executive Officer;
•Matt McGinn, our Executive Vice President and Chief Revenue Officer;
•Susan Frechette, our Executive Vice President and Chief Marketing Officer;
•Kathryn Imdieke, our Chief Financial Officer; and
•Keith Kone, our Chief Technology Officer.
The loss of the services of any of our executive officers could significantly harm the progress of our business and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. In addition, our success depends on the continued service of our key personnel. The loss of the services of any of these individuals could significantly harm the progress of our business. To attract and retain highly skilled personnel, we have offered, and may in the future need to offer, more generous compensation packages than those of our competitors, including equity grants and, in certain cases, signing bonuses. If we are unable to do so, we may be unable to achieve our business objectives and may be forced to liquidate our assets or cease operations.
Our quarterly results may fluctuate and our quarterly and annual results may fluctuate from quarter to quarter and year to year.
Our quarterly and annual results may fluctuate significantly in the future. The following factors, among others, could cause quarterly and annual fluctuations in our revenue and operating results:
•our customers' decisions about whether to maintain or increase their subscriptions to our platform;
•our customers' willingness to adopt new products and features, including our Yext Answers product;
•our customers' willingness to purchase and implement our new products and features;
•our customers' willingness to purchase and implement new products and services from our partners, including Salesforce.com, Inc., and others;
•our customers' ability to pay for our platform and services;
•the number and size of contracts we win and the timing of their commencement and completion;
•the extent to which customers renew or expand their subscriptions with us;
•the timing and size of orders from new and existing customers, including as a result of the launch of new products and services and our customers' willingness to purchase and implement our new products and services; and
•the timing and amount of expenses related to product development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative expenses.
Further, our quarterly and annual revenues may fluctuate based on a number of factors, including:

Our customers and prospects have different needs and preferences for the type of insights they want from their data. We must continue to innovate and evolve our features to ensure that we can provide customers with the insights and tools they want and need.
If we fail to effectively market and sell our platform, we could fail to achieve sufficient revenue and operating results.
To achieve growth in revenue and operating results, we must effectively market and sell our platform. Our marketing and sales efforts require significant expenditures and are highly dependent on new customer acquisition. If we are unable to attract new customers, or if we fail to retain existing customers, our revenue and operating results will be adversely affected.
If we are unable to attract new customers and retain existing customers, our revenue and operating results will be adversely affected.
Our success depends on our ability to attract new customers, particularly those customers that purchase or subscribe to our more expensive packages with more features. We also have significant costs associated with attracting new customers, including research and development costs, marketing and advertising costs, and sales and marketing expenses. As a result, we must attract new customers in order to maintain and increase our revenue and operating results.
If we fail to manage our growth effectively, we could lose customers and our business and operating results would be harmed.
Our current business model is designed to support our current revenue levels, while also supporting our anticipated future growth. We have experienced rapid growth over the last several years, and we expect to continue to grow in the future, which will place significant demands on our management, operations and administrative infrastructure. We may not be able to successfully manage this growth, which could result in unforeseen operating difficulties and the loss of customers. If we fail to effectively manage our growth, our business and operating results will be harmed.
If we fail to manage and grow our customer base, our business and operating results will be harmed.
We must attract new customers and expand our business with existing customers. Our growth depends on our ability to attract new customers and expand our business with existing customers. If we are unable to attract new customers or increase sales to our existing customers, our revenue and operating results will be harmed.
If we fail to effectively manage our international expansion, our business and operating results will be harmed.
We have recently expanded our operations to include international customers. Our expansion has placed and will continue to place demands on our management, operations and administrative infrastructure. If we are unable to successfully manage our expansion, our business and operating results will be harmed.
If we fail to successfully address the needs of our international customers, our ability to grow our business could be impaired.
We recently expanded our operations to include international customers. Our expansion has placed and will continue to place demands on our management, operations and administrative infrastructure. If we are unable to effectively address the needs of our international customers, our revenue and operating results will be adversely affected.
If we fail to effectively manage our relationships with third-party vendors, we could lose customers and our business and operating results would be harmed.
We rely on third-party vendors to provide various services to us. If these vendors fail to perform their obligations, if we are unable to find alternative vendors or if the replacement of any of these vendors causes interruptions in their services, our business and operating results may be harmed.
If we fail to successfully manage our relationships with cloud service providers, our business and operating results will be harmed.
We use the cloud to deliver our platform and store data and information. Our success depends, in part, on our ability to effectively manage these cloud-based relationships. If we fail to successfully manage our relationships with cloud service providers, our business and operating results will be harmed.
If we fail to successfully manage our relationships with other third parties, our business and operating results will be harmed.
We work with third parties that provide services to our customers, including consultants, systems integrators, application developers and other vendors. Our success depends, in part, on our ability to effectively manage these relationships. If we are unable to successfully manage these relationships, our business and operating results will be harmed.
If we fail to successfully manage our relationships with strategic partners, our business and operating results will be harmed.
We work with strategic partners to enhance our marketing and brand development efforts. Our success depends on our ability to successfully manage these relationships.

We help our customers provide their customers with insights on products and services. For instance, we provide our customers with insights on the performance of their sales associates and their products and services, and in-store customer experience. These insights are then used to drive store-level decisions, such as how to allocate staff, when to promote products, when and where to hold promotions and how to improve the customer experience.
Our customers use our platform to perform data analysis and gain insights into various aspects of their businesses. For instance, our customers use our platform to analyze their customer data to gain insights into their customers' demographics, psychographics and shopping preferences. These insights are then used to identify customers that may be in need of a product or service, and to identify the products and services to sell to these customers.
We provide a platform that enables our customers to better serve their customers, which in turn helps our customers increase sales and enhance customer satisfaction. For instance, we provide our customers with real-time insights into customer traffic, customer interactions with products and services, and other metrics. These insights are then used to optimize customer experience. For example, our customers can use our platform to gain insights into customers' shopping preferences and in-store customer experience.
We help our customers identify and retain high-value customers. For instance, our customers use our platform to gain insights into their customers' shopping preferences, which in turn helps our customers identify and retain high-value customers.
Our ability to increase revenue and achieve profitability depends, in large part, on widespread acceptance of our platform by enterprises. As we target our sales efforts at these customers, we face greater costs, longer sales cycles and less predictability in completing some of our sales. As a result of the variability and length of the sales cycle, we have only a limited ability to forecast the timing of sales. A delay in or failure to complete sales could harm our business and financial results, and could cause our financial results to vary from period to period. Our sales cycle varies widely, reflecting differences in potential customers' decision-making processes, procurement requirements and budget cycles, and is subject to significant risks over which we have little or no control, including:
•customers' budgetary constraints and priorities;
•the need by some customers for lengthy evaluations prior to purchasing products; and
•the length and timing of customers' approval processes.
Our typical direct sales cycles for more substantial enterprise customers can often be long, and we expect that this lengthy sales cycle may continue or could even increase. In the large enterprise market, the customer’s decision to use our platform may be an enterprise-wide decision or may require the approval of senior management, which may not only lengthen the sales cycle but also reduce the likelihood of completing a sale. The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted the operations of our customers making sales cycles more complex. Delayed and more complex sales cycles could cause our operating results and financial condition to suffer in a given period. If we cannot adequately scale our direct sales force, we will experience further delays in signing new customers, which could slow our revenue growth.
The market for our platform is evolving and subject to a number of risks that could impair our growth and financial results.
The market for our platform is rapidly evolving and is subject to a number of risks that could impair our growth and financial results. For example, as the COVID-19 pandemic has progressed, the retail industry has been negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Many retailers are experiencing challenges, including a decrease in consumer traffic to their stores, a decrease in the volume of sales and a decrease in sales per square foot. These challenges have impacted our customers’ ability to generate revenue and have impacted our revenue. The COVID-19 pandemic has also adversely affected the global economy, with many businesses facing significant uncertainty and risk of disruption to their businesses. Retailers are also facing increased competition from e-commerce, which could adversely affect their revenue and profitability and increase the risk of their exiting the retail market. As a result, many customers may choose to reduce or eliminate their purchases of our services, which could adversely affect our revenue. In addition, some of our customers may choose to reduce or eliminate their purchases of our products, which could adversely affect our gross margins and profitability.

Our future growth depends on our success in attracting new customers.
Our future growth will depend on our success in attracting new customers, including the success of our sales and marketing efforts. Our future growth will depend on our success in acquiring new customers and retaining existing customers. To attract new customers, we must convince them that they will benefit from our services. For example, we must continue to develop and enhance our technology, which will require significant research and development expenditures. We must also continue to develop and expand our sales and marketing organization, which will require significant expenditures. To retain existing customers, we must continue to develop and enhance our technology and meet the needs and expectations of our customers. If we are unable to attract new customers or retain existing customers, our revenue and results of operations will be adversely affected.
